NAVIGATING THIS GUIDE
The A4S Essential Guide to Engaging the Board and Executive Management aims to provide guidance and practical examples to prepare CFOs and finance teams to engage their 
board and executive management (EM) team on sustainability as a driver of value. An informed and engaged board and EM will support the broader aim of making sustainable business, 
business as usual.
The guide sets out a typical process for engaging the board and EM using three key steps. Recognizing that different organizations have different experiences, the guide provides a 
nuanced perspective on the order of actions and reflects that the process is not necessarily linear. At the end of each step, there is a checklist that helps indicate the progress made and 
the readiness to move on to the next step.
The second part of the guide describes how the steps can be applied in regular board activities and how finance can engage the board and EM on sustainability under each activity. 
It gives examples of what the CFO and finance team can do to prepare for engaging the board, describes the role of the CFO and EM when engaging the board, and how finance can 
embed sustainability into the regular board decision-making processes. This section also explores elements of an engaged board.

INTRODUCTION FROM THE A4S CFO 
LEADERSHIP NETWORK
The need for boards of directors and executive management teams 
to focus on sustainability has never been more crucial. The range 
of issues is broad, and their complexity is increasing. The effects 
of climate change, global pandemics, and societal demands to 
address inequality are just a few examples of the pressing issues 
of our time. Organizations that will thrive in the future are those 
that can successfully integrate sustainability considerations 
into their regular business models. Doing so will require action 
from the most senior leaders of an organization – the board and 
executive management.
As trusted partners with specific expertise, CFOs and finance 
professionals are well positioned to help boards and executive 
management respond to the challenges ahead and create value. 
Finance teams already have the necessary skills and insight 
to distill issues, prioritize them and help equip leaders with 
critical information and analysis. However, for many, bringing the 
sustainability lens is new.
The A4S CFO Leadership Network created this guide with additional 
input from leading experts around the world, to whom we would 
like to give special thanks. Its objective is to assist CFOs and 
finance teams in identifying the key steps to engaging the board 
and executive management in order to embed sustainability into 
regular business.
Operating sustainably is a strategic business imperative – we hope 
this guide, its tools and case studies will help you work with the rest 
of your organization and support your CEO, executive colleagues 
and board members as we all work to address the many complex 
sustainability issues that we face today.

A4S Essential Guide to Engaging the Board and Executive Management

The purpose of the guide is to help the CFO and finance team to engage the board and 
EM in ways that will help embed sustainability into regular board and EM decision-making 
information and processes.
By focusing on the regular board activities that finance is typically involved in, the guide 
sets out ways that finance can engage the board on sustainability as a driver of value 
through these activities. It also shows what an engaged board looks like – when there 
is a high level of board engagement on sustainability across the board activities, and 
environmental and social factors are being considered in regular board decision making.
Where finance may require support to integrate sustainability into financial and business 
decision making, the guide refers to relevant guidance and tools from the A4S Essential 
Guide series, other A4S materials, as well as external resources.
WHY ENGAGE THE BOARD AND EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT ON 
SUSTAINABILITY?
The board and EM are responsible for ensuring the long-term viability of the organization 
as it fulfils its purpose, and in doing so, that the interests of its shareholders, key 
stakeholders, and the communities in which it operates are considered. Amid climate 
change, global pandemics, and other pressing environmental and social matters, the 
business case for a shift to resilient business models and a sustainable economy is 
clear. In response, the board and EM must set the tone at the top and ensure that a clear 
strategy is defined, implemented, and continually improved.
The role of the board in overseeing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters has 
also gained more attention among regulators, policymakers, and investors. A study by the 
Commonwealth Climate and Law Initiative (CCLI), in October 2019, found that the existing 
directors’ duties regimes in many jurisdictions, including the UK, the US, and Canada, are 
conceptually capable of being applied to corporate governance failures in the identification, 
assessment, oversight, and disclosure of climate risks.1  Leading ESG standards, 
guidelines, and frameworks, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Principles for 
Responsible Investment (PRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the 
International Integrated Reporting Framework, and the Task Force for Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) have clear expectations for boards to oversee ESG matters, 
covering multiple dimensions of the associated governance best practice. The world’s largest 
investors, including BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, also expect corporate boards 
to pay attention to ESG matters and many have issued board-specific guidance on ESG.2  
The largest proxy advisers, including ISS and Glass Lewis, have also updated their voting 
guidelines to be more supportive of ESG votes.3  As a result, the board and EM are under 
pressure to approach the governance and management of ESG matters in the same way as 
they would any other business imperative.
WHY DOES FINANCE HAVE A CENTRAL ROLE TO PLAY?
Finance is a trusted business partner and adviser to the board and EM. As custodians of 
value,4 the CFO and finance team have a decisive influence over financial, strategic, risk 
management, and other business decisions that help create more resilient, accountable, 
and profitable organizations.
By understanding the business case for change, finance can inform, actively support, 
and challenge the board and EM to adopt a sustainable business model that delivers 
sustainable outcomes. They can provide a multicapital context and help integrate natural, 
social, and human capital into the organization’s strategy and operations. They can also 
provide business context for sustainable-value messaging and help answer sustainable-
business-related questions from investors to the board and EM. By performing analysis 
and undertaking risk assessments, finance can add credibility to sustainable business 
practices and initiatives proposed to the board and EM by business units.

GLOSSARY
Word / phrase
Description
Capitals
Any store of value that an organization can use in the production of goods and services, or is vital to production, which needs to be 
maintained, protected, and nourished to continue to produce benefits in the future. The Value Reporting Foundation defines the following 
capitals: financial capital; manufactured capital; intellectual capital; human capital; social and relationship capital; and natural capital.5
Environmental factors / impacts 
and dependencies
Environmental factors examine how a company performs as a steward of the natural environment, and how it manages the impact of the 
environment (eg water scarcity, extreme weather, biodiversity) on business operations.
Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG)
A set of factors or criteria that are critical to the success of businesses across all sectors. Environmental factors examine how a company 
performs as a steward of the natural environment. Social factors examine how a company manages relationships with its employees, 
suppliers, customers, and the communities it operates in. Governance deals with a company’s leadership, ethical conduct and oversight, 
executive pay, audits and internal controls, and shareholder rights.6
Multicapital
Something which relates to all (or many) of the six capitals. For example, multicapital information includes natural capital, social capital, 
human capital, intellectual capital, manufactured capital, and financial capital information.
Social factors / impacts and 
dependencies
Social factors examine how a company manages relationships with, and supports resilience of, its employees, suppliers, customers, and the 
communities it operates in, and how these groups impact business operations.
Stakeholder
A party that can either affect or be affected by an organization. Stakeholders can be internal or external. Internal stakeholders are those who 
have a direct relationship with an organization, such as employees; external stakeholders are those who relate to the actions and outcomes 
of the organization, such as customers, suppliers, investors, or governments.7
Sustainability
The ability to satisfy the needs of the present generation without adversely affecting the conditions for future generations.
Sustainable business
A business that delivers financial returns in the short and long term in a way that generates positive value for society and the environment, 
operates within environmental constraints and contributes to the ongoing resilience of social and environmental systems.
Value creation
Value is created through an organization’s business model, which takes inputs from the capitals and transforms them through business 
activities and interactions to produce outputs and outcomes that, over the short, medium, and long term, create or destroy value for 
the organization, its stakeholders, society, and the environment. Value is to be interpreted by reference to thresholds and parameters 
established through stakeholder engagement and evidence about the carrying capacity and limits of resources on which stakeholders and 
organizations rely for well-being and profit, as well as evidence about societal needs, interests, and expectations.

THE BOARD’S ROLE IN SUSTAINABILITY
BOARD COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE8
Board composition is influenced by several factors, including the jurisdiction and industry 
in which the business operates, the nature of the business, its strategy, key risks, and 
culture. Board structures differ across different jurisdictions. These have implications for 
CFOs and finance teams as they prepare to engage the board and EM on sustainable 
business issues.
In the one-tier model, there is one unified board of directors with supervisory 
responsibilities for the business, but where one or more directors may also hold managerial 
responsibilities in the business. There are variations of the one-tier model to address the 
issue of board independence. For example, in the US and Canada, the CEO is commonly 
the only executive on the board and while the CFO and other executives may report 
directly to the board, they are not members of the board.
In the two-tier model, there is a supervisory board with supervisory responsibilities 
for the business and a management board with managerial responsibilities in the 
business. The executive directors on the management board decide the organization’s 
objectives and implement the necessary measures. The non-executive directors on the 
supervisory board monitor these decisions on behalf of other parties. Members of the 
supervisory board are appointed by the shareholders and can represent shareholders, 
employees, labour unions, the organization’s group holdings, business partners, creditors, 
or state representatives. Members of the management board are appointed by the 
supervisory board.
The King IV Report9 recommends the board should comprise executive directors and 
non-executive directors and, for a balance of power, the majority of non-executive directors 
should be independent. Where the executive directors provide in-depth knowledge of the 
organization, the non-executive directors are expected to bring independence, impartiality, 
and a wider perspective to the board’s decision making.
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CFO AND FINANCE TEAM IN ENGAGING THE 
BOARD AND EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT
•	 Direct contact: Depending on the board structure, the CFO, along with the CEO, may 
be executive directors of the board, having direct contact with other board members. 
This means having first-hand experience of the board characteristics, including the 
level of interest and understanding of sustainability among the board members, and 
more opportunities to engage individual board members and build relationships with 
them. In all cases, the CFO is a key member of the executive management team and 
plays an instrumental role in supporting the CEO in engaging the board and executing 
the board’s strategic decisions in the management and day-to-day operation of 
the organization.
•	 Process and time: The structure of the board may influence the CFO and finance 
team’s engagement approach. The process of decision making is likely to be faster in a 
one-tier structure because all the decisions are made and approved by a single board. 
A one-tier board, however, may be more likely to have ingrained thinking and less able 
to adapt and respond to pressing environmental and social matters. A supervisory 
board structure may bring broader external perspectives and help the organization 
stay abreast of developments and react to emerging issues in a more strategic 
manner. Decisions made by the management board in a two-tier structure, however, 
must be approved by the supervisory board for discussion and implementation by 
the management board, which can take time. This delay can be prolonged if the 
management and supervisory board disagree on a certain agenda. The CFO and 
finance team should consider the decision-making process and timeframes when 
pursuing their engagement approach.
•	 Board competence: The skills, knowledge, and experience available to a board will 
impact its decision making. In the case of the two-tier structure, the appointment of 
representative directors may provide an opportunity to add specific in-depth knowledge 
to the supervisory board. In the one-tier structure, such requirements may be 
incorporated when potential directors are nominated to shareholders for appointment. 
The CFO and finance team should consider the competence of individual board 
members when preparing to engage them on sustainability.

DIRECTORS’ DUTIES GO BEYOND SHAREHOLDER VALUE
With the evolving regulatory and investor landscape, and 
growing media scrutiny around ESG factors, directors 
are increasingly required to consider such factors 
when discharging their duties. Failure to do so could 
constitute a breach of duty of care, resulting in legal 
claims against a director in certain jurisdictions.10 While 
the in-house legal counsel would provide legal advice, 
the finance team has a significant role in supporting 
ESG-related disclosures and decision making.
Take climate change, for example. In the Directors’ 
Liability and Climate Risk: Comparative Paper – 
Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United 
Kingdom published by the Commonwealth Climate 
and Law Initiative (CCLI) in October 2019, it was found 
that the prevailing directors’ duties regimes under 
Australian, Canadian, South African, and UK laws are 
all conceptually capable of being applied to governance 
failures in the identification, assessment, oversight, and 
disclosure of climate-related financial risks.
Disclosures provide a basis for investors and regulators 
to assess whether directors are discharging their duties 
effectively. By adopting the TCFD framework, for 
example, companies can demonstrate the EM’s role 
in assessing and managing climate-related risks and 
opportunities, while the boards provide oversight. The 
finance team often plays a key part in implementing 
the TCFD recommendations and in explaining the 
disclosures to the board, investors, and regulators.
Overall, it is imperative that effective stewardship is 
transparent and that company actions demonstrate 
consideration of the needs, interests, and expectations 
of key stakeholders and the communities in which 
the company operates. According to the Future 
Boardroom Competencies™ 2020 Report, 
stewardship in the 21st century goes beyond purpose 
and will require a high level of accountability in delivering 
on promises. Organizations, and the individuals that 
lead them, hold the responsibility of delivering on a 
shared vision that drives long-term value creation while 
responding to short-term needs.
Shareholder value to stakeholder  
value to systems value
While many organizations recognize the need 
to shift from a shareholder view (that focuses 
exclusively on maximizing shareholder return) 
to a stakeholder view of capitalism (that 
considers the needs of a range of stakeholders, 
including employees, customers, suppliers, 
and local communities), leading organizations 
are moving on to a systems view – that is 
to view their operations as part of a nested 
system, bounded by, and embedded within, the 
environmental, social, and economic systems 
in which they operate.11 While this is an evolving 
area of study, organizations should enhance 
their understanding of the systems in which 
they operate, how emerging risks might impact 
their business, and how they might leverage 
opportunities.

The first step is about understanding what sustainability means for the organization, talking to relevant teams, and upskilling the finance team. It also involves assessing EM alignment 
with the strategic vision and business case for change, and understanding the board characteristics.
STEP 1: PREPARE
1.1 Understand what sustainability means for your organization
Where the organization is at the start of the journey and the board and EM are not yet engaged 
on sustainable business issues, finance may first need to work with relevant teams, such as 
sustainability, strategy, risk, operations, and human resources, to understand what enivronmental 
and social factors mean for the organization. This involves recognizing what the macro sustainability 
trends are and their implications for the organization, how it is responding to these trends in terms of 
the commitments and progress made, and how it fares against peer companies and leaders in other 
sectors.
Finance can help identify the sustainability risks and opportunities that are material to the 
organization, and then assess their impact on long-term business performance and value creation. 
Finance should develop a good understanding of how it can be an enabler for transitioning to a 
sustainable business, for example:
•	 How to embed environmental and social factors into financial decision making
•	 Whether current financial processes enable or constrain embedding these factors
•	 What are the requirements and expectations of stakeholders and communities on sustainability 
and how these affect the organization
Whether or not the board is already engaged and bought into the sustainability agenda, the finance 
team, together with the CFO, should review its own sustainability competencies and mandate to 
ensure that it is compatible with embedding sustainable solutions. 
	
The Embedded Strategies for the Sustainability Transition guide by the Embedding 
Project sets out a five-step process to develop contextual goals and embedded 
strategies, taking into account longer timeframes and a broader understanding of value 
creation. 
	
The A4S Essential Guide to Managing Future Uncertainty (pages 10–21) provides 
guidance on identifying risks from macro sustainability trends and understanding and 
assessing their impact.
	
Use the A4S Finance Sustainability Competencies Tool to understand the skills, 
knowledge, and behaviours necessary for the finance team to succeed in embedding 
sustainability.

1.2 Assess the executive management alignment around the need to embed sustainability
The CFO is a key member of the EM team and may (in some corporate structures) also be a member 
of the board, thus having direct access to engage them on sustainability. Where the CFO is not a 
member of the board, there are still ways to engage and influence the board, see ‘Step 2: Engage’.
In organizations where the CFO is engaged with, or has oversight of, sustainability, then embedding 
sustainability into the finance function and throughout the organization may happen more quickly. 
Where the CFO does not currently have sustainability in their remit or does not see it as a priority, 
the finance team would need to engage the CFO first and get them on board. Where there is a Chief 
Sustainability Officer or sustainability team in the organization, the finance team should work with 
them to engage the CFO, and then support the CFO to engage and align other EM members, before 
engaging the board.
The finance team can first consider the level of awareness, responsibility and accountability among 
the EM team to assess their alignment around the need to embed sustainability. One way to ensure 
leadership alignment is to develop a vision and business case for change. This will take time and is 
not necessarily a linear process. From raising awareness, articulating the business case for change, 
embedding sustainability into day-to-day activities and processes, to setting targets and establishing 
accountability (linking sustainability targets to executive pay for example), finance can provide 
support and monitor progress along the way. 
	
The A4S Essential Guide to Finance Culture (pages 18–21: Leadership Alignment) 
provides guidance on aligning leaders on the need to embed sustainability.
A Guide on Supporting Your CEO and Their Decision Making Around 
Sustainability by the Embedding Project provides insights on how corporate 
change agents can help influence the CEO’s thinking on sustainability and their role 
in embedding sustainability into the strategies and day-to-day decisions of their 
organizations.

1.3 Understand the board characteristics
The characteristics of the board have a significant influence on the way that its directors execute 
their responsibilities, interact with each other, make decisions and lead the organization. Before 
engaging the board on sustainability, it would be useful for the CFO and finance team to understand 
the board characteristics: governance, competencies, composition and behaviours. The company 
secretary, the CEO and other EM members who have regular communication with the board would 
be able to offer insights. Start with understanding:
•	 Their perspective on the corporate purpose and commitment to creating long-term value for the 
business and for society.
•	 Their level of interest, understanding, experience and behaviour towards environmental and 
social matters.
•	 The way they approach business decision making (rational, political, emotional, competitive).
•	 How the board’s mandate and oversight responsibilities have evolved.
•	 The narrative infrastructure (the key stories) they rely upon to justify their decision making.
•	 The dynamics of the board, the personalities, responsibilities and standpoints of individual 
members – who may be difficult to convince and who will likely give support.
There are several ways to build a sustainability-competent board, such as through integrating 
sustainability into the nomination process, educating them on material environmental and social 
matters, supporting more systems and anticipatory thinking, and deepening engagement with relevant 
stakeholders and experts. The CFO and finance team may be directly involved or have influence in 
some of these areas, as evident in the ‘Applying the steps in regular board activities’ section.
Overall, finance should stay abreast of the practices that are being implemented to build the board’s 
sustainability competencies. It may be useful to assess individual board members, in particular 
the ease with which they make connections between environmental and social matters and the 
business context.
	
Use the A4S Board Characteristics Review Tool to review the characteristics of the 
board and understand how these influence the board’s ability to provide steer and make 
decisions on sustainability.
	
Use the A4S Stakeholder Analysis and Change Management Tool to determine 
which board and EM members are friends, foes or fence sitters, and to prioritize each 
member in terms of their effect / impact.

directors by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) gives

making aligned with sustainability.

Based on the preparation work in Step 1, the finance team may need to engage the CFO and EM members first to get their buy in and support. The CFO may start to identify 
sustainability champions among the EM members and work with the corporate (company) secretary before engaging the board. During board engagement, finance can add value by 
providing information and data that is useful for decision making and explaining sustainability in the business context.
STEP 2: ENGAGE
2.1 Engage the CFO and EM
Depending on the level of understanding among EM members and how aligned they are on the need to embed sustainability 
(discussed in Step 1), the finance team may need to engage the CFO and EM members first before going to the board. This may 
be the most common path, but not the only one, and it is not necessarily a linear process.
Not all EM members will necessarily be persuadable at first, so finance may need to seek support from the more relevant or ‘on 
side’ members to begin with, eg those involved in strategic planning, risk management, and sustainability initiatives. Change is 
difficult, so make it easy for people to accept by ensuring a few leaders are demonstrating commitment. It is not necessary to 
have total buy in across the EM team before you start engaging the board; finance can bring others in iteratively over time as 
momentum builds.
Engaging the CFO
To get the CFO’s support and buy in, the finance team can start by demonstrating:
•	 How sustainability impacts the value drivers of the business
•	 How competitiors are responding
•	 How emerging sustainability risks could lead to business disruption
•	 How environmental and social factors can be integrated into what finance does
•	 How external pressures, from investors and regulators, for example, are causing businesses to rethink and change their 
business models
Once engaged, the CFO can leverage their unique role in rallying support among the EM members. They will have direct access 
and reporting duties to the CEO and the board, so are well placed to explain sustainability in the business and financial context 
and to present the long-term value creation benefits of a sustainable business.
Engaging the EM
Consider the vested interest of EM members, eg Chief Sustainability Officer in integrating sustainability across the organization, 
Head of Strategy in developing the corporate strategy, the Chief Risk Officer in assessing climate-related risks, and their 
involvement in engaging the board, eg through board committees. The CFO may take the lead in getting their broad support 
for embedding sustainability into board decision making. This could be done through board policy, the executive committee, 
or other existing organization structures. It may be useful to have regular cross-functional discussions on sustainability and to 
identify champions among the EM members. The CFO can leverage the existing engagement channels and relationships these 
EM members have with the board. Working with EM peers, the CFO can influence the CEO and the board on sustainability.

2.2 Engage the board
Get their buy in
Depending on the board characteristics (discussed in Step 1), time may be needed at the start 
to set out what the board may perceive to be new and complex ideas and concepts relating to 
sustainability. To get their buy in, the finance team should support the CFO and EM members to 
draw the board’s attention to:
•	 The environmental and social matters that are most relevant to the activities of the organization, 
the associated risks and opportunities, and how these may impact long-term business 
performance and value creation.
•	 Their fiduciary duties in addressing ESG matters, and the risk of inaction and the longer-term 
financial impact. Apply urgency but not alarmism.
•	 The regulatory requirements and investor requests concerning sustainability as a way to 
encourage questions and discussion, keeping the organization’s purpose, vision, and strategic 
objectives at the forefront.
•	 The ESG expectations of stakeholders and communities and how the organization could be 
affected when these expectations are not responded to, drawing on real-life examples, eg new 
headlines and insights.
•	 What industry peers are doing with respect to sustainability, especially any success stories you 
are able to draw their attention to. 
Draw on their expertise and bring in external experts
Each board member is expected to lend expertise to solve organizational challenges and capture 
opportunities based on their unique background and experience. They can offer industry and 
stakeholder insights, and a wide range of perspectives that lead to a more creative and balanced 
approach to decision making. The CFO and EM team should draw on this when seeking inputs 
from the board on the transition to a sustainable business. Some board members may be harder to 
convince than others, so the CFO and EM team should build on the points raised by members who 
give support and be prepared to be challenged. Consider bringing in external experts to present the 
hot topics and broader trends and to explain the technical aspects of sustainability, while ensuring 
that implications for the organization itself are emphasized.
	
Board directors’ duties and ESG considerations in decision making – a report by 
WBCSD and Baker McKenzie, explains why sustainability matters and why it should 
be included on board agendas as a matter within their remit. It draws primarily upon 
perspectives and insights from the UK and US legal and regulatory structures.
	
Use CPA Canada’s briefing: Environmental and Social Risks and Opportunities: 
Questions for Directors to Ask to suggest questions to ask the board to help them 
understand their role in overseeing environmental and social risks to the organization.
	
Use B Lab UK's Boardroom 2030 Activation Kit to encourage a new approach to 
running a board or executive management meeting. It compiles resources to help 
businesses plan their 'Boardroom 2030 activiation' and suggests questions to add to 
the agenda. 
Use Chapter Zero’s Board Toolkit to help structure a board discussion about climate 
change. It explains a five-step process to help the board understand the implications of 
climate change on the organization and how ready it is to address climate challenges.

2.2 Engage the board continued
Apply finance skills
Finance understands the value drivers of an organization and can assist in the measurement 
and analysis of social and environmental factors and their value to the organization. By providing 
multicapital information and explaining how it links to value creation and financial performance, 
eg revenue growth, access to finance, and production rate / efficiency, the board will be able to 
make more informed business decisions. Acting as a business partner across the organization, 
the finance team can provide multicapital context and allocate resources to support a sustainable 
business strategy.
Working together with the in-house sustainability team or experts, finance can help to interpret, 
apply, and communicate sustainability accounting guidance and standards to inform decisions for 
the organization. Finance also plays a key role in ensuring compliance with ESG regulatory and 
reporting requirements and responding to investor requests. As a trusted adviser to the board, 
finance is well placed to raise these matters with the board and propose the necessary responses 
to the board.
Finance should be ready to present any financial analysis and metrics to help decision making, 
but also help advise on any organizational, process, and policy changes that may be required to 
transition to a sustainable business in collaboration with relevant EM members.
Build relationships and establish accountability
The CFO, along with other EM members, may consider meeting with individual board members 
outside of the scheduled board meetings and / or inviting them to experiential events related to 
sustainability on a regular basis. These will provide opportunities to build relationships and to 
have more in-depth, strategic discussions on sustainability. The board members will then be more 
equipped to hold informed and strategic discussions on sustainability during board meetings. 
They will also have a better understanding of their responsibilities for sustainability oversight and 
establishing accountability.

Engaging the board and EM is not a one-off exercise but a continual process of improvement. Over time, the finance team will identify areas for improvement and begin to embed 
sustainability into regular board activities so that it becomes part of the regular board decision making. The finance team should continually monitor and improve the outcomes in the 
organization’s changing economic, environmental, and social context. Examples are provided in the ‘Applying the steps in regular board activities’ section.
STEP 3: EMBED AND IMPROVE
3.1 Identify areas for improvement
The process of engaging the board and EM is not necessarily a linear process. At this stage, finance should review the 
previous steps taken in ‘Prepare’ and ‘Engage’ and consider what has worked well and what areas need further work. 
Finance should also review the actions taken to embed sustainability into regular board activities, consider the changing 
stakeholder, economic, environmental, and social contexts within which the organization operates, and identify areas for further 
improvements.
The finance team should work with other functions and business units to articulate the broader changes that are necessary 
to embed sustainability across the organization, eg cultural change, new ways of working, awareness raising and upskilling, 
and new structures to facilitate collaboration. They should provide support to the CFO in presenting the case for change to the 
EM, then the board. The finance team should also ensure that improvement activities are prioritized on a risk basis, such that 
resources are applied to those areas which can deliver the most impact.

3.2 Embed sustainability across board activities
To strengthen buy in and commitment from the board and EM over time, sustainability should be 
embedded across regular board activities. In the ‘Applying the steps in regular board activities’ 
section, there are suggestions and examples to help finance to:
•	 Review the regular board activities and the role of finance.
•	 Consider how sustainability can be embedded into each of these activities and what an engaged 
board looks like.
•	 Plan how to embed sustainability into these board activities consistently over time.
•	 Act on the plan and review the results so improvements can be made.
The CFO may take the lead in formalizing a structure for accountability as the board and EM become 
more engaged and discussions on sustainability become more frequent in board meetings, eg set 
up a board-level sustainability committee, include sustainability in the Terms of Reference of board 
or board-level committees, and include sustainability in EM responsibilities.
See ‘1.2 Assess the executive management alignment around the need to embed 
sustainability’ section about establishing accountability by linking sustainability targets to executive 
pay, for example.
The finance team may be involved in developing or updating policies, procedures, and internal 
control frameworks to integrate environmental and social factors into business and finance 
processes. They may be called on to assess the impact of the associated changes and facilitate 
continual improvement.

3.3 Report progress
Supported by the finance team, the CFO should report to the board and EM members the progress 
made on embedding sustainability across the organization on a regular basis, in particular any 
action items agreed at board meetings. An effective way of doing this is to present information 
that connects their contributions and decisions around sustainability to the resulting impact on the 
organization, its stakeholders, and communities. The CFO should ensure that EM members are 
engaged when preparing this information, such that their inputs can be considered and included.
In external reporting, in addition to meeting mandatory reporting requirements, finance should 
highlight the role the board and EM play in embedding sustainability, the individual commitments 
they have made and how they are driving change and collaboration across the organization. This 
can be done by using short videos, podcasts, blogs, and quotes to tell the story. Working with the 
investor relations team, for example, provides opportunities for the board and EM to have direct 
dialogues with stakeholders and communities where possible, in particular those who have a vested 
interest in the decision making for sustainability. The exchange of views will help inform the purpose, 
direction, strategy, and sustainability of the organization. The results of such communications and 
engagement should be used to inform reviews of these and associated activities such that the 
organization continues to improve both in the eyes of its stakeholders and communities.

WHAT DOES AN ENGAGED BOARD LOOK LIKE?
We selected four regular board activities to illustrate how the steps ‘Prepare’, ‘Engage’, ‘Embed and improve’ can be 
applied, with examples of practical actions finance can take to build an engaged board. Some of these actions involve 
finance working with or supporting other teams, rather than necessarily taking the lead. Not all the recommended actions 
in a particular step need to be completed before moving on to the next step. At each step, there should be a process of 
review and continual improvement when finance will enhance its contribution to building an engaged board.
	 Use the A4S survey tool to help you 
assess how engaged your board is 
currently and what finance can do to 
build an engaged board.

PRACTICAL EXAMPLE – TELUS
At TELUS, the CFO and finance team played a leading role in integrating sustainability 
considerations into strategic planning and decision making. The sustainability 
function was aligned with finance and both teams leveraged the strong relationship 
they had with the board through quarterly reporting to engage them on sustainability. 
These efforts were complemented by initiatives that furthered the education for 
board members in areas such as climate change, bridging digital divides, and online 
safety and security.

At Yorkshire Water, finance led the organization to adopt a capitals approach, 
including engaging the board on the six capitals, such that it was integrated into the

See full case study for further information
Some organizations have a board-level sustainability committee to decide on environmental and social matters and oversee the organization’s performance against the integrated 
strategy. The committee members are likely to be ‘on side’ and championing sustainability, but they would still rely on the support of the CFO and finance team, eg in integrating 
sustainability within performance management, corporate reporting, and management information processes, and advising on the potential financial impact of sustainability risks 
and opportunities for decision making.

PRACTICAL EXAMPLE – BRITISH LAND
At British Land, our 2030 Sustainability Strategy 
includes a commitment to be net zero carbon in 
our standing portfolio. By demonstrating a strong 
business case for more sustainable buildings and 
close alignment with our corporate strategy, our 
board has been engaged and supportive from 
an early stage. Our CFO has played a key role in 
demonstrating the business case for sustainability 
and its relevance to a range of business areas.

PRACTICAL EXAMPLE – MANULIFE
At Manulife, our Board’s Corporate Governance and 
Nominating Committee oversees our sustainability 
framework. We formed the Executive Sustainability 
Council, which is supported by the Sustainability 
Centre of Expertise, a cross-functional team tasked 
with integrating sustainability into our business. We 
also have a dedicated climate change taskforce, 
chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, which drives the 
environmental pillar of our sustainability strategy.

PRACTICAL EXAMPLE – WATERCARE
At Watercare, we refreshed our strategy to ensure 
that the short-term financial value we were creating 
was not at the expense of long-term value for us and 
our stakeholders. To make the strategy succeed, 
we needed to equip our board and executive 
management with the knowledge and skills to make 
informed decisions. We developed a new template

The checklist also helps ensure we fulfil the requirements of section 172 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and is used for papers going to the investment committee, 
exco, or the board.

PRACTICAL EXAMPLE – BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT AND 
BROOKFIELD RENEWABLE PARTNERS
The Capital Markets and Treasury team at Brookfield Renewable Partners played 
an instrumental role in engaging the board and executives to enable the launch of 
a green bond framework. Initially, green bond issuance broadened our asset and 
corporate debt investor base. It was later expanded to include other capital market 
instruments, such as preferred shares. To date, we have raised CA$4 billion in green 
financing in Canada and the United States.

BRITISH LAND: ENGAGING THE BOARD AND EXECUTIVE 
MANAGEMENT ON SUSTAINABILITY
WHAT?
British Land is a UK property company that manages 
£12.7 billion of assets. We launched our new sustainability 
strategy in May 2020. Our specific commitments include 
transforming our portfolio to net zero carbon by 2030 and 
introducing a new Transition Vehicle to accelerate progress 
towards this goal. By demonstrating a strong business 
case for more sustainable buildings and close alignment 
with our corporate strategy, our board has been engaged 
and supportive from an early stage.
This approach has enabled us to integrate sustainability 
considerations into business planning, reporting and 
decision making. To deliver on our goals more effectively, 
members of our Executive Committee (exco) have clear 
sustainability objectives and these are cascaded down 
to staff at all levels of the business. Underlying this is a 
strong belief that to be successful, sustainability should be 
considered part of everyone’s role, from the board down.
WHY?
Sustainability matters to our customers who are 
increasingly concerned about the environmental and social 
impact of the buildings they occupy and our investors 
who think about the long-term value of their real estate 
investments. We need to mitigate the physical climate-
related risk that our properties are exposed to, and we 
need to work closely with local communities to develop 
places where people want to visit, work and live.
This strong business case for sustainability is recognized 
at board level so sustainability is embedded in strategy and 
risk management. At a broader level, the property industry 
is a significant producer of carbon emissions, so we are 
aware we have a real responsibility to reduce our carbon 
footprint. 
HOW?
Our then CFO, now CEO, played a key role in 
demonstrating the business case for sustainability and its 
relevance to a range of business areas. As a champion and 
sponsor for our sustainability strategy, he raised the profile 
of sustainability at board level and across the organization. 
Sustainability is increasingly part of everyone’s role at 
British Land, and individuals focused on sustainability sit 
across the wider finance and development teams. 
We engage our board and exco members on sustainability 
across four areas of activity: business strategy and 
planning; governance and risk management; corporate 
development and investment; and financial reporting and 
internal controls. We have summarized our work in these 
areas on the following pages.

BRITISH LAND:  
BOARD ACTIVITY 1: BUSINESS PLANNING AND STRATEGY
The commitments we have made in our 
2030 Sustainability Strategy – including to be net 
zero carbon by 2030 – have implications for the way we 
invest in, develop and manage our assets. We have also 
introduced a Transition Vehicle to accelerate progress 
towards net zero carbon in our standing portfolio.
SECURING BOARD APPROVAL
We approached the end of our 2020 Sustainability Strategy 
as climate change was rising up the national agenda and 
becoming more relevant to our key investors. Benefiting 
from our own experience, the experience of others and 
using the United Nation’s Sustainable Development 
Goals as a framework, we were well placed to design 
a comprehensive but targeted new strategy for 2030. 
Recognizing that sustainability touched every area of our 
business, we established a cross-function working group 
to embed sustainability within our corporate strategy more 
effectively. We were able to identify a clear business case 
on both the environmental and the social side, with more 
and more businesses looking to occupy space which is 
sustainable and to be based in places which support local 
communities. Together these factors strengthened the 
case for our new 2030 Sustainability Strategy, which we 
tested and refined with our board-level CSR Committee. 
SUSTAINABILITY OBJECTIVES
To support the new strategy, objectives have been set 
and allocated to our exco members. Finance has been 
central to developing these objectives. This approach 
is cascaded down throughout the organization, so that 
sustainability becomes part of performance management 
for all leadership and staff. All board and exco members 
are set sustainability objectives against which they are 
evaluated so progress on sustainability directly influences 
their compensation.
In this way, we are embedding sustainability as a central 
concern throughout the organization. Our goal is for 
sustainability ‘champions’ to become unnecessary as 
sustainability becomes business as usual and part of 
everyone’s role.

TRANSITION VEHICLE
We have an internal carbon price of £60 per tonne, of which one third is used to acquire 
certified offsets and the remaining two thirds is allocated to an internally ring-fenced 
Transition Vehicle for retrofitting properties. The board recognizes the fund as an innovative 
and effective way of increasing the sustainability of our property portfolio. 
To make the Transition Vehicle work, we need a clear and rational approach to allocating 
money for retrofit projects. The finance team has developed funding criteria, payback 
targets and identified clearly what we will – and will not – invest in, providing a clear 
structure for allocating funds. Template application forms have been developed to simplify 
the process for staff who identify investment opportunities which make our buildings more 
sustainable.
Finance is responsible for setting up the Transition Vehicle, tracking the spending over 
time and reporting to our CSR Committee. The structure of approvals depends on the 
project value: low-value projects may be approved by the Transition Vehicle Committee 
whereas high-value projects may need to be authorized by the Investment Committee. We 
will also report on the activities of the fund as part of our wider financial reporting, creating 
transparency on progress towards our 2030 goal.

GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE
The CFO is the sponsor of our sustainability strategy and is supported by dedicated 
sustainability experts across the wider finance function, including treasury and investor 
relations, and the development team. 
The Sustainability Committee, chaired by the CFO as a board member, is responsible 
for delivering our sustainability programme. Management staff from across the business 
– including finance, strategy, asset management, leasing, and development – are 
represented on this committee. It operates as a working group, reviewing and refining our 
strategy, and reports to the board-level CSR Committee.
The CSR committee meets three times a year. It oversees the delivery of our sustainability 
strategy, including the delivery of the pathway to net zero and the management of climate-
related risks. The committee is made up of non-executive directors only, but senior 
management team members, including the CFO, are invited to attend each meeting.
We are committed to achieving full disclosure against the TCFD recommendations by 
2021/22 and established a TCFD steering committee in 2019 to lead this. This committee, 
sponsored by the CFO, includes representatives from across the business and reports to 
both the risk and sustainability committees. Any resulting disclosure requires approval by 
the audit committee, which also takes the responsibility for overseeing the effectiveness of 
risk management, including climate risk.
The board has ultimate oversight of risk management and is updated on climate and other 
material ESG risks at least annually.

BOARD ACTIVITY 3: CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENT
To ensure that the board takes account of our impact on the community and the 
environment, and to fulfil the requirements of section 172 of the Companies Act 2006, 
we have a process in place to embed sustainability in board-level decision making. This 
includes a section 172 checklist we have developed for papers going to the Investment 
Committee, exco or the board. 
By following the checklist, the board considers the impact of our decisions on our wider 
stakeholders to ensure that British Land acts fairly between stakeholders, including 
shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers, the community and the environment. 
As a property company, we know that we need to consider our impact on the local 
community and the surrounding environment. We work closely with local communities in 
our development projects, so we can create spaces which have a positive impact – spaces 
which provide opportunities for education and employment, and support local business 
and wellbeing. The section 172 checklist also helps us to consider these key factors in our 
development and investment decisions. Our adoption of a place based approach means 
we will focus our activities on a key local issue, where we can deliver the greatest positive 
impact. This aligns us more closely with the interests and aspirations of the communities 
where we operate, increasing their influence.

BOARD ACTIVITY 4: FINANCIAL REPORTING AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
The annual reporting process, including our sustainability reports, is led by finance. The 
sustainability team is integrated within the finance function and development team, and this 
is reflected within our reporting. 
This structure also strengthens how we communicate internally and externally about 
sustainability issues. Regular financial reports are presented to exco and the board, and 
we are currently working to integrate sustainability KPIs into our quarterly reports.
The finance team, through its role in managing the Transition Vehicle, will be involved 
in monitoring the internal carbon price over time and how this fee is allocated between 
offsets and the Transition Vehicle. The finance team ensures that controls are in place so 
that the Transition Vehicle is used appropriately, and all financial information is tracked 
and reported. 
“The board wanted to have the sustainability strategy completely embedded into the corporate strategy. Since finance speaks to all stakeholders across the business, including 
the board and commercial divisions, and understands their particular motivations, we played a key role in supporting the sustainability team to get buy in from the business and 
to present the commercial case to the board. With the strategy in place, finance is involved in setting sustainability objectives, from the board through to exco and all staff, and 
monitoring progress against them on an ongoing basis. Another area where finance adds value is embedding sustainability into decision making. An example of this is by ensuring 
that the price of carbon is factored into our property investment and development decisions.”

HAVE A SUSTAINABILITY CHAMPION
Our CEO (former CFO) is a champion for sustainability 
within our organization. He attended The Prince of 
Wales’s Business & Sustainability Programme 
organized by The Cambridge Institute for Sustainability 
Leadership soon after assuming his position. He acts 
as the board sponsor for sustainability at exco and 
oversees the implementation of the sustainability 
strategy. Having a committed member of senior 
management helped to move sustainability up 
the agenda and position it as central concern for 
the business. Although we want to get to a point 
where ‘champions’ are no longer needed, having a 
committed, engaged CFO was essential to getting us 
to where we are today.
MAKE A STRONG BUSINESS CASE
Building a persuasive business case has been 
critical for demonstrating to the board and exco that 
sustainability is relevant to, and important for, British 
Land. Customers increasingly ask for more sustainable 
buildings and staying ahead of this demand enables 
us to achieve higher rents and lower vacancy rates. 
By showing the extent of interest in sustainability from 
customers, investors and regulators, we have achieved 
strong buy in from senior leadership and our finance 
team has taken the lead on this. 
 
 
 
TAP INTO ENTHUSIASM FROM YOUR STAFF
Buy in on sustainability also works from the ground 
up. We have raised awareness of sustainability among 
staff through ‘lunch and learn’ sessions. These have 
included presentations on a range of sustainability 
topics in general and our sustainability strategy in 
particular. We have found that our staff are engaged 
on this subject and we are leveraging their interest 
to spread awareness of sustainability throughout the 
organization. An employee-led network, SustainaBLe, 
has been set up to promote sustainability internally and 
build a more sustainable organization at every level.

BROOKFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT: ENGAGING OUR BOARD 
OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVES ON GREEN BOND ISSUANCE
WHAT?
Brookfield Renewable Partners, a subsidiary of Brookfield 
Asset Management, owns and operates one of the world’s 
largest publicly traded renewable power platforms. Our 
portfolio is globally diversified across 17 countries and 
four asset classes: hydro, wind, solar and transition. As a 
renewable energy business, sustainability is core to our 
operations. This means we are uniquely positioned to meet 
the needs of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
oriented investors and deliver on the growing demand for 
sustainable finance products.
In 2018, we issued our first green bond. Actively engaging 
our Board of Directors (the board) and executives was key 
to this process. Initially, issuing green bonds broadened our 
asset and corporate debt investor base. We later expanded 
to offer other capital market instruments, such as preferred 
shares. To date, we have raised US$4 billion in green 
financing in Canada and the United States.
This case study highlights the steps we took to engage the 
board and executives to educate, build consensus, and 
get financial approval for our green bond issuance. These 
steps, taken by our capital markets and treasury teams 
(our finance teams), were instrumental in enabling our 
Green Bond Framework launch.
WHY?
Due to our pure-play status in renewable power, the 
Brookfield Renewable Partners board and executives have 
always been engaged in ESG strategies that could help us 
maintain deep and diverse sources of capital. So when we 
started to explore the possibility of issuing a green bond in 
2017, the board and executives were naturally interested to 
learn more and understand the process.
By that time, green bonds had become a well-established 
debt capital markets product that aligned well with our 
status as a renewable power pure-play business. Despite 
having an already engaged board and executive team, our 
finance teams still had to build the business case and show 
that we could practically apply a Green Bond Framework 
to our business in a seamless, efficient, and cost-effective 
manner.
HOW?
Four key levers were integral to how we engaged the board 
and executives on our green bond issuance:
•	 Providing education and business cases
•	 Demonstrating credible frameworks
•	 Testing the draft programme
•	 Conducting regular programme updates
Our finance teams played a leading role in developing 
the Green Bond Framework and engaging the board and 
executives throughout the process.

ENGAGING THE BOARD 
AND EXECUTIVE 
MANAGEMENT
Providing education and business cases
Engaging the board and executives started by enhancing their knowledge of green bond 
instruments, peer benchmarks, and the benefits for our business. There were a handful of 
precedents in the market – other Canadian and international power companies had created 
similar frameworks. Thus, we could show effectively how a green bond issuance would not 
only increase our access to capital but also help broaden our asset and corporate debt 
investor base.
Our finance teams helped to create the initial business case alongside a peer and market 
analysis. This education was invaluable in creating a common understanding among the board 
and executives of the value of green bonds for our renewable energy business.
The executives and finance teams both thought the green bonds would provide access to 
an incremental source of capital over the long term. This further strengthened the board’s 
understanding of the importance of sustainability in creating long-term value for our business 
and the compelling case to broaden our investor base.
Demonstrating credible frameworks
Once we built consensus, we set out to develop a robust Green Bond Framework. It 
was important to the board and executives that we aligned our process with recognized 
international standards and investor expectations. Therefore, we worked closely with 
an experienced Canadian bank, who helped develop the content and scope of our 
Green Bond Framework and guidance on the “use of proceeds” language in the bond 
documentation.
Our collaboration with the bank, to support the development of our framework, accelerated 
the green bond issuance process. Through its established relationships, the bank helped 
us access a broader investor base and helped with our inclusion in bond indices that 
increased our bond’s liquidity. Our finance teams engaged with a second opinion provider, 
whose willingness to recognize our business’s unique attributes enabled collaboration 
throughout the review process.
Our finance teams reported our progress to the board and executives quarterly, giving 
them confidence about how we were using international green bond standards to ensure 
our framework would be well recognized by investors.
Testing the draft programme
Before presenting the Green Bond Framework, our finance teams created a draft 
programme to help them work through all the operational details with our executive team. 
The draft programme helped address questions from the board and executives on ensuring 
efficient, cost-effective execution. Firstly, we could show that the Green Bond Framework 
simply formalized our business operations by using proceeds to fund renewable power 
projects and could be seamlessly integrated into existing processes. Secondly, we 
confirmed that issuing a green bond would not prevent other financing options. The Green 
Bond Framework sits alongside other financing instruments to support the business and 
growth strategy. Lastly, the second opinion provider for the programme provided their 
opinion that the Green Bond Framework aligns with the four core components of the 
Green Bond Principles. 
Conducting regular programme updates
The finance teams continue to deploy the Green Bond Framework, review market trends, 
and conduct in-depth analysis to track bond performance and pricing benefits. Working 
closely with the CFOs at Brookfield Asset Management and Brookfield Renewable 
Partners, they have expanded the framework to include preferred share securities with a 
focus on expanding our pool of capital and broadening the markets.
Ongoing communications with the board and executives on our green bond performance 
have been key to ensuring engagement. Our finance teams report on issuance execution, 
with a focus on “green” or “ESG” dedicated investor participation and the pricing benefits 
realized, where relevant. Finally, we publish information on our website on the use of 
proceeds associated with all our green issuances. This reflects our commitment to 
transparency with our stakeholders, including employees, investors and the communities in 
which we operate.

MANULIFE: ENGAGING THE BOARD AND EXECUTIVES TO 
ACCELERATE SUSTAINABILITY ACROSS OUR ORGANIZATION
WHAT?
Manulife Financial Corporation is a leading international financial services provider 
that aims to help people make their decisions easier and lives better. With our global 
headquarters in Toronto, Canada, we operate as Manulife across our offices in Canada, 
Asia, and Europe, and primarily as John Hancock in the United States.
Inspired by Accounting for Sustainability (A4S) in 2017, Manulife’s former Chief Financial 
Officer (CFO) challenged the company to think big about how Manulife could drive 
sustainability throughout the organization. He laid out the foundation of the sustainability 
governance structure for Manulife’s Executive Leadership Team to execute, before 
transitioning the responsibility to Manulife’s current CFO in 2018. Manulife’s finance leaders 
played an important role in transforming the finance function and driving the sustainable 
growth of our business. By acting as a catalyst, finance leveraged traditional financial 
analysis, risk management, accounting, and reporting expertise to inform leadership 
across the organization about strategic sustainability risks and opportunities. It further led 
the formation of the governance structure for sustainability to drive action and address the 
physical and economic transition risks of climate change.
In 2018, Manulife formed the Executive Sustainability Council, which comprises ten 
members, including our first Chief Sustainability Officer, who was hired in 2020. The 
council’s mandate is to anticipate and manage relevant environmental and social risks and 
opportunities. It reports to the board’s Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, 
which oversees our sustainability framework. The council is supported by the two internal 
cross-functional teams chaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer – the Sustainability 
Centre of Expertise and the Climate Taskforce – tasked with integrating sustainability into 
our business (see Table 1).
The council and the cross-functional teams work continuously to evolve our sustainability 
strategy and performance. They provide quarterly updates to the board to track Manulife’s 
performance against its sustainability goals. After getting the right teams in place, our 
CFO, an active member of the Executive Sustainability Council, now has oversight of the 
sustainability strategy.

ENGAGING THE BOARD 
AND EXECUTIVE 
MANAGEMENT

|---|---|
WHY?
Our ongoing engagement with the key stakeholders – 
our customers, employees, and shareholders – showed 
that sustainability is becoming increasingly important to 
them. We saw a need as a global organization to function 
more sustainably. Stakeholder feedback acted as the 
backdrop that pushed our former CFO to engage the 
board and executive team to accelerate our organization’s 
sustainability transition.
•	 Shareholders: Over the past few years, through the 
annual activities of our Shareholder Outreach Program, 
we have observed an increase in shareholders’ interest 
in how the board oversees Manulife’s environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) performance. Investors 
also asked for the reporting of this performance through 
disclosure frameworks, such as the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board.
•	 Employees: An interest in sustainability came through 
in executive leaders’ meetings with their teams. At the 
finance employee town hall meeting, our former CFO 
received questions about what Manulife is doing about 
climate change, and how we measure our progress and 
hold ourselves accountable.
•	 Customers: We have conducted research into 
consumer demand for sustainable products that 
uncovered various demographics, particularly 
millennials, female investors, and high-net-worth 
individuals, who increasingly seek investments with 
green credentials and social purpose.
HOW?
From the first Executive Sustainability Council briefing to 
the board in 2018, our CFO has played a key role in relaying 
the investors’ questions about the board’s oversight of 
environmental and social risks. We also continuously track 
the ESG evaluations by the ratings agencies and emerging 
ESG disclosure standards.
Activity 1: Identify strategic opportunities
To support the creation of the Executive Sustainability 
Council, the CFO facilitated a series of briefing meetings 
that identified opportunities and risks for incorporating 
sustainability across the organization, as well as 
collaboration opportunities among the executives.
For the first meeting with the board, finance produced an 
infographic that distilled concisely what each sustainability 
risk and opportunity mean to Manulife’s business. The tool 
showed how we addressed the challenges, disclosed our 
performance, and how Manulife’s ESG risk and opportunity 
profile was evaluated by credit rating agencies and financial 
index providers.
Activity 2: Commit to robust disclosures
Finance reviewed the emerging global trends in 
sustainability regulation and voluntary disclosure 
expectations. This led to the CFO’s decision to sign A4S’s 
Statements of Support on TCFD and Net Zero Emissions. 
Since 2019, Manulife has started to embed climate-risk 
disclosures aligned to the TCFD recommendations in the 
strategic risk section of our annual reports, which are 
approved by the board.
Activity 3: Issue a green bond
Manulife became the first global life insurance company 
to issue a green bond. The issuance process spurred 
a tangible internal discussion at the executive and the 
board level on what is ‘green’ and the role Manulife plays 
in environmental sustainability. Finance has taken the 
lead in identifying, measuring, and reporting internally and 
externally the total value of green assets. The green bond 
annual disclosures now show the environmental benefits of 
our renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainably 
managed forestry assets, such as the tonnage of avoided 
carbon emissions.
Activity 4: Develop metrics and targets
The next major step was to establish performance 
baselines and define targets and key performance 
indicators. Having committed to the A4S Statements of 
Support, finance led the measurement of the investment 
portfolio’s carbon emission profile. Finance also offered 
emission accounting and accounting controls expertise 
to enable the reduction target setting for operational 
emissions in Manulife’s Climate Action Plan and provided 
all the reporting to the Board as part of the overall 
sustainability strategy.

MANAGEMENT
The CFO continues to provide strategic oversight on strategic sustainability initiatives 
and has challenged the organization to sharpen the strategic sustainability focus and 
set meaningful targets for greater sustainability performance. In keeping with Manulife’s 
mission to make lives better and decisions easier, the organization is investing in the health 
and wellbeing of customers, employees, and communities in the transition to a zero-
carbon economy:
•	 In addition to the measurement of portfolio emissions, Manulife has committed to 
net zero emissions in our investment portfolio by 2050. The plan is to set meaningful 
emission reduction targets for the carbon-intensive sectors by May 2022 and have them 
validated by the Science-Based Targets Initiative within two years.
•	 Manulife is already carbon neutral in operations and will further reduce scope 1 and 
2 emissions by 35% by 2035. Finance has played a key role in the choice of emission 
accounting boundaries, methods, and controls.
•	 Having established the inventory of green assets, Manulife has committed to grow its 
CA$39.8 billion portfolio of green investments, including renewable energy, energy-
efficient real estate, clean transportation, and sustainably managed forestry and 
agriculture.
•	 Beginning in 2021, Manulife’s Climate Action Plan will be included in the executive 
leadership’s performance goals, in addition to diversity, equity, and inclusion, employee 
engagement, and leadership accountability.
As a result of our board and executive engagement and strategic decisions, we are 
receiving external recognition for our efforts. In 2020, Manulife was upgraded by key ESG 
rating agencies: MSCI ESG Research from ‘A’ to ‘AA’ on a CCC–AAA credit rating scale, 
and Sustainalytics has reduced the risk profile from ‘Medium ESG Risk’ to ‘Low ESG Risk’. 
Manulife is included in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI), and the organization 
has won numerous sustainability-focused awards.

To present clearly how ESG factors affect Manulife 
business, finance developed an infographic tool 
for the board. It defined sustainability and what it 
means to the organization, what has been done to 
date, proof points and opportunities, how external 
agencies evaluated the ESG performance, and how 
sustainability fits into disclosure frameworks. 
ENSURE STRONG GOVERNANCE
Manulife’s Executive Sustainability Council, composed 
of all nine members of the Executive Leadership 
Team, as well as the Chief Sustainability Officer, meets 
monthly and reports results quarterly to the board. The 
Council has a rotating chair, with two-year mandates, 
and is supported by the Sustainability Centre of 
Expertise and the Climate Taskforce, which is made up 
of cross-functional teams.

TELUS: ENGAGING THE BOARD AND EXECUTIVE ON 
INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY INTO STRATEGIC 
PLANNING AND DECISION MAKING
WHAT?
TELUS is a Canadian communications and information 
technology company with over 16 million customer 
connections spanning wireless, data, IP, voice, television, 
entertainment, video, and security. With TELUS Health, we 
are also Canada’s largest healthcare IT provider. Our social 
purpose is to leverage our technology to keep Canadians 
safe and connected while creating meaningful social 
change and enabling remarkable human outcomes.
Sustainability has been a long-standing commitment for 
our organization; we issued our first sustainability report 
20 years ago. As the organization has developed, we 
have seen a growing interest in environmental, social, 
and governance (ESG) performance alongside financial 
performance. Driven by this heightened interest among 
stakeholders, our board and executive team recognized 
the need to integrate sustainability further into strategic 
planning, decision making, and the organization’s 
operations. To achieve this, the CFO was given oversight of 
sustainability.
This case study describes how finance, within each 
functional area, took ownership of the sustainability agenda 
and ensured our board and executives were actively 
engaged throughout the process.
WHY?
In the early years of our sustainability journey, our focus 
was on reporting on corporate social responsibility across 
the organization. Over time, we saw investors, customers, 
and employees placing increasing value on ESG 
performance. When engaging with various stakeholders, 
investors in particular, our CFO noticed that besides 
concerns about the competitive and regulatory risks our 
organization was facing, there was a significant increase in 
discussions about sustainability risk.
With the intersection between ESG and financial 
performance, it is essential to put sustainability across our 
business. Embedding our sustainability team into finance 
enabled our organization to improve how we incorporate 
sustainability factors into our investments and wider 
financial decision making, shifting from a risk-based to an 
opportunity-based approach.
With finance being a trusted business partner, the team 
was in a strong position to keep the board and executives 
abreast of changes made and ensure they understood and 
bought into the underlying business need. 
HOW?
The CFO and finance team were pivotal in strengthening 
the knowledge and understanding of the board, integrating 
sustainability factors into analyzing business cases, and 
transforming decision making. Throughout this process, 
we have seen the importance of focusing on education as 
we continue to inform our organization, including our board 
members, about the value of sustainability.
The process is described on the following page.

sé TELUS
Strengthening knowledge and understanding
To embed sustainability into strategic planning and decision making, it was important to 
first strengthen the board’s knowledge and understanding of the changing agenda and 
issues at stake.
Led by the CFO, we began by enhancing the board’s knowledge of stakeholder interests 
to gain a clearer understanding of the importance of sustainability and how it was fast 
becoming a business imperative. This laid the groundwork for further education and 
discussions on sustainability risks and opportunities, and the financial implications for the 
organization. We also looked at the practices of industry peers.
With this knowledge, the board saw the need to have the right functions reporting on 
sustainability at its quarterly meetings. This led to the decision to merge corporate affairs, 
which was responsible for sustainability, with the finance team under the CFO to better 
align the sustainability and finance functions.
The case for integrating sustainability and finance was further enhanced by the strong 
relationship each team had already established with the board through quarterly reporting 
and engagement with face-to-face discussions in the meetings. Merging the two teams 
ensured robust and integrated quarterly reporting of sustainability performance and 
environmental compliance to the board and its committees.
This alignment of sustainability and finance has allowed us to integrate sustainability into 
our strategic planning and decision making. The work carried out by the finance team 
has enhanced the board’s awareness and commitment. It let us see sustainability as an 
investment in the business, shifting from a risk basis to an opportunity basis. Controllers 
of each business unit have seen an increase in employee engagement, a decrease in cost, 
and an increase in productivity.
Equipping the finance team
The finance team recognized that the first step to integrating sustainability into the business 
case analysis process was to educate themselves. We reviewed internal processes, 
budgeting, and planning to better understand the sustainability risks and benefits to the 
business. Among other things, they looked at how strong sustainability performance can 
have a positive financial impact on factors such as employee engagement, productivity, and 
recruitment and retention. In particular, the controllers responsible for human resources (HR) 
understand the metrics used by HR to measure performance in these areas.
The finance team held review sessions with the controllers, who play a significant role in 
budgeting and planning. By showing successful sustainability-related project outcomes, 
the controllers began to see how financial investments in “nontraditional” business cases 
could pay off over time, particularly when assessed cumulatively. We saw how these cases 
offered not only financial benefits but also positive environmental and social outcomes for 
the organization and its communities.
With this information, the finance team further educated the board and executive team on the 
material risks to the organization, as well as the opportunities. We addressed sustainability 
topics, such as climate change, bridging digital divides, and online safety and security.
Transforming decision making
Since the board and executive team started considering sustainability more systematically, 
we have set several strategic objectives related to environmental and social outcomes. For 
example, we set transformational climate-related goals, including net carbon neutrality for 
our operations by 2030, which were approved by the CFO. The action plans for meeting 
these objectives include managing the utilities budget and projects to retrofit lighting. The 
sustainability team is responsible for these actions, and the finance team is responsible 
for providing the funding and assessing the financial benefit of the lower energy use and 
greenhouse gas emissions. We also found that employees want to work for an organization 
with bold environmental goals and performance. This is listed as a top reason for joining 
and staying with the organization. So, we can also expect our climate-related goals to lead 
to financial benefits from enhanced employee engagement, retention, and productivity.

WATERCARE:  
INTEGRATING THE CAPITALS INTO BOARD PAPERS
WHAT?
Watercare Services Limited provides water and wastewater services to 1.7 million 
Aucklanders and the many visitors to the region from around New Zealand and overseas. 
We are New Zealand’s largest company in the water and wastewater industry. We supply 
around 356 million litres of water to Auckland every day.
At Watercare, we developed a new template for board papers to engage the board 
on an integrated approach to decision making. We used icons and descriptions of the 
six capitals on every paper we submitted to the board to ensure that discussions use 
integrated thinking.
The six capitals are:
	 Natural environment
	 People and culture
	 Customer and stakeholder relationships
	 Assets and infrastructure
	 Intellectual capital
	 Financial capital and resources
WHY?
In 2017, we refreshed our strategy to ensure that the short-term financial value that we were 
creating was not at the expense of long-term value for us and our stakeholders. We looked 
to the Integrated Reporting (<IR>) framework to help us communicate this both internally 
and externally.
To make the strategy succeed, we needed to give our board members and executive 
management the knowledge and skills to make informed decisions. They needed to 
understand the potential trade-offs between the six capitals. We wanted a way to embed 
integrated thinking into every strategic decision we made.

Watercare 2
HOW?
The finance team plays a central role in bringing together other teams from across the 
business who are involved in preparing board papers. The company secretary and 
governance manager are also key because they coordinate and edit all board papers.
We offered training to those who prepare board papers and to the executives and other 
leaders who review and approve them for submission to the board. We continue to offer 
refresher training as the process develops. We have also organized integrated thinking 
refresher workshops for our extended leadership and supply chain teams. The people 
and culture team is also looking to include a training module on integrated thinking that 
introduces the six capitals to all new employees.
The first year was a period of adjustment. The governance manager worked closely with 
the teams to develop a new template for board papers (see the example at the end of this 
case study), which included prompts for all the capitals. Now, as papers are being drafted, 
the governance manager works with the author to ensure that the capitals are considered 
and referenced in the board papers. This has been an iterative process, with the teams 
submitting board papers learning as they went.
The board had a similar learning period. We were fortunate to have a board member who 
was passionate about the six capitals and championed the adoption of integrated thinking 
from the start. This helped other board members move towards this new way of thinking.
In the second year, having used the integrated thinking approach and the template 
for some time, we noticed a marked increase in holistic decision making. Board 
members would challenge papers when capitals had not been included in the decision-
making process.
The process in action
An example of the process in action occurred in 2019 with the board and executive 
management’s response to a particularly long dry period. The extended dry weather caused 
our major water sources (our dams) to reach historically low levels as we entered the warmer 
summer months. This prompted an urgent change to our water production strategy and an 
increase in supply from a river source, which reduced demand on our dams. Historically, the 
river only accounted for 15% of total water production. Since the change in strategy, the river 
now accounts for 38% of water production. Water production from this source is significantly 
more costly than from our dams. This is partly due to additional treatment of the raw water, 
and partly due to costs of pumping the potable water over longer distances.
If the board had used a traditional decision-making approach, the financial capital would 
have dominated, and we may have chosen the cheapest option, ie continue to draw from 
our dams and hope rain would eventually replenish them. Instead, the board assessed 
the options across our six capitals and chose to draw more water from the river. Although 
this had an adverse impact on our ‘financial capital and resources’ capital (river water 
is six times more expensive to treat than gravity-fed dam water), the board understood 
the potentially greater adverse effects on our ‘natural environment’ and ‘customer and 
stakeholder relationships’ capitals. If our dam storage levels got too low, we would need 
to invoke unpopular water restrictions on Aucklanders. Aside from disrupting the daily lives 
of households, there would be wider economic implications for many large corporates (eg 
breweries), who rely on our water supply as part of their production processes. We also 
needed to consider the environmental effects of taking more water from the river source. 
Fortunately, the river is our most drought-resistant source, and the extra take was within 
the existing resource consent bounds. Taking this into account, the board was confident 
there would be no adverse effects on the natural environment.
We weighed up the impact across the six capitals and chose the more expensive short-
term option because it would create longer-term value in relation to the natural environment 
and customer and stakeholder relationships capitals (and it would be more financially 
beneficial for our customers and Aucklanders).

What is an integrated approach?
An integrated approach uses the concept of the six capitals (natural, social, human, manufactured, intellectual, and financial) to provide insight into how the company creates value over 
the short, medium and long term, both for itself and for its stakeholders. At Watercare we define the six capitals as follows:

WATERCARE: INTEGRATING THE CAPITALS INTO BOARD PAPERS
The new template for board papers looks to provide the directors with a quick overview of 
the context and key aspects of the paper. This includes:
•	 The purpose of the paper, ie whether it is for information only or for starting a 
discussion, or whether a board approval is required.
•	 Who within the Watercare team has prepared, recommended, and approved the 
submission of the paper to the board.
•	 What capitals are discussed within the body of the paper. For example, if the natural 
environment, people and culture, and finance capital and resources are the key 
discussion points in the paper, only those three icons are shown under the capital 
headings. The icons are used throughout the body of the paper to highlight where 
specific capitals are discussed in more detail.

YORKSHIRE WATER:  
ENGAGING THE BOARD ON A CAPITALS APPROACH
WHAT?
Yorkshire Water provides water and sewerage services 
in the north of England. In 2017, we adopted a capitals 
approach – the “six capitals” – and integrated this into our 
strategy, business model, and decision making at all levels.
The six capitals are: 
•	 Financial
•	 Manufactured
•	 Natural
•	 Human
•	 Intellectual
•	 Social
Each capital is an essential resource for our organization.
Finance led the approach. The Group Director of Finance, 
Regulation and Markets at the time was a major driving 
force behind the change – including engaging the board on 
the six capitals. Now our Chief Executive, she continues to 
champion capitals thinking throughout the organization.
We scheduled nine strategic insight sessions with the 
board on topics such as: the natural environment; carbon 
and climate; land and partnerships; and water and 
resources. External experts took part, challenging and 
supporting the board’s learning about sustainability and 
sustainable finance. Board-level committees have remits 
that together cover each of the six capitals, and they meet 
throughout the year.
WHY?
Our sustainability work started well before our shift to a capitals approach. Initially, we wanted to make sure we were 
planning for long-term resilience in the face of climate change. As an organization that completely depends on – and 
affects – the communities we serve and the environment in which we operate, we recognized we needed to make social 
and environmental sustainability central to our decision making.
Our thinking progressed and it became clear that sustainability for our organization was much broader than financial 
capital and climate change. Adopting the six capitals helped us to identify and focus on the big issues in our industry 
and to become a more resilient, responsive business. To ensure that the six capitals were integrated into strategic and 
business planning, we needed the board to be involved too.
HOW?
For business planning, the concept of the six capitals was quite abstract. We needed to explain the six capitals approach 
in ways that would connect with our board members, who were more used to traditional manufactured and financial 
capital. We focused on the commercial benefits, making a clear case for why this approach should be important to us as a 
business and our customers. We then needed to integrate the six capitals into regular reports to the board. Our integrated 
board pack covers financial information and financial resilience but is also much broader. The pack links back to our 
strategic goals and the six capitals, and contains both quantitative and qualitative information. We were prepared to go 
beyond the numbers to provide a narrative for parts of the six capitals that were not quantifiable.
Our board-level committees also had to reflect our commitment to the six capitals. We considered our needs and proposed 
a new structure of meaningful, strategic committees. The company secretary reviewed the structure, checking the terms of 
reference of all the committees to make sure that each of the six capitals was covered. Our committees include:
•	 Audit and risk committee – as well as being responsible for internal and external audit, this committee looks at our 
financial strength and business resilience.
•	 Remuneration committee – focuses on human capital, including diversity, social mobility, retention, culture, and 
succession planning.
•	 Social value committee – encompasses societal, environmental, and intellectual 
capital, looking at the way we make decisions, the way we behave, and the way we 
interact with customers and stakeholders.

BRINGING THE SIX CAPITALS TO LIFE
In January 2020, we held a strategy workshop with the board. We talked about what 
the board is for, using the five Ss in governance: strategy, stretch, scrutiny, support, 
and stewardship.
The concept of stewardship helped to bring the capitals to life for our board. Good 
stewardship means we are making the right decisions for the organization and looking after 
our assets – and, for us, those assets are represented by the six capitals. Explaining it this 
way helped show that the six capitals make up our organizational value.
Our board includes representatives from investors. This is a group that can be more 
concerned with hard financial data and cash flow models than sustainability as they 
focus on meeting their own organizations’ financial goals. To bring them with us on our 
sustainability journey, we had to speak their language and make a clear case for why a 
capitals approach worked for investors too. We are looking at statistical models to show 
that sustainable businesses generate a much more resilient return and so are better for 
investors over the long term.
Explaining our thinking about the six capitals and our business rationale helped us to win 
the support of a range of members on our board. 
Major external threats, such as COVID-19, have also underlined the importance of capitals 
thinking for resilience and the value of having a resilient business. 
Board members no longer ask what the payback is for investing in the six capitals because 
they have shifted to a new way of thinking – they can see the value in what we are doing. 
We continue to look for ways to engage the board so they can see first hand the impact of 
our integrated approach and directly hear our stakeholders’ views on factors that impact 
our capitals. For example, our former CFO arranged an on-site visit for board members to 
see the Living with Water initiative in Hull and, on a separate occasion, invited the chair 
of the board to the Yorkshire Land Anchor Network Event, which brought landowners 
together to tackle climate change for Yorkshire.

PREPARING AN INTEGRATED BOARD PACK
For financial data, we build on standard reporting by talking about financial resilience and 
the sustainability of our financing structure. This includes topics such as gearing, credit 
ratings and sensitivities of the data, rather than focusing on EBITDA. Our reporting is not 
only about finance; we have developed our reporting across all key strategic areas.
As an organization, we have five big goals covering people, water, the environment, 
partnership, and affordable bills. Our big goals represent what we are trying to achieve. 
We linked them to the six capitals, which represent the resources that we rely and 
impact on to deliver our goals, ie how we’ll get there. In our board reporting, we 
provide information on our progress against these goals, such as our customer service 
performance and our performance against carbon and pollution reduction measures.
There is also plenty of narrative information about our stakeholder relationships, how we 
are working with partners to improve the environment and being a responsible employer. 
For example, we provide information on how we are working with farmers in the region to 
improve carbon sequestration, water management, and food supply chain management. 
We also explain our work to improve organizational culture.
This means that our board pack is no longer solely about operational performance 
and money. It includes key information about our environmental, social and people 
performance, and how we are enhancing the six capitals. By presenting an integrated 
board pack, the board gets a holistic insight into how we are performing and creating 
value. We have found that more comprehensive information sparks better conversations – 
and that strengthens our governance and our organization.
More details of our application of the capitals approach, including the findings and 
methods used for our impact and value assessments, and case studies are here.
NEXT STEPS
We have already done a lot of work with the board and on embedding capitals thinking 
into our organization. The next step is to keep the capitals approach central to our 
corporate strategy.
To achieve this, we invited external advisers to our board sessions to stimulate our thinking 
on issues such as the environment, climate change, technology, and people – and what 
will be important over the next five to ten years.
These sessions, combined with other ongoing initiatives, are helping to ensure that the six 
capitals are embedded at the core of our corporate strategy, driving sustainable decision-
making, increasing resilience, and protecting long-term organizational value.

KEEP IT SIMPLE
Talk straightforwardly about sustainability when you engage with the board. Keep it 
simple. Use language and models they are familiar with and give them space to think 
about the issues and ask questions.  
SHOW THE BENEFITS
Be prepared to put forward the business case and the benefits. Even if you cannot 
quantify the benefits, you must show why sustainability and using multiple capitals is 
important to your business. Articulate what the payback will look like whether or not 
you have specific numbers to go with your explanation. 
BE PATIENT
Stay calm and be patient if people are struggling to understand new concepts. If 
board members don’t get it, then it’s because you need to explain it better. Don’t 
get deterred – find a different way of expressing the issues and try other methods of 
connecting people with your ideas.
BRING IN EXTERNAL ADVISERS
Welcoming external advisers can be a sign of a mature board. It helps to spark useful 
conversations and bring new ideas into the mix. The challenges we are facing now 
are profound and cannot be solved in isolation. It can only help for us all to share our 
thinking more often and openly than we have in the past and get input from outside of 
our organizations.
