- **User Requirements**: Personas, accessibility needs, usability standards, experience objectives
- **Output Specifications**: Wireframes, prototypes, design systems; formats and handoff specs
- **Quality Standards**: Consistency requirements, usability benchmarks, accessibility compliance
- **Technical Constraints**: Platform limits, development constraints, technology requirements, performance considerations
- **Timeline Parameters**: Sprints, review cycles, handoffs, testing phases
- **Success Metrics**: Criteria for user satisfaction, design effectiveness, and product success
