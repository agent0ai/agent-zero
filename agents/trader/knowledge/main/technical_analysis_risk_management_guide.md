## 1. Risk Management Fundamentals {#risk-management}

### The 1% Risk Rule

The cornerstone of professional risk management is never risking more than 1% of total portfolio value on any single trade. This principle ensures:

- **Capital Preservation**: Small losses don't significantly impact overall portfolio
- **Psychological Comfort**: Reduces emotional stress and decision-making pressure
- **Longevity**: Allows traders to survive inevitable losing streaks
- **Consistency**: Provides framework for systematic position sizing

#### Calculation Method
```
Risk Amount = Portfolio Value × 0.01
Position Size = Risk Amount ÷ Stop-Loss Percentage
```

#### Practical Example
- **Portfolio Value**: $100,000
- **Risk Per Trade**: 1% = $1,000
- **Entry Price**: $50,000 (Bitcoin)
- **Stop-Loss**: $48,500 (3% below entry)
- **Position Size**: $1,000 ÷ 0.03 = $33,333 worth of Bitcoin

### Risk-to-Reward Ratios

#### Understanding R-Multiples
- **1R Trade**: Risk $1 to make $1 (1:1 ratio)
- **2R Trade**: Risk $1 to make $2 (1:2 ratio)
- **3R Trade**: Risk $1 to make $3 (1:3 ratio)
- **Minimum Standard**: Target minimum 1:2 risk-reward for profitability

#### Win Rate Requirements
- **1R Trades**: Need >50% win rate for profitability
- **2R Trades**: Need >33% win rate for profitability
- **3R Trades**: Need >25% win rate for profitability
- **Strategy Selection**: Choose based on personal trading style and market conditions

### Stop-Loss Implementation

#### Technical Stop-Loss Placement
- **Below Support**: Place stops just below key support levels
- **Above Resistance**: Place stops just above key resistance levels
- **Buffer Zone**: Add small buffer to account for false breakouts
- **Volume Confirmation**: Require volume confirmation for stop triggers

#### ATR-Based Stop-Loss
- **Conservative**: 1.5-2.0 × ATR for tight stops
- **Standard**: 2.0-3.0 × ATR for normal volatility
- **Aggressive**: 3.0-4.0 × ATR for high volatility periods
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Adjust multiplier based on market conditions

### Leverage Management

#### Understanding Leverage in Crypto
- **Purpose**: Bridge gap between calculated position size and available capital
- **Risk Control**: Leverage doesn't change risk if position sizing is correct
- **Calculation**: Required Leverage = Position Size ÷ Account Size
- **Platform Selection**: Choose platforms allowing precise leverage adjustment

#### Leverage Implementation Example
- **Account Size**: $10,000
- **Calculated Position**: $16,129 (based on 1% risk and stop distance)
- **Required Leverage**: $16,129 ÷ $10,000 = 1.61x
- **Platform Setting**: Set leverage to 1.61x on trading platform

## 2. Technical Analysis Framework {#technical-analysis}

### Essential Technical Indicators

- **Execution Timeframe**: 1-minute to 5-minute for precise timing

#### Analysis Process
1. **Trend Identification**: Determine overall direction on higher timeframes
2. **Setup Recognition**: Find trading opportunities on intermediate timeframes
3. **Entry Timing**: Use lower timeframes for precise entry points
4. **Exit Management**: Monitor all timeframes for exit signals

### Support and Resistance Analysis

#### Level Identification
- **Horizontal Levels**: Previous highs, lows, and psychological numbers
- **Trend Lines**: Dynamic support and resistance in trending markets
- **Moving Averages**: Dynamic levels that act as support/resistance

- **Round Numbers**: Psychological levels ending in 00, 50

## 3. Position Sizing and Capital Allocation {#position-sizing}

### Position Sizing Methodologies

#### Fixed Percentage Method
- **Risk Percentage**: Fixed 1-2% of portfolio per trade
- **Calculation**: Position Size = (Portfolio × Risk%) ÷ Stop Distance
- **Consistency**: Same risk amount regardless of confidence level
- **Simplicity**: Easy to calculate and implement

#### Kelly Criterion Method
```
Kelly % = (Win Rate × Average Win) - (Loss Rate × Average Loss) / Average Win
```
- **Historical Data**: Use past trades to calculate win rate and average win/loss
- **Conservative Approach**: Use 25-50% of Kelly percentage to reduce risk
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Recalculate monthly based on recent performance
- **Risk Limits**: Cap maximum position size at 5-10% regardless of Kelly result

#### Volatility-Adjusted Sizing
- **High Volatility**: Reduce position size when ATR is elevated
- **Low Volatility**: Increase position size when ATR is compressed
- **Calculation**: Base Size × (Average ATR ÷ Current ATR)
- **Limits**: Set maximum and minimum position size boundaries

### Capital Allocation Strategies

#### Portfolio Segmentation
- **Tier 1 (60-70%)**: Bitcoin and Ethereum for stability
- **Tier 2 (20-30%)**: Established altcoins for growth
- **Tier 3 (5-10%)**: High-risk, high-reward speculative positions
- **Cash Reserve**: 10-20% in stablecoins for opportunities

#### Active vs. Passive Allocation
- **Active Trading**: 20-30% of total crypto allocation
- **Passive Holdings**: 70-80% for long-term appreciation
- **Rebalancing**: Monthly rebalancing between active and passive
- **Performance Review**: Quarterly assessment of allocation effectiveness
