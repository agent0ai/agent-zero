## Part I: Automated Pattern Detection Framework

### Candlestick Pattern Classification System

Based on EODHD's comprehensive analysis, candlestick patterns are categorized by reliability and market signal strength:

#### Pattern Strength Categories

**Indecision/Neutral Patterns:**
- **Doji**: Market uncertainty, potential reversal signal
  - Characteristics: Open ≈ Close, long upper and lower wicks
  - Signal: Market indecision, potential trend reversal

**Weak Patterns (Limited Reliability):**
- **Hammer**: Bullish reversal signal at downtrend bottom
  - Detection: (High-Low) > 3×(Open-Close), body in upper 60% of range
  - Signal: Weak bullish reversal, requires confirmation
- **Inverted Hammer**: Bullish continuation pattern
  - Detection: Similar to hammer but inverted structure
  - Signal: Bullish continuation in uptrend context
- **Shooting Star**: Bearish reversal signal
  - Detection: Long upper wick, small body, minimal lower wick
  - Signal: Bearish reversal after uptrend

**Reliable Patterns (Moderate Confidence):**
- **Hanging Man**: Bearish reversal after uptrend
- **Three Line Strike**: Bullish reversal pattern
- **Two Black Gapping**: Bearish reversal signal
- **Abandoned Baby**: Bullish reversal pattern
- **Morning/Evening Doji Star**: Multi-candle reversal patterns

**Strong Patterns (High Confidence):**
- **Three White Soldiers**: Strong bullish reversal
  - Detection: Three consecutive bullish candles with progressive opens
  - Signal: Strong bullish momentum, high reliability
- **Three Black Crows**: Strong bearish reversal
  - Detection: Three consecutive bearish candles with progressive opens
  - Signal: Strong bearish momentum, high reliability
- **Morning Star**: Strong bullish reversal
- **Evening Star**: Strong bearish reversal

### Python Implementation Framework

#### Core Detection Algorithm Structure

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from eodhd import APIClient

def candle_hammer(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    """Detect hammer pattern - weak bullish reversal signal"""
    df = df.fillna(0)
    return (
        ((df["high"] - df["low"]) > 3 * (df["open"] - df["close"]))
        & (((df["close"] - df["low"]) / (0.001 + df["high"] - df["low"])) > 0.6)
        & (((df["open"] - df["low"]) / (0.001 + df["high"] - df["low"])) > 0.6)
    )

def candle_three_white_soldiers(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    """Detect three white soldiers - strong bullish reversal"""
    df = df.fillna(0)
    return (
        ((df["open"] > df["open"].shift(1)) & (df["open"] < df["close"].shift(1)))
        & (df["close"] > df["high"].shift(1))
        & (df["high"] - np.maximum(df["open"], df["close"]) < abs(df["open"] - df["close"]))
        & ((df["open"].shift(1) > df["open"].shift(2)) & (df["open"].shift(1) < df["close"].shift(2)))
        & (df["close"].shift(1) > df["high"].shift(2))
    )

def candle_doji(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    """Detect doji pattern - market indecision"""
    df = df.fillna(0)
    return (
        ((abs(df["close"] - df["open"]) / (df["high"] - df["low"])) < 0.1)
        & ((df["high"] - np.maximum(df["close"], df["open"])) > (3 * abs(df["close"] - df["open"])))
        & ((np.minimum(df["close"], df["open"]) - df["low"]) > (3 * abs(df["close"] - df["open"])))
    )
```

#### Data Acquisition and Processing

```python
def get_market_data(symbol="AAPL.US", timeframe="1h", periods=720):
    """Retrieve OHLC data for pattern analysis"""
    api = APIClient(API_KEY)
    df = api.get_historical_data(symbol, timeframe, results=periods)
    return df

def apply_pattern_detection(df):
    """Apply all pattern detection algorithms"""
    patterns = {
        'hammer': candle_hammer(df),
        'three_white_soldiers': candle_three_white_soldiers(df),
        'doji': candle_doji(df),
        'shooting_star': candle_shooting_star(df),
        'morning_star': candle_morning_star(df)
    }

    for pattern_name, pattern_signals in patterns.items():
        df[pattern_name] = pattern_signals

    return df
```

### Practical Implementation Guidelines

**Data Requirements:**
- Minimum 720 hours (30 days) of OHLC data for reliable pattern detection
- High-frequency data (1-hour intervals) recommended for crypto markets
- Clean data with proper handling of gaps and missing values

**Pattern Validation:**
- Combine multiple pattern signals for higher confidence
- Consider market context and volume confirmation
- Implement risk management for pattern-based entries

**Performance Metrics from EODHD Analysis:**
- Hammer pattern detected 67 times in 720-hour sample (S&P 500)
- Strong patterns (Three White Soldiers, Three Black Crows) show higher reliability
- Pattern effectiveness varies by market conditions and timeframe

## Part II: News-Driven Market Dynamics

### Academic Research Foundation

Recent research by Schwenkler and Zheng (2025) from Santa Clara University reveals systematic patterns in cryptocurrency markets driven by news co-mentions and peer relationships.

#### Key Research Findings

**Conditional Co-Movement Phenomenon:**
- When a cryptocurrency experiences large negative shocks (-23.5% abnormal returns), peer cryptocurrencies identified through news co-mentions exhibit significant positive abnormal returns (+6.5%)
- This mis-pricing persists for several weeks, creating profitable trading opportunities
- The effect is driven by investor overreaction to news reporting
- Pattern holds after controlling for common risk factors and correlated demand shocks

**Natural Language Processing Methodology:**
- Analysis of 200,000+ cryptocurrency news articles from Cryptocompare
- Transformer algorithms convert text to machine-processable vectors
- Deep learning classification achieves 88% accuracy in identifying peer relationships
- Peer identification based on competitive relationships mentioned in news sentences
- Methodology validated through manual labeling of 460 sentence subsample

**Market Impact Quantification:**
- 151 distinct shock events affecting 48 cryptocurrencies over 61 weeks
- Peer cryptos experience abnormally large trading volumes and turnover during events
- Effect stronger for smaller peer cryptocurrencies vs. larger ones
- Enhanced performance when peers are co-listed on same exchanges

### Trading Strategy Implementation

#### Peer Identification Algorithm

```python
def identify_crypto_peers(news_data, crypto_mentions):
    """Identify peer relationships from news co-mentions"""
    # Step 1: Extract co-mentions in same sentences
    co_mentions = extract_co_mentions(news_data)

    # Step 2: Apply transformer algorithm for text vectorization
    text_vectors = transformer_encode(co_mentions)

    # Step 3: Deep learning classification for peer relationships
    peer_relationships = classify_peer_relationships(text_vectors)

    return peer_relationships

def detect_shock_events(price_data, threshold_percentile=10):
    """Identify shock events in cryptocurrency prices"""
    # Calculate abnormal returns using risk factor models
    abnormal_returns = calculate_abnormal_returns(price_data)

    # Identify bottom decile shocks
    shock_threshold = np.percentile(abnormal_returns, threshold_percentile)
    shock_events = abnormal_returns <= shock_threshold

    return shock_events

def calculate_abnormal_returns(price_data, risk_factors):
    """Calculate abnormal returns using Liu-Tsyvinski factors"""
    # Apply cryptocurrency-specific risk factor model
    # Factors: market, size, momentum, volatility
    expected_returns = risk_factor_model(price_data, risk_factors)
    abnormal_returns = price_data['returns'] - expected_returns

    return abnormal_returns
```

#### Event-Based Trading Strategy

**Strategy Logic:**
1. **Shock Detection**: Monitor for large negative abnormal returns (bottom decile)
2. **Peer Identification**: Use news-based NLP methodology to identify peer relationships
3. **Signal Generation**: Execute long positions in peer cryptocurrencies showing positive abnormal returns
4. **Holding Period**: Maintain positions for 2-4 weeks to capture return reversal
5. **Risk Management**: Implement stop-losses and position sizing based on volatility

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Strategy generates significant positive alphas over 1-6 week holding periods
- Higher effectiveness for smaller peer cryptocurrencies
- Enhanced performance when peers are co-listed on same exchanges
- Return reversal pattern creates predictable profit opportunities

### Risk Management Framework

#### Position Sizing and Risk Controls

```python
def calculate_position_size(portfolio_value, risk_per_trade=0.02, volatility=None):
    """Calculate optimal position size based on volatility and risk tolerance"""
    if volatility is None:
        volatility = calculate_historical_volatility()

    risk_amount = portfolio_value * risk_per_trade
    position_size = risk_amount / volatility

    return min(position_size, portfolio_value * 0.1)  # Max 10% per position

def implement_stop_loss(entry_price, pattern_type, volatility):
    """Dynamic stop-loss based on pattern reliability and market volatility"""
    if pattern_type in ['three_white_soldiers', 'morning_star']:  # Strong patterns
        stop_distance = 1.5 * volatility
    elif pattern_type in ['hammer', 'doji']:  # Weak patterns
        stop_distance = 1.0 * volatility
    else:
        stop_distance = 1.25 * volatility

    return entry_price - stop_distance
```

## Part III: Integrated Trading System

### Multi-Signal Approach

**Signal Combination Framework:**
1. **Technical Patterns**: Candlestick pattern detection for entry timing
2. **News Analysis**: Peer relationship identification for opportunity discovery
3. **Market Microstructure**: Volume and volatility confirmation
4. **Risk Management**: Dynamic position sizing and stop-loss implementation

### System Architecture

```python
class IntegratedTradingSystem:
    def __init__(self, api_key, news_source, risk_params):
        self.api = APIClient(api_key)
        self.news_analyzer = NewsAnalyzer(news_source)
        self.risk_manager = RiskManager(risk_params)
        self.pattern_detector = PatternDetector()

    def scan_opportunities(self):
        """Scan for trading opportunities using multiple signals"""
        # Get market data
        market_data = self.get_market_data()

        # Detect technical patterns
        patterns = self.pattern_detector.detect_all_patterns(market_data)

        # Analyze news for peer relationships
        peer_signals = self.news_analyzer.identify_peer_opportunities()

        # Combine signals
        opportunities = self.combine_signals(patterns, peer_signals)

        return opportunities

    def execute_strategy(self, opportunities):
        """Execute trading strategy with risk management"""
        for opportunity in opportunities:
            position_size = self.risk_manager.calculate_position_size(opportunity)
            stop_loss = self.risk_manager.calculate_stop_loss(opportunity)

            if self.validate_opportunity(opportunity):
                self.place_order(opportunity, position_size, stop_loss)
