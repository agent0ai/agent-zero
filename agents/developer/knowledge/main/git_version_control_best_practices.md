# Git Version Control Best Practices and Branching Strategies

## Introduction

Git version control best practices help software development teams meet the demands of rapid changes in the industry combined with increasing customer demand for new features. The speed at which teams must work can lead teams to silos, which slows down velocity. Software development teams turn to version control to streamline collaboration and break down information silos.

Using Git best practices, teams can coordinate all changes in a software project and utilize fast branching to help teams quickly collaborate and share feedback, leading to immediate, actionable changes. Git, as a cornerstone of modern software development, offers a suite of powerful tools and features designed to streamline development cycles, enhance code quality, and foster collaboration among team members.

## Core Git Best Practices

### 1. Make Incremental, Small Changes

Write the smallest amount of code possible to solve a problem. After identifying a problem or enhancement, the best way to try something new and untested is to divide the update into small batches of value that can easily and rapidly be tested with the end user to prove the validity of the proposed solution and to roll back in case it doesn't work without deprecating the whole new functionality.

Committing code in small batches decreases the likelihood of integration conflicts, because the longer a branch lives separated from the main branch or codeline, the longer other developers are merging changes to the main branch, so integration conflicts will likely arise when merging. Frequent, small commits solves this problem. Incremental changes also help team members easily revert if merge conflicts happen, especially when those changes have been properly documented in the form of descriptive commit messages.

### 2. Keep Commits Atomic

Related to making small changes, atomic commits are a single unit of work, involving only one task or one fix (e.g. upgrade, bug fix, refactor). Atomic commits make code reviews faster and reverts easier, since they can be applied or reverted without any unintended side effects.

The goal of atomic commits isn't to create hundreds of commits but to group commits by context. For example, if a developer needs to refactor code and add a new feature, she would create two separate commits rather than create a monolithic commit which includes changes with different purposes.

### 3. Develop Using Branches

Using branches, software development teams can make changes without affecting the main codeline. The running history of changes are tracked in a branch, and when the code is ready, it's merged into the main branch.

Branching organizes development and separates work in progress from stable, tested code in the main branch. Developing in branches ensures that bugs and vulnerabilities don't work their way into the source code and impact users, since testing and finding those in a branch is easier.

### 4. Write Descriptive Commit Messages

Descriptive commit messages are as important as a change itself. Write descriptive commit messages starting with a verb in present tense in imperative mood to indicate the purpose of each commit in a clear and concise manner. Each commit should only have a single purpose explained in detail in the commit message.

The Git documentation provides guidance on how to write descriptive commit messages:

> Describe your changes in imperative mood, e.g. "make xyzzy do frotz" instead of "[This patch] makes xyzzy do frotz" or "[I] changed xyzzy to do frotz," as if you are giving orders to the codebase to change its behavior. Try to make sure your explanation can be understood without external resources. Instead of giving a URL to a mailing list archive, summarize the relevant points of the discussion.

Writing commit messages in this way forces software teams to understand the value an add or fix makes to the existing code line. If teams find it impossible to find the value and describe it, then it might be worth reassessing the motivations behind the commit.

### 5. Obtain Feedback Through Code Reviews

Requesting feedback from others is an excellent way to ensure code quality. Code reviews are an effective method to identify whether a proposal solves a problem in the most effective way possible. Asking individuals from other teams to review code is important, because some areas of the code base might include specific domain knowledge or even security implications beyond the individual contributor's attributions.

Bringing in a specific stakeholder to the conversation is a good practice and creates a faster feedback loop that prevents problems later in the software development lifecycle. This is especially important for junior developers, because through code review, senior developers can transfer knowledge in a very practical, hands on manner.

## Git Branching Strategies

A branching strategy is a set of rules or guidelines that development teams use to manage the process of writing, merging, and deploying code with the help of a version control system like Git. It defines how developers interact with a shared codebase.

Strategies like these are essential as they help in keeping project repositories organized, error-free, and avoid the unwanted merge conflicts when multiple developers simultaneously push and pull code from the same repository.

### GitFlow Workflow

GitFlow enables parallel development, allowing developers to work separately on feature branches. A feature branch is created from a master branch, and after completion of changes the feature branch is merged with the master branch.

The types of branches that are present in GitFlow for different purposes:

- **Master**: Used for product release
- **Develop**: Used for ongoing development
- **Feature Branches**: Created from the develop branch to work on specific features
- **Release Branches**: Created from the develop branch to prepare for production releases and bug fixes
- **Hotfix Branches**: Created from the master branch to address urgent issues directly in production. It helps in addressing discovered bugs smoothly, allowing developers to continue their work on the develop branch while the issue is resolved

The Master and Develop branches are the main branches that remain throughout the journey of the software. The other branches are supporting branches and are short-lived that serving specific purposes.

#### Pros of GitFlow

- Facilitates parallel development, ensuring stability in production while developers work on separate branches
- Organizes work effectively with branches for different purposes
- Ideal for managing multiple versions of production code
- GitFlow streamlines the release management process
- Ensures smooth merging of new features into the main codebase, reducing conflicts
- GitFlow offers a well-defined procedure for addressing bugs and deploying hotfixes, facilitating their rapid integration into production environments

#### Cons of GitFlow

- Complexity increases as more branches are added, potentially leading to difficulties in management
- Merging changes from development branches to the main branch requires multiple steps, increasing the chance of errors and merge conflicts
- Debugging issues becomes challenging due to the extensive commit history
- GitFlow's complexity may slow down the development process and release cycle, making it less suitable for continuous integration and delivery

### GitHub Flow

GitHub flow is a simpler alternative to GitFlow, best for smaller teams and projects. GitHub flow only has feature branches that stem directly from the master branch and are merged back to master after completing changes. There are no release branches in GitHub Flow. The fundamental concept of this model revolves around maintaining the master code in a consistently deployable condition. Which enables the seamless implementation of faster release cycles, continuous integration and delivery workflows.

The types of branches that are present in GitHub Flow are:

- **Master**: The GitHub Flow starts with the master branch, which contains the most recent stable code ready for release
- **Feature**: Developers initiate feature branches from the main branch to implement new features or address bugs. Upon completion, the feature branch is merged back into the main branch. If a merge conflict arises, developers are required to resolve it prior to finalizing the merge

#### Pros of GitHub Flow

- GitHub Flow emphasizes fast, streamlined branching, short production cycles and frequent releases, aligning well with Agile methodologies
- Teams can quickly identify and resolve issues due to the strategy's focus on fast feedback loops
- Testing and automating changes to a single branch enable quick and continuous deployment
- GitHub Flow is particularly well-suited for small teams and web applications, where maintaining a single production version is sufficient

#### Cons of GitHub Flow

- GitHub Flow is not ideal for managing multiple versions of the codebase
- The lack of development branches can lead to unstable production code if changes are not properly tested before merging
- Without separate development branches, the master branch can become cluttered, serving both production and development purposes
- As teams grow, merge conflicts may occur more frequently due to everyone merges into the same branch

### GitLab Flow

GitLab flow is more scalable alternative to GitFlow. It is designed for teams using GitLab as their version control system and offers a more flexible approach to continuous integration and automated testing. These forms the core elements of GitLab Flow, guaranteeing the stability of the master branch.

The types of branches that can be present in GitLab Flow are:

- **Master**: Main production branch housing stable release ready code
- **Develop**: Contains new features and bug fixes
- **Feature**: Developers initiate feature branches from the develop branch to implement new features or address bugs. Upon completion, they integrate the changes from the feature branch into the develop branch
- **Release**: Prior to a new release, a release branch is created from the develop branch. This branch is used to combine new features and bug fixes for the release. Upon completion, developers merge the changes from the release branch into both the develop and main branches

#### Pros of GitLab Flow

- GitLab Flow offers a robust and scalable Git branching strategy, particularly suitable for larger teams and projects
- This approach ensures a distinct separation between code under development and production-ready code, minimizing the risk of accidental changes to the production code
- With GitLab Flow, each feature is developed in its own branch, promoting independent development and reducing conflicts during integration into the main codebase
- The use of separate branches enables developers to work concurrently on different features, leading to quicker feature development

#### Cons of GitLab Flow

- GitLab Flow may pose challenges due to its complexity, particularly for teams new to Git
- Merging feature branches into the develop branch can result in conflicts, as these branches may diverge from the develop branch over time
- The GitLab Flow strategy may slow down development, as it requires merging changes into the develop branch before release. This could be problematic for teams requiring rapid release of new features and bug fixes

### Trunk Based Development

It is a branching strategy where developers work on a single "trunk" branch, mostly the master branch and use feature flags to isolate features until they are ready for release. This main branch should be ready for release any time. No additional branches are created.

The main idea behind this strategy is to make small, frequent changes to avoid merge conflicts and limit long-lasting branches. This strategy enables continuous integration and delivery, making it an attractive choice for teams aiming to release updates regularly and smoothly. It is especially useful for smaller projects or teams looking for a simpler workflow.

#### Pros of Trunk Based Development

- It keeps the trunk consistently updated, enabling continuous integration of code changes
- Developers have better visibility into each other's changes as commits are made directly to the trunk, promoting collaboration and transparency
- Without the need for branches, there is less likelihood of encountering merge conflicts or "merge hell," as developers push small changes more frequently, simplifying conflict resolution
- The shared trunk remains in a constant releasable state, allowing for faster and more stable releases due to the continuous integration of work

#### Cons of Trunk Based Development

- Requires high autonomy from developers, making it suitable for experienced teams
- It demands a considerable level of discipline and effective communication among developers to prevent conflicts and ensure proper isolation of new features
- Difficult to manage with large teams
- Maintaining backward compatibility with older releases can be challenging

## Choosing the Right Branching Strategy

Git offers a wide range of branching strategies, each suited to different project requirements and team dynamics. For beginners, starting with simpler approaches like GitHub Flow or Trunk-based development is recommended, gradually advancing to more complex strategies as needed. Feature flagging can also help reduce the necessity for excessive branching.

GitFlow is beneficial for projects requiring strict access control, particularly in open-source environments. However, it may not align well with DevOps practices. Therefore, teams seeking an Agile DevOps workflow with strong support for continuous integration and delivery may find GitHub Flow or Trunk-based development more suitable.

| Product Type | Team Size | Applicable Strategy |
|--------------|-----------|--------------------|
| Continuous Deployment and Release | Small | GitHub Flow and TBD |
| Scheduled and Periodic Version Release | Medium | GitFlow and GitLab Flow |
| Continuous deployment for quality-focused products | Medium | GitLab Flow |
| Products with long maintenance cycles | Large | GitFlow |

## Essential Git Commands for Branch Management

### Creating and Managing Branches

```bash
# Create a new branch
git branch new-feature

# Navigate to the new branch
git checkout new-feature

# Create and navigate to branch in one command
git checkout -b new-feature

# Check current branch
git branch

# Delete a branch
git branch -d branch-to-delete
```

### Working with Remote Branches

```bash
# Push branch to remote
git push origin feature-branch

# Fetch all remote branches
git fetch --all

# Track a remote branch
git checkout -b local-branch origin/remote-branch
```

### Merging and Integration

```bash
# Merge feature branch into current branch
git merge feature-branch

# Rebase current branch onto main
git rebase main

# Interactive rebase for cleaning up commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```
