# Examining the role of a quality assurance manager

Posted on Tuesday, 24th June 2025 09:30. Submitted by ILX Marketing Team

Delivering a successful project isn’t just about meeting deadlines and staying within budget. It’s also about meeting quality expectations: those defined at the outset, and those that evolve as the project progresses. That’s where the quality assurance (QA) manager comes in.

Often working behind the scenes, QA managers help to ensure that outputs meet agreed standards, processes are followed, and improvements are identified throughout the delivery lifecycle. In this blog, we examine the role of the QA manager, explore their responsibilities, and outline the skills needed to thrive in this critical function.

## What does a QA manager do?

A QA manager is responsible for establishing and overseeing quality assurance activities within a project or programme. Their role is to ensure that quality is not only built into deliverables, but also reflected in the processes and governance that support them.

In a PRINCE2® environment, quality is embedded from the start. The QA manager helps define what quality looks like, ensures that appropriate standards are in place, and verifies that those standards are being met throughout the project duration. They are distinct from team members who carry out quality control; QA managers operate independently of delivery teams to ensure that assurance activities remain objective.

## Key responsibilities of a QA manager

The responsibilities of a QA manager can vary depending on the organisation and project context, but they typically include:

- Developing the quality management approach and ensuring alignment with organisational standards

- Reviewing project documentation to ensure compliance with defined quality criteria

- Conducting audits or reviews at key stages of the project to verify adherence to processes

- Advising project teams on quality planning, control measures, and improvement opportunities

- Supporting lessons learned and continuous improvement activities across the project or portfolio

A QA manager may also contribute to board discussions or gate reviews, offering assurance that deliverables are on track to meet quality expectations and that due diligence has been followed.

## Skills needed to succeed as a QA manager

QA managers need a blend of analytical, communication, and governance-focused skills. They must be able to assess whether processes are being followed, identify where improvements are needed, and guide teams to take corrective action — without directly managing delivery.

Strong attention to detail is essential. QA managers must be able to review documentation, spot inconsistencies, and assess whether outputs align with what was agreed. This is particularly important in regulated industries or high-risk environments, where quality shortfalls can have serious consequences.

Communication skills also play a big role. QA managers need to provide constructive feedback and influence behaviours without disrupting team dynamics. Their guidance should be clear, evidence-based, and positioned as a support to successful delivery.

Familiarity with project methodologies such as PRINCE2 is highly valuable. Understanding how quality fits within structured project lifecycles, alongside plans, risks, and governance, is crucial for integrating assurance activities effectively.

## Quality assurance vs quality control

It’s important to distinguish between quality assurance and quality control. Quality control refers to the inspection and testing of deliverables, usually by the team producing them. Quality assurance, on the other hand, is about ensuring that processes and standards are in place to deliver quality consistently.

In a PRINCE2 environment, quality assurance is performed independently of the project team. It provides an objective view of whether the right controls and governance are being applied. This distinction helps safeguard against bias and ensures that quality is seen as a shared responsibility and not just a task for delivery teams.

## Continuous improvement and the value of QA

Quality assurance is not just about compliance. It’s also a driver of continuous improvement. QA managers often identify opportunities to streamline processes, improve documentation, or refine governance practices. Their work contributes to a culture of learning — where teams reflect on performance and embed better ways of working for future projects.

In organisations running multiple projects, QA managers may also play a role in standardising best practice across teams or portfolios. Their insights help shape templates, training, and process improvements that strengthen delivery across the board.

## The evolving role of QA in modern projects

As projects grow in complexity, the QA manager role is becoming more strategic. It’s no longer just about checking boxes; it’s about creating the conditions for consistent, high-quality outcomes. They offer an external lens on performance, helping project leaders make informed decisions and avoid costly rework.

For those looking to step into this role, a background in project delivery, audit, or compliance can be useful.
