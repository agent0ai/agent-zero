## Historical Foundation of Research Ethics

### The Nuremberg Code (1947)

The Nuremberg Code represents the first international ethical guidelines for human research, developed in response to Nazi medical experiments during World War II. This foundational document established ten fundamental principles:

1. **Voluntary Consent**: The voluntary consent of the study participant is absolutely essential
2. **Societal Benefit**: Experiments should yield results that benefit society and cannot be obtained otherwise
3. **Scientific Foundation**: Research must be based on previous knowledge (animal experiments, etc.)
4. **Risk-Benefit Proportionality**: Risks should be proportional to anticipated benefits
5. **Prohibition of Lethal Research**: No research should be conducted if death or disabling injury is expected
6. **Risk Limitation**: Risk should not exceed the significance of the problem being solved
7. **Protective Environment**: Adequate setting and environment must protect participants from harm
8. **Scientific Qualification**: Only scientifically qualified individuals should conduct research
9. **Participant Autonomy**: Participants can withdraw from studies at any time
10. **Researcher Responsibility**: Lead scientists must be prepared to terminate research if continuation could cause harm

### Declaration of Helsinki (1964)

Developed by the World Medical Association, the Declaration of Helsinki established ethical principles for biomedical research involving human participants. Key principles include:

- **Physician-Researcher Responsibilities**: Clear obligations to study participants
- **Informed Consent Requirements**: Comprehensive consent procedures
- **Risk-Benefit Assessment**: Systematic evaluation of potential harms and benefits
- **Vulnerable Population Protection**: Special safeguards for at-risk groups
- **Research Integrity**: Maintaining dignity and rights of all participants

*Note: The Declaration has been revised multiple times, with the most recent revision in October 2013.*

### The Belmont Report (1979)

Created by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects following the Tuskegee Syphilis Study scandal, the Belmont Report established three fundamental ethical principles:

#### 1. Respect for Persons
- **Autonomy**: Respecting individuals' capacity to make informed decisions
- **Protection**: Safeguarding persons with diminished autonomy
- **Self-Determination**: Honoring participants' choices about research involvement

#### 2. Beneficence
- **Maximize Benefits**: Promoting well-being of individuals and groups
- **Minimize Risks**: Reducing foreseeable harms and risks
- **Risk-Benefit Analysis**: Ensuring favorable risk-benefit ratios

#### 3. Justice
- **Equitable Treatment**: Fair distribution of research burdens and benefits
- **Fair Selection**: Appropriate participant recruitment and selection
- **Social Justice**: Ensuring research serves broader societal interests

## Institutional Review Board (IRB) System

### Purpose and Functions

IRBs serve as research ethics committees with the primary responsibility of protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of research participants. Core functions include:

- **Protocol Review**: Systematic evaluation of research proposals
- **Risk Assessment**: Analysis of potential physical, psychological, and social risks
- **Consent Evaluation**: Review of informed consent procedures and documents
- **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuous oversight of approved research
- **Compliance Enforcement**: Ensuring adherence to ethical standards and regulations

### IRB Composition Requirements

Federal regulations mandate specific IRB composition:

- **Minimum Five Members**: Including diverse expertise and perspectives
- **Scientific Expertise**: At least one scientist familiar with research methods
- **Non-Scientific Member**: At least one layperson representing community interests
- **Institutional Independence**: At least one member unaffiliated with the institution
- **Disciplinary Diversity**: Members representing various fields and backgrounds
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Consideration of cultural and ethnic diversity

### IRB Review Classifications

#### Exempt Research
Research that poses no more than minimal risk and falls into specific categories:

**Examples**:
- Educational research in established educational settings
- Anonymous surveys and interviews on non-sensitive topics
- Observation of public behavior (adults only)
- Analysis of existing data without identifiers
- Taste and food quality evaluation studies
- Use of existing biobanks and databases

**Key Criteria**:
- No risk beyond daily life experiences
- No vulnerable populations (unless specifically permitted)
- No collection of sensitive information
- Adequate privacy protections

#### Expedited Review
Research involving minimal risk that fits specific categories:

**Examples**:
- Blood collection from healthy adults (≤550ml in 8 weeks)
- Non-invasive biological sample collection (hair, fingernails)
- Voice, video, or image recording for research
- Behavioral research using surveys, interviews, focus groups
- Non-invasive medical procedures as part of routine care

**Process**:
- Review by IRB chair or designated members
- Faster approval timeline
- Same protection standards as full review

#### Full Board Review
Research involving more than minimal risk or vulnerable populations:

**Requirements**:
- Review by complete IRB membership
- Detailed risk-benefit analysis
- Comprehensive informed consent evaluation
- Special protections for vulnerable populations
- Ongoing monitoring requirements
