# Ethical Guidelines and the Institutional Review Board – An Introduction

*Source: Bernadette Capili & Joyce K. Anastasi, American Journal of Nursing, 2024*

## Abstract

More than 130 countries and international organizations have developed independent committees to approve or deny research that involves human subjects. These entities are often called institutional review boards (IRB), ethical review boards (ERB), independent ethics committees (IEC), or research ethics boards (REC). The institutional review board (IRB) is a research ethics committee that reviews and approves human subjects' research. **The IRB's primary responsibility is to protect research participants' rights, safety, and welfare, especially society's most vulnerable groups** (i.e., prisoners, children, educationally/economically deprived, critically/terminally ill, and individuals with mental disabilities).

## Historical Foundation of Research Ethics

### The Nuremberg Code (1947)

The Nuremberg Code is a vital document in the history of medical research ethics. The document was developed in August 1947 by American judges in response to the deadly and torturous human experiments conducted in the Auschwitz concentration camps during World War II by Nazi doctors. **The Nuremberg Code is the first set of international ethical guidelines for human research**, based on the Guidelines for Human Experimentation of 1931.

#### The Ten Principles of the Nuremberg Code:

1. **The voluntary consent of the study participant is essential.**
2. The experiment should aim to yield results that benefit society and cannot be obtained in another way.
3. The research should be based on previous knowledge (animal experiments, etc.).
4. The risks involved in the investigation should be proportional to (that is, not exceed) the anticipated benefits and conducted to avoid unwarranted physical and mental afflictions and injury.
5. The research should not be conducted if there is reason to believe that death or a disabling injury could occur.
6. The amount of risk should not surpass the significance of the problem solved by the study.
7. The setting and environment must be adequate to protect the study participant from any possibility of harm, injury, or death.
8. **Scientifically qualified individuals must conduct the research.**
9. **At any time during the study, a study participant can leave or drop out of the study.**
10. **The lead scientist of a study must be prepared to end the research at any stage if there is probable reason to believe that the continuation of the study could result in injury, disability, or death.**

### Historical Violations Post-Nuremberg

Despite the Nuremberg Code, researchers continued to exploit patients:

**Willowbrook State School for Children Hepatitis Study (1956–1971)**
- Children with mental disabilities were deliberately infected with hepatitis to develop a vaccine
- Parents provided consent but were not informed about the hazards
- Children entering the study were guaranteed admission to Willowbrook, which was cost-prohibitive for many parents

**Brooklyn Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital Study (1963)**
- Cancer cells were injected into elderly patients with dementia
- Patients could not adequately provide informed consent
- Patients were not informed that they were injected with cancer cells

These studies targeted vulnerable groups of people who could not make sound decisions for themselves. An article by Beecher (1966) brought to light 22 different examples of research that had ethical controversies, all conducted by researchers with good reputations and published in legitimate journals.

### The Declaration of Helsinki (1964)

As more ethical issues emerged with medical research, additional guidelines were formulated in 1964 by the World Medical Association (WMA) General Assembly to create safeguards for people participating in clinical research called the **Declaration of Helsinki (DoH)**.

#### Key Principles of the Declaration of Helsinki:

- **Physician-researcher responsibilities** to their study participants
- **Requirements for informed consent**
- **Assessment of risks and benefits**
- **Protection of vulnerable populations**
- **Respect for dignity and rights** of all individuals involved

The DoH was adopted in 1964 and has been revised several times, with the most recent revision in October 2013.

## Development of Institutional Review Boards in the United States

### Origins at NIH (1954)

The origin of the IRB in the United States stems from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In 1954, the NIH's research hospital, the Clinical Center, opened. Administrators were concerned with potential lawsuits when enrolling healthy study participants into research studies who might incur injury or harm.

**Initial Committee Structure:**
- Reviewed two types of studies:
  1. Studies involving "unusual hazards" to study participants (sick or normal study participants)
  2. Research that included healthy research controls (volunteers)

### Expansion to Extramural Research

Initially, the internal committee was to govern clinical research within the NIH. However, NIH administrators were concerned that they could also be held liable for extramural studies funded by grants from the agency. To avoid potential lawsuits associated with extramural research, the NIH's parent agency (the Public Health Service) required all institutions it funded to adopt a review committee similar to the one used by the Clinical Center.

### The National Research Act and the Belmont Report (1974)

The National Research Act (NRA) was passed in 1974 in response to public outcry over the **Tuskegee Syphilis Study**, where hundreds of African-American men were left untreated for syphilis, despite available effective antibiotics.

#### The Belmont Report: Three Ethical Principles

The Belmont Report was generated from the National Commission and summarized the three ethical principles required for human-subjects research:

1. **Respect for Persons**
   - Refers to respecting autonomous decisions made by individuals in making choices about their involvement in research
   - Protecting vulnerable persons in research

2. **Beneficence**
   - Obliges researchers to promote the well-being of individuals and groups involved in research
   - Maximizing benefits and minimizing foreseeable risks

3. **Justice**
   - Requires that people be treated equitably
   - The burden and benefits of research are distributed fairly

## Functions and Responsibilities of the IRB

### Primary Functions

The IRB is vital to the research process and benefits both the researchers and the participants. **The main purpose of IRBs is to protect the rights and welfare of study participants by ensuring that research is ethical and those study procedures are conducted in a way that is respectful of participants.**

#### Key Responsibilities:

1. **Risk Assessment**: Review proposed research studies to assess whether the risks to participants are minimized and reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits
2. **Informed Consent**: Ensure that adequate informed consent is obtained from all participants
3. **Protocol Review**: Approve, modify, or reject research protocols that do not meet scientific or ethical standards
4. **Ongoing Oversight**: Monitor approved research through continuing reviews
5. **Vulnerable Population Protection**: Special attention to protecting vulnerable groups

### IRB Approval Criteria

A study protocol must meet specific criteria to be approved by the IRB:

1. **Clear Scientific Purpose**: The protocol must have a clear scientific purpose
2. **Risk Minimization**: The protocol must be designed to minimize the risks to participants
3. **Confidentiality Protection**: The protocol must include procedures for protecting the confidentiality of participant information
4. **Ethical Review**: An IRB-approved research ethics committee must review and approve the protocol

#### Confidentiality vs. Privacy

- **Confidentiality**: When a study participant discloses information in a trusting relationship with the expectation that the data is not shared without their permission
- **Privacy**: Refers to the study participants' control over when and how they share information about themselves with others

## IRB Composition and Structure

### Federal Requirements for IRB Composition

The composition of the IRB is set by Federal regulations and composed of **at least five members**, including:

- **At least one scientist**
- **At least one layperson**
- **A chair**
- **A vice-chair**
- **At least one member not affiliated with the research institution**

### Expertise Requirements

The IRB must have members who are:
- **Experts in the specific type of research conducted**
- **Knowledgeable about regulations** related to the institution funding (i.e., NIH, National Science Foundation)
- **Familiar with laws and standards** set by professional organizations
- **Representative of diverse disciplines**

### Objective Review Principle

The goal of the membership requirements is founded on the belief that **an objective review best occurs when a group of individuals not involved with the investigation review the protocol** to best promote the protection of human subjects.

## IRB Review Process

### Standard IRB Process Steps:

1. **Application Submission**: The investigator obtains and completes IRB forms, submitting the IRB packet to the IRB office

2. **IRB Packet Components**:
   - Study protocol
   - Study materials (questionnaires, surveys)
   - Recruitment materials (flyers, brochures)
   - Consent forms
   - Roles and responsibilities of study team members
   - Curriculum vitae of investigators
   - Conflict of interest disclosures

3. **Pre-Review**: The IRB office conducts a pre-review of the submitted documents

4. **Review Classification**: The investigator is notified regarding the review requirements (exempt, expedited, or full-board review)

5. **IRB Review**: The IRB reviews the documents according to the classification

6. **Decision Notification**: The IRB notifies the investigator of the outcome

7. **Approval Process**: If approved, the study may begin with IRB-stamped consent forms and recruitment materials

8. **Ongoing Reviews**: Studies require at least annual IRB review, plus reviews for modifications and adverse events

9. **Study Completion**: Report to the IRB when the study is completed

## IRB Classification Systems

### Exempt Classification

To be considered 'exempt,' **the study does not expose participants to risks beyond those encountered daily**. **Investigators do not make the 'exempt' determination; the IRB makes the decision.**

#### Examples of Exempt Research:

- **Educational and classroom research** (testing a new curriculum)
- **Public observations** (children are not involved; watching what shoppers buy at the local grocery store)
- **Analysis of existing data sets**
- **Taste and food evaluation studies**
- **Use of a database or biobank**

### Minimal Risk and Expedited Review

**Minimal risk** is research in which the "probability and magnitude of physical or psychological harm does not exceed that which is ordinarily encountered in daily life or routine medical, psychological, or educational examinations, tests, or procedures of the general population."

#### Examples of Minimal Risk Studies:

- **Blood collection** via venipuncture, fingerstick, etc.
  - From nonpregnant healthy adults who weigh at least 110 pounds
  - Amount of blood cannot exceed 550ml in an 8-week time frame
  - Cannot occur more frequently than twice a week

- **Noninvasive collection** of biological samples (hair, fingernails)

- **Noninvasive data collection** not using general anesthesia or sedation, and part of routine clinical care

- **Data collected for research purposes** involving voice, video, or images

- **Research involving individual or group behaviors** or attributes using surveys, interviews, or focus groups

#### Expedited Review Process

The expedited review process is only used when the proposed research study involves **little to no risk to study participants**. The IRB chairperson conducts the review by one or more designated members of the IRB, rather than requiring a meeting with the entire board.

### Continuing IRB Reviews

**At least annually**, approved research is reviewed by the IRB, or sooner if the research could potentially result in physical, social, or psychological harm to study participants. The annual review is often called a 'continuing review' and assures those involved in the study that assessments are done regularly to help protect against any risks.

#### Continuing Review Requirements:

- **Current copy of the approved consent form**
- **Overview of the protocol's progress**
- **Scientific developments** that have occurred since the last IRB submission
- **Updates related to risks, benefits, or difficulties** for study participants

#### IRB Authority During Continuing Review

**The IRB can suspend, modify, or terminate approval of research** during the continuing review if:
- The associated research causes serious harm to participants
- The study is not conducted following Federal regulations, ethical guidelines, and/or institutional policies

## Special Considerations for Vulnerable Populations

### Defining Vulnerable Populations

Vulnerable populations include:
- **Prisoners**
- **Children**
- **Educationally/economically deprived individuals**
- **Critically/terminally ill patients**
- **Individuals with mental disabilities**

### Special Protections Required

When studying vulnerable populations, researchers must provide:

1. **Scientific justification** to support the inclusion of such individuals
2. **Methods of determining capacity** to provide consent
3. **Ways of identifying a legal representative** who can give permission on behalf of the participant
4. **Additional procedures for protecting** such individuals

### Example: Dementia Research

If an investigator is studying dementia in adults, the protocol should describe:
- Methods of determining if someone has the capacity to provide consent
- Ways of identifying a legal representative who can give permission on behalf of the participant
- Other procedures for protecting such individuals

## Informed Consent Principles

### Essential Elements of Informed Consent

1. **Voluntary Participation**: Consent must be given freely without coercion
2. **Adequate Information**: Participants must receive sufficient information to make an informed decision
3. **Comprehension**: Information must be presented in a way participants can understand
4. **Ongoing Process**: Consent is not a one-time event but an ongoing process

### Key Information to Disclose

- **Purpose of the research**
- **Procedures involved**
- **Risks and benefits**
- **Alternative treatments** (if applicable)
- **Confidentiality measures**
- **Right to withdraw** at any time
- **Contact information** for questions or concerns

## Risk-Benefit Analysis Framework

### Assessing Research Risks

The IRB evaluates risk by considering:
- **Study type and methodology**
- **Population characteristics**
- **Expected benefits**
- **Risks associated with participation**
- **Compliance with federal regulations**
- **Adequacy of participant protection measures**

### Types of Risks to Consider

1. **Physical Risks**: Bodily harm, injury, or discomfort
2. **Psychological Risks**: Emotional distress, anxiety, or trauma
3. **Social Risks**: Stigmatization, discrimination, or relationship harm
4. **Economic Risks**: Financial loss or employment consequences
5. **Legal Risks**: Potential legal liability or criminal prosecution

### Risk Minimization Strategies

- **Study design modifications** to reduce unnecessary risks
- **Enhanced safety monitoring** procedures
- **Improved participant screening** and selection criteria
- **Better training** for research staff
- **Robust data security** measures

## Contemporary Challenges in Research Ethics

### Emerging Ethical Issues

1. **Big Data and Privacy**: Challenges in protecting privacy with large datasets
2. **International Research**: Navigating different ethical standards across countries
3. **Community-Based Participatory Research**: Balancing community involvement with scientific rigor
4. **Digital Health Research**: Ethical considerations for mobile health apps and wearable devices
5. **Genetic Research**: Issues of consent, privacy, and family implications

### Balancing Innovation and Protection

Modern IRBs must balance:
- **Protecting participant welfare** while **enabling important research**
- **Maintaining scientific integrity** while **respecting cultural differences**
- **Ensuring regulatory compliance** while **promoting research efficiency**

### Evolving Regulatory Landscape

1. **Streamlined Review Processes**: Efforts to reduce administrative burden while maintaining protection
2. **Risk-Based Approaches**: Tailoring oversight to actual risk levels
3. **Central IRBs**: Reducing duplication in multi-site studies
4. **International Harmonization**: Continued efforts to align global standards

## Conclusion

The institutional review board (IRB) system represents a critical safeguard in human subjects research, evolved from the tragic lessons of historical research abuses. **The IRB's primary responsibility remains the protection of research participants' rights, safety, and welfare**, while enabling important scientific advancement.

### Key Takeaways for Researchers:

1. **Ethical review is not an obstacle** but an essential component of quality research
2. **Early engagement with IRBs** improves both the review process and research quality
3. **Ongoing ethical vigilance** is required throughout the research process
4. **Vulnerable populations require special consideration** and protection
5. **International research demands cultural sensitivity** and local expertise

### The Continuing Evolution

As research methods evolve and new ethical challenges emerge, the IRB system continues to adapt while maintaining its core commitment to participant protection. **The goal remains constant: ensuring that research advances knowledge while respecting the dignity, rights, and welfare of all participants.**

The principles established in the Nuremberg Code, Declaration of Helsinki, and Belmont Report continue to guide modern research ethics, demonstrating the enduring importance of ethical reflection in scientific inquiry. For researchers, understanding and embracing these ethical principles is not just a regulatory requirement but a professional and moral obligation.
