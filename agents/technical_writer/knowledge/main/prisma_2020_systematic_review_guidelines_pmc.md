# The PRISMA 2020 Statement: An Updated Guideline for Reporting Systematic Reviews

*Source: Matthew J Page et al., Systematic Reviews, 2021*

## Abstract

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, published in 2009, was designed to help systematic reviewers transparently report why the review was done, what the authors did, and what they found. Over the past decade, advances in systematic review methodology and terminology have necessitated an update to the guideline. **The PRISMA 2020 statement replaces the 2009 statement and includes new reporting guidance that reflects advances in methods to identify, select, appraise, and synthesise studies.** The structure and presentation of the items have been modified to facilitate implementation.

## Introduction: The Critical Role of Systematic Reviews

Systematic reviews serve many critical roles in evidence-based decision making:

- **Knowledge Synthesis**: Provide syntheses of the state of knowledge in a field, from which future research priorities can be identified
- **Addressing Complex Questions**: Address questions that otherwise could not be answered by individual studies
- **Quality Improvement**: Identify problems in primary research that should be rectified in future studies
- **Theory Development**: Generate or evaluate theories about how or why phenomena occur

**Systematic reviews therefore generate various types of knowledge for different users** (patients, healthcare providers, researchers, and policy makers). To ensure a systematic review is valuable to users, authors should prepare a transparent, complete, and accurate account of why the review was done, what they did, and what they found.

## Development of PRISMA 2020

### Methodology for Guideline Development

A complete description of the methods used to develop PRISMA 2020 involved:

1. **Literature Review**: Identified PRISMA 2009 items that were often reported incompletely by examining studies investigating transparency of reporting
2. **Document Analysis**: Reviewed 60 documents providing reporting guidance for systematic reviews
3. **Expert Survey**: 110 of 220 invited systematic review methodologists and journal editors responded to survey on proposed modifications
4. **Consensus Meeting**: 21-member, two-day, in-person meeting in Edinburgh, Scotland (September 2018)
5. **Iterative Refinement**: Circulated initial draft and five revisions throughout 2019 and 2020
6. **Final Validation**: 22 systematic reviewers provided feedback on layout and terminology

### Evidence Base for Updates

Many innovations in systematic review conduct have occurred since PRISMA 2009:

- **Technological Advances**: Natural language processing and machine learning for evidence identification
- **Synthesis Methods**: New methods to synthesise and present findings when meta-analysis is not appropriate
- **Risk of Bias Assessment**: New methods to assess risk of bias in included studies
- **Terminology Evolution**: Shift from assessing "quality" to assessing "certainty" in evidence
- **Publishing Landscape**: Multiple avenues for registering protocols, disseminating reviews, and sharing data

## Scope and Application of PRISMA 2020

### Primary Scope

**PRISMA 2020 has been designed primarily for systematic reviews of studies that evaluate the effects of health interventions**, irrespective of the design of included studies. However:

- **Broader Applicability**: Checklist items applicable to reviews of other interventions (social, educational)
- **Multiple Objectives**: Many items applicable to reviews with objectives other than evaluating interventions
- **Synthesis Flexibility**: Intended for reviews that include synthesis (meta-analysis) or do not include synthesis
- **Mixed Methods**: Relevant for mixed-methods systematic reviews (quantitative and qualitative studies)
- **Review Types**: Can be used for original, updated, or continually updated ("living") systematic reviews

### What PRISMA 2020 Is NOT

- **Not a Conduct Guide**: Not intended to guide systematic review conduct (other resources available)
- **Not a Quality Assessment Tool**: Should not be used to assess conduct or methodological quality
- **Not for Protocols**: Not intended for reporting protocols (PRISMA-P 2015 available)
- **Extensions Available**: Specific extensions exist for network meta-analyses, individual participant data, harms, diagnostic test accuracy, and scoping reviews

## Certainty of Evidence Assessment

### GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation)

The GRADE approach assesses certainty across five domains:

#### Factors that Decrease Certainty
1. **Risk of Bias**: Limitations in study design and implementation
2. **Inconsistency**: Unexplained heterogeneity or variability in results
3. **Indirectness**: Indirect evidence (population, intervention, control, outcomes)
4. **Imprecision**: Wide confidence intervals or small sample sizes
5. **Publication Bias**: Selective publication of studies

#### Factors that Increase Certainty
1. **Large Effect**: Large magnitude of effect
2. **Dose-Response Gradient**: Evidence of dose-response relationship
3. **Confounding**: All plausible confounding would reduce demonstrated effect

### Certainty Levels
- **High**: Very confident that true effect lies close to estimate
- **Moderate**: Moderately confident in effect estimate
- **Low**: Limited confidence in effect estimate
- **Very Low**: Very little confidence in effect estimate

## Reporting Bias Assessment

### Types of Reporting Bias

#### Publication Bias
- **Definition**: Tendency for studies with statistically significant results to be published
- **Detection**: Funnel plots, statistical tests (Egger's test, Begg's test)
- **Assessment**: Visual inspection and statistical evaluation

#### Selective Reporting

- **Analysis Reporting Bias**: Selective reporting of favorable analyses
- **Detection**: Comparison with protocols and trial registrations

### Assessment Methods

1. **Funnel Plots**: Visual assessment of small-study effects
