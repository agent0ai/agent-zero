## Fundamental Principles of Qualitative Research

### Definition and Scope

Qualitative research is "the systematic collection, organization, and interpretation of textual material derived from talk or conversation. It is used in the exploration of meanings of social phenomena as experienced by individuals themselves, in their natural context" (Malterud, 2001, p. 483).

### Core Characteristics

#### Focus on Meaning and Experience
- **Interpretive Nature**: Seeks to understand how individuals make sense of their experiences
- **Contextual Understanding**: Examines phenomena within their natural settings
- **Subjective Reality**: Acknowledges multiple perspectives and constructed meanings
- **Holistic Approach**: Considers the whole person and their environment

#### Researcher as Instrument
- **Active Engagement**: Researchers are not disinterested outsiders but active participants in the research process
- **Reflexivity**: Researchers must acknowledge and examine their own biases and influences
- **Emotional Data**: Researcher emotions and reactions are considered valuable data
- **Collaborative Relationship**: Participants and researchers share knowledge as partners

#### Data Types and Sources
- **Spoken Communication**: Interviews, focus groups, conversations
- **Written Texts**: Journals, letters, prayers, documents
- **Visual Materials**: Drawings, photographs, videos
- **Observational Data**: Field notes, behavioral observations
- **Artifacts**: Cultural objects, personal items

## Data Collection Methods

### Individual Interviews

#### Structured Interviews
- **Format**: Pre-determined questions with no deviation permitted
- **Advantages**: Consistency across participants, standardized data
- **Limitations**: Limited flexibility, may miss important emerging themes
- **Best Use**: When specific information is needed across all participants

#### Semi-Structured Interviews
- **Format**: Interview guide with pre-determined questions and potential follow-ups
- **Flexibility**: Allows interviewer to pursue relevant topics that arise
- **Advantages**: Balance of structure and adaptability
- **Best Use**: Most common format for qualitative research

#### Interview Question Development
- **Open-Ended Questions**: Encourage storytelling and detailed responses
- **Avoid Direct, Closed, Factual Questions (DCFQs)**: These limit reflection and depth
- **Follow-Up Probes**: "Can you tell me more about that?" "What was that like for you?"
- **Sequencing**: Move from general to specific, easy to difficult topics

### Focus Groups

#### Structure and Composition
- **Participants**: 4-12 people with shared characteristics or experiences
- **Format**: Semi-structured discussion around specific topics
- **Duration**: Typically 60-90 minutes
- **Facilitator Role**: Guide discussion while allowing natural interaction

#### Advantages
- **Multiple Perspectives**: Gather range of responses in single session
- **Social Interaction**: Observe how participants influence each other
- **Efficiency**: Collect data from multiple participants simultaneously
- **Clarification**: Participants can build on or challenge others' responses

#### Limitations
- **Social Desirability**: Pressure to provide socially acceptable responses
- **Dominant Voices**: Some participants may overshadow others
- **Sensitive Topics**: Not suitable for stigmatizing or highly personal subjects
- **Group Dynamics**: May inhibit honest disclosure

### Observational Methods

#### Participant Observation
- **Immersion**: Researcher spends extended time in natural setting
- **Field Notes**: Detailed documentation of observations
- **Relationship Building**: Developing trust with participants
- **Cultural Understanding**: Learning unspoken rules and norms

#### Non-Participant Observation
- **External Perspective**: Researcher observes without direct participation
- **Structured Observation**: Systematic recording of specific behaviors
- **Unobtrusive Methods**: Minimizing researcher influence on setting

## Three Major Qualitative Methodologies

## 1. Ethnographic Research

### Definition and Purpose

Ethnography presents "a given group's conceptual world, seen and experienced from the inside" (Sobo, 2009, p. 297). It answers the fundamental question: "What's it like to be this person?" or "What's it like to be part of this culture?"

### When to Use Ethnography
- **Cultural Understanding**: When the goal is to understand a specific culture or subculture
- **Insider Perspective**: When you need to explain a group's worldview to outsiders
- **Complex Social Phenomena**: When studying intricate social processes or relationships
- **Design Applications**: When developing interventions or tools for specific populations

### Sampling in Ethnographic Studies

#### Purposive Sampling
- **Criteria-Based Selection**: Participants chosen based on specific characteristics
- **Cultural Representatives**: Individuals who can speak to the cultural experience
- **Diverse Perspectives**: Include various roles, ages, experiences within the culture
- **Key Informants**: Individuals with deep cultural knowledge and willingness to share

#### Sample Size Considerations
- **Quality over Quantity**: Focus on depth rather than representativeness
- **Saturation Principle**: Continue until no new cultural insights emerge
- **Practical Constraints**: Consider time, resources, and access limitations

### Ethnographic Design Elements

## 2. Grounded Theory Research

### Definition and Purpose

Grounded theory is "grounded" in its data through an inductive approach that collects data while simultaneously analyzing it and using emerging theory to inform ongoing data collection. This methodology develops theoretical models from empirical data rather than testing pre-existing theories.

### When to Use Grounded Theory
- **Theory Development**: When no existing hypothesis or theory exists to test

- **Purposeful Selection**: Choose participants who can inform emerging concepts
- **Comparative Analysis**: Select cases that provide contrasts and comparisons
- **Saturation Focus**: Continue sampling until categories are fully developed

#### Sample Size Determination
- **Saturation Principle**: Stop when no new information emerges
- **Typical Range**: 12-20 participants for most studies
- **Category Development**: Ensure sufficient data for each theoretical category
- **Theoretical Adequacy**: Sample must support robust theory development

### Grounded Theory Design

#### Iterative Process

**Example**:
```
Participant: "I'm putting his life more in God's hands than I ever was before."
Code: "Putting his life more in God's hands"
```

##### 2. Focused Coding (Axial Coding)
- **Category Development**: Combine most significant codes
- **Relationship Identification**: Understand how categories relate
- **Dimensional Analysis**: Explore properties and dimensions of categories
- **Core Category**: Identify central phenomenon

##### 3. Theoretical Coding
