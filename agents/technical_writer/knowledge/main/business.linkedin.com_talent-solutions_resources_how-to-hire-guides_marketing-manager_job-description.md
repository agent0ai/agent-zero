## How to write a marketing manager job description

With the current talent shortage making it increasingly challenging to find skilled workers in certain industries and roles, it’s more important than ever to write a job description that stands out from the rest. That’s why you need to create a marketing manager posting that is concise, goal-oriented, and also inspirational. Help people understand the expectations of this role — and reveal how the candidates will have an impact.  

 If you really want to get a competitive edge, be sure to highlight what makes your company unique, including the perks. According to a survey by ManpowerGroup, almost a third (32%) of organizations are offering more perks to overcome shortages in talent, including things like tuition reimbursements, egg-freezing assistance programs, and even pet insurance.
