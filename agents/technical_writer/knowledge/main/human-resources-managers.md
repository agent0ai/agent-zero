## What Human Resources Managers Do [About this section](#TB_inline?height=325&width=325&inlineId=about-what-they-do)

![Human resources managers](/ooh/images/1618.jpg)

Human resources managers often coordinate the work of a team of specialists.

Human resources managers plan, coordinate, and direct the administrative functions of an organization. They oversee the recruiting, interviewing, and hiring of new staff; consult with top executives on strategic planning; and serve as a link between an organization’s management and its employees.

### Duties

Human resources managers typically do the following:

* Plan and coordinate an organization’s workforce to best use employees’ talents
* Link an organization’s management with its employees
* Plan and oversee employee benefit programs
* Serve as a consultant to advise other managers on human resources issues, such as equal employment opportunity and sexual harassment
* Coordinate and supervise the work of specialists and support staff
* Oversee an organization’s recruitment, interview, selection, and hiring processes
* Handle staffing issues, such as mediating disputes and directing disciplinary procedures

Organizations want to attract, motivate, and keep qualified employees and match them to jobs for which they are well-suited. Human resources managers accomplish this aim by directing the administrative functions of human resources departments. Their work involves overseeing employee relations, securing regulatory compliance, and administering employee-related services such as payroll, training, and benefits. They supervise the department’s specialists and support staff and make sure that tasks are completed accurately and on time.

Human resources managers also consult with [top executives](/ooh/management/top-executives.htm "Top Executives") regarding strategic planning and talent management. They identify ways to maximize the value of the organization’s employees and ensure that they are used efficiently. For example, they might assess worker productivity and recommend changes to help the organization meet budgetary goals.

Some human resources managers oversee all aspects of an organization’s human resources department, including the compensation and benefits program and the training and development program. In many larger organizations, these programs are directed by specialized managers, such as [compensation and benefits managers](/ooh/management/compensation-and-benefits-managers.htm "Compensation and Benefits Managers") and [training and development managers](/ooh/management/training-and-development-managers.htm "Training and Development Managers").

The following are examples of types of human resources managers:

***Labor relations directors***, also called ***employee relations managers***, oversee employment policies in union and nonunion settings. They negotiate, draft, and administer labor contracts that cover issues such as wages, benefits, and union and management practices. They also handle labor complaints between employees and management, and they coordinate grievance procedures.

***Payroll managers*** supervise an organization’s payroll department. They ensure that all aspects of payroll are processed correctly and on time. They administer payroll procedures, prepare reports for the accounting department, and resolve payroll problems.

***Recruiting managers***, sometimes called ***staffing managers***, oversee the recruiting and hiring responsibilities of the human resources department. They often supervise a team of recruiters, and some take on recruiting duties for filling high-level positions. They must develop a recruiting strategy that helps them meet the staffing needs of their organization and compete effectively to attract the best employees.

## How to Become a Human Resources Manager [About this section](#TB_inline?height=325&width=325&inlineId=about-become-one)

![Human resources managers](/ooh/images/1620.jpg)

Human resources managers typically need a combination of a bachelor's degree and work experience.

Candidates typically need a combination of education and several years of related work experience to become a human resources manager. Although most positions require a bachelor’s degree, some require a master’s degree.

### Education

Human resources managers typically need a bachelor’s degree to enter the occupation. The degree may be in human resources or another [field](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/field-of-degree/home.htm), such as [business](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/field-of-degree/business/business-field-of-degree.htm), [communications](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/field-of-degree/communications/communications-field-of-degree.htm), or [psychology](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/field-of-degree/psychology/psychology-field-of-degree.htm). Courses in subjects such as conflict management may be helpful.

Some jobs may require a master’s degree in human resources, labor relations, or business administration (MBA).

### Work Experience in a Related Occupation

To demonstrate abilities in organizing, directing, and leading others, human resources managers must have related work experience. Some managers start out as [human resources specialists](/ooh/business-and-financial/human-resources-specialists.htm "Human Resources Specialists") or [labor relations specialists](/ooh/business-and-financial/labor-relations-specialists.htm "Labor Relations Specialists").

Management positions typically require an understanding of human resources programs, such as compensation and benefits plans; human resources software; and federal, state, and local employment laws.

### Licenses, Certifications, and Registrations

Although certification is voluntary, it shows professional expertise and credibility, and it may enhance job opportunities. Employers may prefer to hire candidates with certification, and some positions may require it. [The Society for Human Resource Management](https://www.shrm.org/) (SHRM), [HR Certification Institute](https://www.hrci.org/) (HRCI), [WorldatWork](https://worldatwork.org), and [International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans](https://www.ifebp.org/Pages/default.aspx) are among many professional associations that offer certification programs.

### Important Qualities

***Communication skills.*** Human resources managers need strong speaking, writing, and listening skills to give presentations and direct their staff.

***Decision-making skills.*** Human resources managers must be able to balance the strengths and weaknesses of different options and decide the best course of action.

***Interpersonal skills.*** Human resources managers regularly interact with people, such as to collaborate on teams, and must develop working relationships with their colleagues.

***Leadership skills.*** Human resources managers must coordinate work activities and ensure that staff complete the duties and responsibilities of their department.

***Organizational skills*.** Human resources managers must be able to prioritize tasks and manage several projects at once.
