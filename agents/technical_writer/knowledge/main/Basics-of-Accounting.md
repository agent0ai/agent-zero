Introduction to accounting 
Introduction 
• The main objective of every business is to earn profit.  
• At end of each year, every business wants to know how much profit they have earned or losses 
occurred, how much stock they have in their warehouse, how much is business liabilities, how 
much is owed to them and by whom, etc.  
• So many other such questions which a businessman wants to know on a daily, monthly or annual 
basis. 
•  In order to attain such information, it is essential to keep a complete and systematic record of each 
and every business transaction entered into during the year. 
 
 
 
Meaning of accounting 
Accounting is the process of identifying, recording, classifying, summarising, interpreting and 
communicating financial information of business to its users for judgement and decision making. 
 
“Accounting is the art of recording, classifying and summarising in a significant manner and in terms of 
money, transactions and events, which are, in part atleast, of a financial character, and interpreting the 
result thereof.” — American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 
 
Functions of accounting 
 
1. Identifying: Identifying the business transactions of a financial character from the source 
documents such as invoice, agreements, cash memos etc. and measure them in terms of 
money.

2.  Recording: The next function of accounting is to keep a systematic record of all business 
transactions, which are identified in chronological order of their occurrence in the journal or 
subsidiary books.  
3.  Classifying: Classification of the recorded business transactions so as to group the transactions 
of similar type at one place. i.e., in ledger accounts. In order to verify the arithmetical accuracy 
of the accounts, trial balance is prepared.  
4.  Summarising: The classified information available from the trial balance is used to prepare 
profit and loss account and balance sheet in a manner useful to the users of accounting 
information. 
5.  Analysing: It establishes the relationship between the items of the profit and loss account and 
the balance sheet. The purpose of analysing is to identify the financial strength and weakness 
of the business. It provides the basis for interpretation.  
6.  Interpreting: It is concerned with explaining the meaning and significance of the relationship 
so established by the analysis. Interpretation should be useful to the users, so as to enable 
them to take correct decisions.  
7.  Communicating: The results obtained from the summarised, analysed and interpreted 
information are communicated to the interested parties. 
 
Accounting Cycle 
The accounting cycle is the holistic process of recording and processing all financial transactions of a 
company, from when the transaction occurs, to its representation on the financial statements, to closing 
the accounts. One of the main duties of a bookkeeper is to keep track of the full accounting cycle from 
start to finish. The cycle goes on continued till the business ends.

1. Transactions- the first task of accounting is to identify the transactions of financial 
character and measure them in terms of money. Transactions may include a debt payoff, 
any purchases or acquisition of assets, sales revenue, or any expenses incurred. 
2.  Journal Entries- With the transactions set in place, the next step is to record these 
entries in the company’s journal in chronological order. In debiting one or more 
accounts and crediting one or more accounts, the debits and credits must always 
balance. 
3.  Posting to the General Ledger (GL) -The journal entries are then posted to the general 
ledger where a summary of all transactions to individual accounts can be seen. 
4. Trial Balance - At the end of the accounting period (which may be quarterly, monthly, or 
yearly, depending on the company), a total balance is calculated for the accounts. 
5.  Financial Statements- The balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement 
can be prepared using the correct balances. 
 
Book-keeping, accounting and accountancy 
 
 
 
Book-Keeping – Book-keeping is recording the business transaction of monetary aspects in books of 
accounts. It is mainly concerned with record keeping or maintenance of books of accounts. It 
includes identifying, measuring, recording and classifying functions of accounting. The book-keeping 
function is routine and clerical in nature and can be performed by a person having limited knowledge 
of accounting.  
 
Accounting - Accounting is considered as a system which collects and processes financial information 
of a business. Accounting starts where bookkeeping ends. It includes summarising, analysing, 
interpreting and communicating functions of accounting.

Objectives of accounting 
The following are the main objectives or utility of accounting: 
 
1. Keep systematic record of business transaction- The main objective of accounting is to keep 
complete record of business transactions according to specified rules. Complete record of business 
transactions helps to avoid the possibility of omission and frauds. For this purpose, all the business 
transactions are first of all recorded in journal or subsidiary books and then posted into ledger. 
 
2.  Calculate profit or loss – The second main objective of accounting is to ascertain the net profit 
earned on loss suffered on account of business transactions during a particular period. For this 
purpose trading and profit & loss account of the business is prepared at the end of each accounting 
period. 
 
3.  To ascertain the financial position of the business - After preparing the profit & loss account a 
statement called balance sheet is prepared which shows the assets and their values on one hand 
and liabilities and capital on the other. A balance sheet is actually a screen picture of financial 
position of the business. 
 
4. To provide information to various parties- The objective of the accounting is to communicate the 
accounting information to various interested parties like owners, creditors, banks, government etc.

Sub-disciplines within accounting 
Financial accounting 
Financial accounting assists in keeping a systematic record of financial transactions, the preparation and 
presentation of financial reports in order to arrive at a measure of organisational success and financial 
soundness. The financial accounting is useful for ascertaining profit or loss made for a given period and 
financial position at the end of the given period and also the sources and uses of cash for the given period. 
 
Cost accounting 
Cost accounting assists in analysing the expenditure for ascertaining the cost of various products 
manufactured or services rendered by the firm. It also helps in controlling the costs and providing 
necessary costing information to management for decision-making. 
 
Management accounting 
Management accounting draws the relevant information mainly from financial accounting and cost 
accounting which helps the management in budgeting, assessing profitability, taking pricing decisions, 
capital expenditure decisions and so on. 
 
 
Accounting is an art as well as science  
Accounting, like science follows a systematic and organized path to understand the economic status of an 
entity.  
 
Science is obtaining knowledge by a systematic pattern including observation, study, practice, experiments 
and investigation. Like Science, Accounting requires gaining knowledge about the economic status of an 
entity by systematic study. An accountant finalizes the economic results by identifying, analyzing, 
classifying using the method of double entry book-keeping system.  
 
So, Accounting is a science that comprises of rules, principles, concepts, conventions and standards in 
science.  
 
Art is the application of techniques and methods. Accounting is an art because it presents the financial 
findings by following and implementing universally accepted principles (GAAP). 
  
Art is the study of application of scientific method to practical use. Accounting is an art as the established 
rules and principles of accounting are applied to bookkeeping process of an economic entity.

Advantages of accounting 
 
 
 
• Protecting business assets  
• Facilitates settlement of tax liabilities: A systematic accounting record immensely helps settlement 
of taxes as it is good evidence of the correctness of transactions.  
• Replaces memory: A systematic and timely recording of transactions obviates the necessity to 
remember the transactions. The accounting record provides the necessary information.  
• Facilitates comparative study: A systematic record enables a businessman to compare one year’s 
results with those of other years and locate significant factors leading to the change, if any.  
• Facilitates loans: Loan is granted by the banks and financial institutions on the basis of growth 
potential which is supported by the performance. Accounting makes the information available with 
respect to performance.  
• Facilitates sale of business: If someone desires to sell his business, the accounts maintained by him 
will enable the ascertainment of the proper purchase price.  
 
 
Disadvantages of accounting 
 
 
 
• Accounting ignores the qualitative element: Since accounting is confined to monetary matters 
only, qualitative elements like the quality of staff, industrial relations and public relations are 
ignored.

[Type here] 
 
pg. 8 
 
• Accounting may lead to window dressing: The term window dressing means manipulation of 
accounts in a way so as to conceal vital facts and present the financial statements in a way to show 
a better position than what it is actually.  
• Accounting is based on historical costs: Accounting often uses historical costs to measure the 
values. This fails to take into consideration factors such as inflation, price changes, etc. This skews 
the relevance of such accounting records and information. This is one of the major limitations of 
accounting.  
• Accounting is not fully exact: Although most of the transactions are recorded on the basis of 
evidence such as sale or purchase or receipt of cash, yet some estimates are also made for 
ascertaining profit or loss. Examples of this are providing depreciation on the basis of the estimated 
useful life of an asset, possible bad debts, the probable market price of the stock of goods, etc.  
 
 
 
Types of Accounting Information 
 
 
Information relating to profit or surplus: The income statement i.e., profit and loss account makes 
available the accounting information about the profit earned or loss incurred as a result of business 
operations or otherwise during an accounting period.  
 
Information relating to financial position: The position statement, i.e., the balance sheet makes the 
information available about the financial position of the entity.  
In the case of not-for-profit organisation, the difference between assets and liabilities is termed as ‘General 
Fund.’  
 
Information about cash flow: Cash flow statement is a statement that shows flow, both inflow and 
outflow, of cash during a specific period. It is of immense use as many decisions such as payment of 
liabilities, payment of dividend and expansion of business etc., are based on the availability of cash.

Basic accounting terms 
 
Capital: refers to the amount invested by the proprietor in a business enterprise.  
Capital is also known as – Owner’s Equity /Net Worth/ Net Assets 
 
Assets = Liability + Capital 
 
 
Drawings: any cash or value of goods withdrawn by the owner for personal use or any private payments 
made out of business funds.  
 
Liabilities: It refers to the amount which the firm owes to outsiders.  
Example: Unpaid wages, Creditors, etc. 
 
Classification of liabilities

Also classified as:  
- Non- current liabilities (to be paid after more than 1 year)  
- Current liabilities (to be paid within 1 year)  
 
Case Study: Mr. X invests Rs.10000 in his business and takes a loan of Rs.25,000 from SBI Bank for a period 
of 10 years. Then he buys goods worth Rs.2000 from Mr. Y on credit for 2 months.

Distinction between business transaction and event  
 
A Business Transaction is an economic activity of the business that changes its financial position.  
(The change should be capable of being expressed in terms of money)  
 
An event is the result of a transaction.  
 
Example:  
Ram purchased goods worth Rs.2 lacs and sold them for Rs.2.5 lacs. Thus, he earned a profit of Rs.50 
thousand.  
Transactions - Economic activity of purchasing goods, selling goods.  
Event - Profit of Rs 50,000 earned due to the transactions taking place.

Accounting principles 
BASIC ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES  
Accounting Principles - Financial statements are the product of a process in which a large volume of data 
about aspects of the economic activities of an enterprise are accumulated, analysed and reported. This 
process should be carried out in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These principles 
represent the most current consensus about how accounting information should be recorded, what 
information should be disclosed, how it should be disclosed, and which financial statement should be 
prepared. The general acceptance of an accounting principle usually depends on its usefulness, 
objectiveness and feasibility. 
 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)  
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are basic accounting principles and guidelines which 
provide the framework for more detailed and comprehensive accounting rules, standards and other 
industry-specific accounting practices. 
 
 
 
Separate Business Entity Concept - In accounting we make a distinction between business and the owner. 
All the books of accounts records day to day financial transactions from the view point of the business 
rather than from that of the owner.  
For instance, when a person invests Rs. 1 lakh into a business, it will be treated that the business has 
borrowed that much money from the owner and it will be shown as a ‘capital’ in the books of accounts of 
business.  
Similarly, if the owner withdraws some amount from the business, then it is shown as drawings in the 
books of accounts of business.

Money Measurement Concept - In accounting, only those business transactions are recorded which can be 
expressed in terms of money. In other words, a fact or transaction or happening which cannot be 
expressed in terms of money is not recorded in the accounting books.  
This concept imposes two limitations: 
 
 
 
 
Dual Aspect Concept - Financial accounting records all the transactions and events involving financial 
element. Each of such transactions requires two aspects to be recorded. The recognition of these two 
aspects of every transaction is known as a dual aspect analysis. According to this concept every business 
transaction has dual effect. 
 
 
 
 
Going Concern Concept - The business entity is assumed to be a going concern, i.e., it will continue to 
operate for an indefinite amount of time. This assumption is important because if the business entity were 
to liquidate in the near future, it would have to restate its assets and liabilities in the accordance with the 
actual amount that could be realised or payable as the case may be so as to reflect the true financial 
position of the entity.  
 
 
Accounting Period Concept - This concept requires that the life of the business should be divided into 
appropriate segments for studying the financial results shown by the enterprise after each segment. A year 
is the most common interval on account of prevailing practice, tradition and government requirements. 
Some firms adopt financial year of the government, some other calendar year. 
 
 
Historical Cost Concept - According to this concept an asset is ordinarily entered on the accounting records 
at the price paid to acquire it. 
 
 
The cost concept does not mean that all assets remain on the accounting records at their original cost for 
all times to come. The asset may systematically be reduced in its value by charging ‘depreciation’.

Managing Director can't be

Use of money implies that we
assume stable or constant
value of rupee
For example, if a firm sells goods of Rs. 10,000 this transaction involves two aspects.

One aspect is the delivery of goods and the other aspect is immediate receipt of cash
(in the case of cash sales).
For example, if a business buys a plant for Rs. 5 lakh the asset would be recorded in

the books at Rs. 5 lakh, even if its market value at that time happens to be Rs. 6 lakh.
[Type here] 
 
pg. 15 
 
Matching Concept - This concept requires the revenue for a particular period to be matched with its 
corresponding expenditure so as to show the true profit for the period.  
This means that if you owned a store and spent money to purchase items for your inventory, you wouldn't 
record that expense until you sold the items for revenue.  
 
Accrual Concept - Accrual concept is the most fundamental principle of accounting which requires 
recording revenues when they are earned and not when they are received in cash and recording expenses 
when they are incurred and not when they are paid. 
 
 
 
 
Difference between accounting concepts and conventions 
 
Accounting concept 
Accounting convention 
Accounting concepts refers to the rules of 
accounting which are to be followed, while 
recording business transactions and preparing final 
accounts.  
Accounting conventions implies the customs or 
practices that are widely accepted by the 
accounting bodies and are adopted by the firm to 
work as a guide in the preparation of final 
accounts.  
 
 
Materiality Convention – Materiality concept states that items of small significance need not be given 
strict theoretically correct treatment. 
 
 
 
Conservatism Convention - All anticipated expenses or losses will need to be accounted for but all 
potential income or gains should not be recorded until actually earned/received.

Example - A business records its utility bills as soon as it receives them and not when

they are paid, because the service has already been used. The company ignores the
date when the payment will be made.
For example, an ordinary calculator costing Rs. 100 may last for ten years.
However, the effort involved in allocating its cost over the ten year period is not
worth the benefit that can be derived from this operation. The cost incurred on
calculator may be treated as the expense of the period in which it is purchased. It
should be noted that an item material for one party may be immaterial for another.
It is a matter of judgement and common sense.
Examples include - ‘Valuing the stock in trade at market price or cost price whichever
is less’ and ‘making the provision for doubtful debts on debtors in anticipation of
actual bad debts’.

Advantages and disadvantages 
 
 
 
 
 
Accounting equation 
Prior to understanding an accounting equation, it is essential to know about a Balance Sheet (in a simple T 
format) 
 
Example to understand the basics of accounting equation  
 
Kapil started a business of shoes. He invested Rs.80 lacs of his own and borrowed Rs.20 lacs from Sunil @ 
7% p.a. From this amount he bought a shop worth Rs40 lacs. He spent on furnishing Rs.10 lacs. He bought 
some stock of shoes worth Rs.30 lacs and balance he deposited in bank.  
The above position can be expressed as: 
 
Cash basis
Advantages 
1. It is very simple as adjustment 
enteries are not required                    
2. This basis of accounting is suitable 
for those enterprises where most of 
the transactions are on cash basis
Disadvantages
1. It does not give a true and fair view 
of the profit or loss abd the financial 
position of an enterprise 
2. It does not follow the matching 
principle of accounting
Accrual basis
Advantages 
1. It shows a complete picture of 
financial transactions of the business 
2. It discloses correct profit or loss 
and also exhibits true financial 
position of an enterprise
Disadvantages 
1. It is not as simple as cash basis 
2. A quick appraisal of the profit/loss 
is not possible

Meaning 
 
Accounting Equation signifies that the assets of a business are always equal to the total of capital and 
liabilities. 
 
 
 
A business transaction will result in the change in either of the total assets, liabilities or capital of the firm 
and even after the change the assets will be again equal to the total of capital and liabilities.  
 
Continuing with the previous examples  
 
Shoes of Rs.5 lacs were sold to a retailer (Ram) on credit.  
 
Assets = Liabilities + Capital

Journal 
Meaning 
 
The books in which transactions are recorded for the first time from a source document are called ‘Book of 
Original Entry’.  
 
Journal is one of the basic books of original entry in which transactions are originally recorded in a 
chronological order according to the principles of double entry system.  
 
After Journal, transactions are entered in Ledger. 
 
 
 
 
 
recording a transaction in a journal is known as journalising  
The various columns of journal are explained in details below:  
 
Date  
This column is used to write the date of the business transaction. Different date formats are used in 
different countries. Different formats of date are: 15.03.2001, 03.15.2011, 15 March 2021 etc.

Particulars or Details Column  
In this column the names of the two connected accounts are written in two consecutive lines - in the first 
line the name of account debited and in the second line the name of account credited.  
 
The world "Dr." is used at the end of the name of account debited. It is not necessary to place the word 
"Cr." after the name of the credited account, because if one account is Dr. It follows that the other account 
must be Cr. 
 
Ledger Folio (L.F)  
In this column, the number of the ledger page is written to which the amount is posted  
 
Amount  
The debit amount is written in the first "amount" column against the name of account debited and the 
credit amount in the second "amount" column against the name of account credited. 
 
 
 
 
Rules for Journalizing  
 
 
How a transaction is recorded in journal, is discussed below:  
Suppose the transaction is:  
Purchased furniture from Mr. A on 10.01.20 for Rs.16,000, for cash  
Here furniture accounting is debited and cash account is credited. 
 
 
 
 
Simple Entry and Compound Entry  
 
Simple entry - Every transaction effect two accounts - one is debited and another account is credited. 
Thus, in recording a transaction in a journal one account is debited and another account is credited. This 
type of entry is called simple entry.

Compound entry - The entry in which more than one account is debited or more than one account is 
credited, is known as compound entry. Three or more accounts are connected with a compound entry.  
 
Example of Simple Entry  
For example, on 10.04.20 we bought furniture from S. The entry is: 
 
 
 
Example of Compound Entry  
For example, on 16.05.20 we paid Rs. 1,000 on account of salaries and Rs.600 on account of rent. For this 
the entry will be: 
 
 
 
Here two accounts have been debited and the entry involves three accounts. Hence, it is a compound 
entry. 
 
Personal Books and Business Books  
It should be noted here that no private transactions of the proprietor can be recorded in the books of 
business. On the other hand, no transactions of the business can be recorded in the books of its proprietor. 
But the transactions in between proprietor and business must be recorded in the books of both the 
proprietor and business. If these rules are not strictly followed, the books of account will fail to disclose the 
true result of business.  
 
We are concerned with the books of business, not with the private books of proprietor. Transactions 
between the business and its proprietor are recorded in the following two accounts: 
 
Capital Account  
The money with which proprietor starts his business is called capital. When proprietor brings capital in the 
business, it is recorded in capital A/C. Capital account is in fact the personal account of the proprietor. So, 
it is a personal account. The proprietor has given the benefit to the business through introduction of 
capital. So, proprietor's account A/C, i.e., capital account will be credited. From the viewpoint of

bookkeeping the introduction of capital to the business by proprietor means that the proprietor lends the 
money to his business and the business becomes indebted to him. The proprietor is regarded as a special 
or internal creditor to the business.  
 
Example: Mr. R started a business with Rs.20,000 
 
 
 
 
Drawings  
 
If the proprietor draws any money or takes goods from his business for his personal use, it will be recorded 
in drawings A/C. Drawings A/C is the personal account of the proprietor, so it is classified as the personal 
account. Proprietor receives benefit when he withdraws money or goods from business. So, the 
proprietor's account i.e., drawing is debited.  
Example: 
 
 
 
 
Entries of some specific transactions  
 
Cash Discount  
The manufacturers and whole sellers frequently grant cash discount to their debtors who will pay their 
debts before due date for goods purchased by them on credit. The seller regards it a "cash discount" or 
"sale discount" or "discount allowed". The buyer calls the discount as "purchase discount" or "discount 
received".  
 
Trade Discount  
This discount is allowed by wholesaler or manufacturer to the retailer at a fixed percentage on the listed 
price of goods. It is allowed when goods are manufactured in bulk. No separate entry is passed for the 
trade discount, as it is deducted from the invoice of the goods.

Opening Entry  
Business firms close their books of accounts at the end of each year and start a new set of books in the 
beginning of each new year. The first entry in journal is to record the closing balances of individual assets 
and liabilities of the previous year. These balances become the opening balances of the new year. The 
entry passed to record the closing balances of the previous year is called the opening entry.  
While passing the opening entry all the assets are debited and capital and liabilities are credited. If capital 
is not given, total liabilities are deducted from total assets. 
 
Example of Journal  
Journalise the following transactions: 2020

Ledger 
The journal provides a complete listing of the daily transactions of a business, but it does not provide 
information about a specific account in one place. For example, to know how much cash balance we have, 
the accounting clerk would have to check all the journal entries in which cash is involved which is very 
difficult. To avoid this difficulty, the debit and credit of journalized transactions are transferred to ledger 
accounts. Thus, all the changes for a single account are located in one place - in a ledger account. This 
makes it easy to determine the current balance of any account.  
 
Standard Form of Ledger Account:  
To understand clearly as to how to write the accounts in ledger, the standard form of an account is given 
below with two separate transactions: 
 
 
 
 
Posting Procedure:  
 
Transferring information i.e., entries from journal to ledger accounts is called posting. The procedure of 
posting from journal to ledger is as follows:  
1. Locate the ledger account from the first debit in the journal entry.  
2. Record the date in the date column on the debit side of the account. The date is the date of transaction 
rather than the date of the posting.  
3. Record the name of the opposite account (account credited in entry) in the particular (also known as 
reference column, description column etc.) column.  
4. Record the page number of the journal in the journal reference (J.R) column from where the entry is 
being posted.  
5. Record the amount of the debit in the "amount column"  
6. Locate the ledger account for the first credit in the journal and follow the same procedure.  
 
 
Balancing An Account:  
 
The difference between the two sides of an account is its balance. The balance is written on the lesser side 
to make the two sides equal. The process of equalizing the two sides of an account is known as balancing.  
The rules for balancing an account are stated as below:  
1. Add up the amount columns of both the sides of an account and write the totals in a separate slip of 
paper.  
2. Find out the difference of the two totals.  
3. Write down the difference on the lesser side of the account.  
4. Now total up both the sides and write the totals and draw double lines under them.  
5. Again write the difference on the opposite side below the double line.

If the debit side of an account is heavier, its balance is known as debit balance. and if the credit side of an 
account is heavier its balance is known as credit balance. If the two sides are equal, that account will show 
zero balance. The rules for determining the balance is as follows: 
 
 
 
It may be noted that at the time of balancing an account debit balance is placed on the credit side and 
credit balance on debit site. This balance is known as closing balance. What is closing balance in this year, 
is the opening balance of the next year. 
 
 
Example:  
Enter the following transactions in journal and post them into ledger: 
 
2018 
Jan. 1  
Mr. Javed started business with cash Rs.100,000  
2  
He purchased furniture for Rs.20,000  
3  
He purchased goods for Rs.60,000  
5  
He sold goods for cash Rs.80,000

2. Real Accounts  
Method of closing the Cash A/c and the accounts of all other assets is the same as that of personal 
accounts. When balanced, these will always show debit balances.  
 
3. Nominal Accounts  
These accounts do not require balancing. As the main purpose of opening such accounts is to ascertain the 
net profit or loss of the firm, all such accounts are transferred to the trading and profit and loss account of 
the firm at the end of the financial period. 
 
 
Subsidiary books 
If the size of business is small, then it is possible to enter every transaction in Journal only, but if the size of 
business is large, it is no longer possible to enter every transaction in one book only. Therefore, Journal is 
divided into sub-parts, known as Special Journals.  
Therefore, following subsidiary books are prepared:

Cash book 
It plays a dual role. It is both a book of original entry as well as a book of final entry. All cash transactions 
are primarily recorded in it as soon as they take place; so, it is a journal (a book of original entry/subsidiary 
book). On the other hand, the cash aspect of all cash transactions is finally recorded in the Cash Book (no 
posting in Ledger); so, a Cash Book is also a Ledger (a book of final entry/Principal Book). 
 
 
 
 
TYPES OF CASH BOOKS  
 
Single Column Cash Book  
The single column cash book records all cash transactions of the business in a chronological order, i.e., it is 
a complete record of cash receipts and cash payments. When all receipts and payments are made in cash 
by a business organisation only, the cash book contains only one amount column on each (debit and credit) 
side.

3. Ledger Folio (L.F.): It records the page number in the ledger where the amount has been posted in the 
account.  
4. Amount: The amounts received are written on the debit side and the amounts paid are written on the 
credit side.  
 
 
Posting in single column cash book  
 
The left side of the cash book shows the receipts of the cash whereas the right side of the cash book shows 
all the payments made in cash. The accounts appearing on then debit side for the cash book are credited in 
the respective ledger accounts because cash has been received in respect of them. Similarly, all the 
account names appearing on the credit side of the cash book are debited as cash/cheque has been paid in 
respect of them.  
 
Balancing of single column cash book  
 
A cash book is balanced like any other account. The receipts column is always bigger than the payments 
column. The difference is written on the credit side as ‘By balance c/d’.

But in Double Column Cash Book, we have two accounts, Cash A/c and the Bank A/c, so it is possible to 
have both a debit entry and a credit entry at the same time. For example, cash of Rs.5,000 is deposited into 
the bank. In this transaction both Bank A/c and Cash A/c are involved and they will be recorded on both 
sides of Double Column Cash Book i.e., on the debit side in bank column and on the credit side in cash 
column.  
 
Thus, a transaction in which Cash A/c and Bank A/c are involved, is recorded on both the sides of Double 
Column Cash Book, it is called "contra entry".  
 
In recording such a transaction, the letter "C", is written in 'L.F.' column because both aspects of the 
transactions are recorded and there is no need to post them into the ledger. 
 
Example  
Enter the following transactions in a double column cash book/two column cash book.

Petty Cash  
 
It is another Cash Book which is maintained, generally, in large business concerns to reduce the burden of 
'Main Cash Book', in which numerous transactions involving petty (small) amounts are recorded. For this 
purpose, a Petty Cashier is appointed by the Chief Cashier. The Chief Cashier advances a sum of money to 
the Petty Cashier to enable him to meet petty expenses for a fixed period. The Petty Cashier will record 
this amount on the Debit Side of the Petty Cash Book while the Chief Cashier will record the same amount 
on the Credit Side of the Main Cash Book. 
 
 
Imprest system of petty cash book  
 
Under this system, a definite sum, say Rs.2,000 is given to the petty cashier at the beginning of a certain 
period. This amount is called imprest amount. The petty cashier goes on making all small payments out of 
this imprest amount and when he has spent the substantial portion of the imprest amount say Rs.1,780, he 
gets reimbursement of the amount spent from the head cashier. Thus, he again has the full imprest 
amount in the beginning of the next period. The reimbursement may be made on a weekly, fortnightly or 
monthly basis, depending on the frequency of small payments.  
 
The balance of the Petty Cash Book will be shown on the asset side of balance sheet as "Cash in hand" at 
the end of the year.  
 
Example  
 
From the following particulars prepare a Petty Cash Book under Imprest System.  
2018  
Jan. 1. Received from the Chief Cashier as imprest cash Rs.400.  
Jan. 2. Paid Taxi hire Rs.20.  
Jan. 3. Paid postage Rs.28 and stationery Rs.60.  
Jan. 4. Purchased stationery Rs.48.

Trial Balance of …… as on March 31, 2014 
 
 
 
Purpose of Trial Balance  
1. To check the equality of debits and credits - an arithmetical or mathematical test of accuracy.  
2. To help in preparation of final accounts.  
3. To locate errors.  
4. To obtain a summary of ledger accounts.  
 
If the trial balance agrees we may reasonably assume that the books are correct. On the other hand, if it 
does not agree, it indicates that the books are not correct - there are mistakes somewhere. There are 
however, a few types of errors which the trial balance cannot detect. In other words, the trial balance will 
agree in spite of the existence of those errors.  
 
Methods of Preparing Trial Balance  
There are two methods for the preparation of trial balance. These methods are:  
1. Total or gross trial balance  
2. Balance or net trial balance  
 
Total or Gross Trial Balance  
Under this method the two sides of all the ledger accounts are totalled up. The total of debit side and 
credit side of each account is then placed on "debit amount" column and "credit amount" column 
respectively of a list. Finally, the two columns are added separately to see whether they agree of not.  
 
Balance or Net Trial Balance  
Under this method, first of all the balances of all ledger accounts are drawn. Thereafter, the debit 
balances and credit balances are recorded in "debit amount" and "credit amount" column respectively and 
the two columns are added separately to see whether they agree or not.

Errors of Errors of Errors of Compensating
omission le errors
[Type here] 
 
pg. 52 
 
The errors of omission may be committed at the time of recording the transaction in the books of original 
entry or while posting to the ledger. These can be of two types:  
(i) error of complete omission  
(ii) error of partial omission  
 
When a transaction is completely omitted from recording in the books of original record, it is an error of 
complete omission. For example, credit sales to Mohan Rs. 10,000, not entered in the sales book. When 
the recording of transaction is partly omitted from the books, it is an error of partial omission. If in the 
above example, credit sales had been duly recorded in the sales book but the posting from sales book to 
Mohan’s account has not been made, it would be an error of partial omission.  
 
Errors of commission  
These are the errors which are committed due to wrong posting of transactions, wrong totalling or wrong 
balancing of the accounts, wrong casting of the subsidiary books, or wrong recording of amount in the 
books of original entry, etc.  
 
For example: Raj Hans Traders paid Rs.25,000 to Preetpal Traders (a supplier of goods). This transaction 
was correctly recorded in the cashbook. But while posting to the ledger, Preetpal’s account was debited 
with Rs.2,500 only. This constitutes an error of commission.  
 
Such an error by definition is of clerical nature and most of the errors of commission affect in the trial 
balance.  
 
Errors of principle  
Accounting entries are recorded as per the generally accepted accounting principles. If any of these 
principles are violated or ignored, errors resulting from such violation are known as errors of principle.  
 
An error of principle may occur due to incorrect classification of expenditure or receipt between capital 
and revenue.  
 
Examples:  
• Amount spent on additions to the buildings should be treated as capital expenditure and must be 
debited to the asset account. Instead, if this amount is debited to maintenance and repairs account, 
it has been treated as a revenue expense. This is an error of principle.  
• If a credit purchase of machinery is recorded in purchases book instead of journal proper or rent 
paid to the landlord is recorded in the cash book as payment to landlord, these errors of principle. 
These errors do not affect the trial balance.  
 
 
Compensating errors  
When two or more errors are committed in such a way that the net effect of these errors on the debits and 
credits of accounts is nil, such errors are called compensating errors.  
 
Example: Shyam’s account was debited with Rs.100 instead of Rs.1000 while Ram’s account was debited 
with Rs.1000 instead of Rs.100. Thus, Shyam’s account which was debited by Rs.900 less was compensated 
by another error in Ram’s account, whose account was debited excess of Rs.900.

From another point of view, errors may be divided into two categories:  
 
Errors affecting Trial Balance  
 
1. Posting only one aspect of the journal entry in the ledger  
2. Posting a journal entry on the wrong side of an account  
3. Wrong totalling of the subsidiary books  
4. Posting the correct amount in one account and wrong amount in another account  
5. Wrong totalling or balancing of the ledger account  
6. Omission in writing the balance of an account in the trial balance  
7. Writing balance in the wrong column of trial balance  
8. Totalling the trial balance wrongly  
 
Errors not affecting Trial Balance  
 
1. Errors of complete omission  
Transaction remains altogether unrecorded either in Journal or in Subsidiary books.  
 
2. Compensating Errors  
Effect of one error is neutralized by the effect of some other error. 
 
 
3. Errors of Principle  
Some fundamental principle of accounting is violated while recording a transaction.  
Suppose on the purchase of a typewriter, office expenses account is debited, the trial balance will still 
agree  
 
4. Errors of Posting in wrong account  
While posting from the books of original entry, posting is made to a wrong account but on the correct side.  
 
5. Recording both the aspects of a transaction twice in the books of accounts  
 
Case study (for errors)  
Mr. Roy is a furniture dealer. Some of the transactions undertaken through the year are as follows:

From the point of view of rectification, the errors may be classified into the following two categories:  
 
(a) errors which do not affect the trial balance.  
 
(b) errors which affect the trial balance.  
 
Rectification of errors which do not affect the trial balance (Two sided errors)  
 
These errors are committed in two or more accounts. Such errors are also known as two sided errors. They 
can be rectified by recording a journal entry giving the correct debit and credit to the concerned accounts.

Examples of such errors are – complete omission to record an entry in the books of original entry; wrong 
recording of transactions in the book of accounts; complete omission of posting to the wrong account on 
the correct side, and errors of principle.  
 
Such errors are rectified by passing a rectifying entry.  
 
The procedure for rectification for such errors is explained with the help of following examples:  
 
(a) Credit sales to Mohan Rs. 10,000 were not recorded in the sales book. This is an error of complete 
omission. Its affect is that Mohan’s account has not been debited and Sales account has not been credited. 
Accordingly, recording usual entry for credit sales will rectify the error.

(b) Credit sales to Mohan Rs. 10,000 were recorded as Rs. 1,000 in the sales book. This is an error of 
commission.  
 
 
 
 
(c) Credit sales to Mohan Rs.10,000 were recorded as Rs. 12,000. This is an error of commission.

Rectification of errors affecting trial balance (one sided errors)  
 
The errors which affect only one account can be rectified by giving an explanatory note in the account 
affected or by recording a journal entry with the help of the Suspense Account. 
 
 
Rectification of errors before preparation of the trial balance  
 
If the one-sided errors come into notice before preparing the trial balance, they should be rectified by 
debiting the concerned account for short debit or excess credit and by crediting the concerned account for 
short credit or excess debit.  
 
Examples:  
 
Shyam’s account was credited short by Rs.190. This will be rectified by an additional entry for Rs.190 on 
the credit side of his account as follows:

Rectification of errors after preparation of trial balance  
 
One sided errors will be rectified by passing the journal entry either debiting or crediting the suspense 
account.  
 
Suspense account  
 
Sometimes, in spite of best efforts some errors are not located and due to which Trial Balance does not 
tally. In such a situation, to avoid delay in preparing the Final Accounts, the difference in the Trial Balance 
is placed to a newly opened account known as ‘Suspense Account’ and the Trial Balance tallies.  
 
Later, when errors are detected, rectification entries are passed. When all the errors are rectified, the 
account will close.  
 
But if suspense account shows balance, it will be shown on the Asset side of the Balance sheet if it has 
debit balance and if it has credit balance, then it is shown on Liabilities side.  
 
Examples  
 
1) Credit sales to Mohan Rs.10,000 were not posted to his account. This is an error of partial omission 
committed while posting entries of the sales book.

Calculation of Cost of Goods Sold:  
 
Cost of Goods Sold = Opening stock + Net Purchases + Direct Expenses – Closing stock  
 
Cost of Goods Sold = Sales – Gross Profit

Cost of Goods Sold Rs.1,00,000  
Gross Profit 20% on Sales  
 
Solution: Sales will be 1,00,000 × (100/80) = Rs.1,25,000  
Gross Profit = Sales – Cost of Goods Sold  
= Rs.1,25,000 – Rs.1,00,000  
= Rs.25,000

Balance sheet  
 
A Balance Sheet is a statement at a particular date showing on one side the trader’s property and 
possessions and on the other hand the liabilities.  
 
Balance sheet contains all the Assets and Liabilities to show the exact financial position of the business. It is 
known as Balance Sheet because it shows the balances of ledger accounts which are left open after 
transferring all the nominal accounts to Trading & Profit & loss Account. Balances of all the Real and 
Personal Accounts are grouped together and shown in Balance Sheet as Assets and Liabilities.  
 
Marshalling of Assets and Liabilities in Balance Sheet  
 
The assets and liabilities must be shown in such a manner that the financial position of the business can be 
assessed through it easily and quickly. Thus, an arrangement is made in which assets and liabilities are 
shown in the balance sheet. Such an arrangement is called marshalling of assets and liabilities. There are 
three methods of marshalling:  
 
1. Permanency Preference Method  
 
2. Liquidity Preference Method  
 
Permanency Preference Method

Under this method, the assets and liabilities are shown in balance sheet in the order of their permanence. 
In other words, the more permanent the assets and liabilities, the earlier they are shown. 
 
 
 
 
Liquidity Preference Method  
 
Under this method, assets and liabilities are shown in order of their liquidity. The more liquid the assets, 
the earlier are they shown.
