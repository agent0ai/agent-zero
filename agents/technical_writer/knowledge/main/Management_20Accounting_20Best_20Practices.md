Preface

 

The typical accountant receives a thorough grounding in accounting standards in
school, but then arrives on the job and asks—What do I do now? The unfortunate
realization strikes that only a small proportion of the accounting job involves that
painfully acquired knowledge of accounting standards. Instead, many other quest-
ions arise, with no obvious answers:

e How do I create a budget?

e What is a bottleneck asset, and should I invest in it?
e Should I approve a request for a capital expenditure?
e How do I grant credit to customers?

e How do J accelerate cash collections?

e Which controls should I set up?

e How do I conduct a throughput analysis?

e Should we outsource work?

e How do I collect payroll information?

e How do I achieve accurate inventory records?

e How do [allocate costs?

e What kinds of responsibility reports should I use?

e Should! set up a target costing system to assist the development of a new product?

 

e How do I set product prices?
e Where do I place quality review stations to improve profitability?

Management Accounting Best Practices provides the answers to all of these ques-
tions (and over 100 more) that show both the aspiring and seasoned accountant how to
set up and manage an accounting department. Furthermore, when other members of
the management team come calling with questions, the answers now lie on the ac-
countant’s bookshelf.

The information in this book is culled from eight of the author’s best-selling
books: Accounting Control Best Practices, Billing and Collections Best Practices,
Cost Accounting, Financial Analysis, Inventory Accounting, Payroll Best Practices,
Throughput Accounting, and the Ultimate Accountants’ Reference. The new
question-and-answer format in which this information is presented makes it easier
to locate information on key accounting topics, and should make Management Ac-
counting Best Practices a well-thumbed addition to any accountant’s library.

Budgeting Decisions

The most common method for creating a budget is to simply print out the financial
statements, adjust historical expenses for inflationary increases, add some projected
revenue adjustments, and voi/a—instant budget. Unfortunately, this rough method
ignores a massive number of interlocking factors that would probably have resulted in
a very different budget. Without a carefully compiled budget, there is a strong chance
that a company will find itself acting on budget assumptions that are so incorrect that it
may find itself in serious financial straits in short order.

To avoid these problems, the accountant must determine the proper format of a
budget, find the best way to adjust it when revenue volumes change, ensure that the
budgeting process is efficient, factor bottleneck operations into the budget, and use it to
improve company control systems. This chapter provides answers to all of these key
questions. The following table itemizes the section number in which the answers to each
question can be found:

1-1 HOW DOES THE SYSTEM OF INTERLOCKING
BUDGETS WORK?

 

A properly designed budget is a complex web of spreadsheets that account for the
activities of virtually all areas within a company. As noted in Exhibit 1.1, the budget
begins in two places, with both the revenue budget and research and development
(R&D) budget. The revenue budget contains the revenue figures that the company
believes it can achieve for each upcoming reporting period. These estimates come
partially from the sales staff, which is responsible for estimates of sales levels for
existing products within their current territories. Estimates for the sales of new products
that have not yet been released, and for existing products in new markets, will come
from a combination of the sales and marketing staffs, who will use their experience
with related product sales to derive estimates. The greatest fallacy in any budget is to
impose a revenue budget from the top management level without any input from the

sales staff, since this can result in a company wide budget that is geared toward a sales
level that is most unlikely to be reached.

A revenue budget requires prior consideration of a number of issues. For example,
a general market share target will drive several other items within the budget, since
greater market share may come at the cost of lower unit prices or higher credit costs.
Another issue is the compensation strategy for the sales staff, since a shift to higher or
lower commissions for specific products or regions will be a strong incentive for the
sales staff to alter their selling behavior, resulting in some changes in estimated sales
levels. Yet another consideration is which sales territories are to be entered during the
budget period—those with high target populations may yield very high sales per hour
of sales effort, while the reverse will be true if the remaining untapped regions have
smaller target populations. It is also necessary to review the price points that will be
offered during the budget period, especially in relation to the pricing strategies that
are anticipated from competitors. If there is a strategy to increase market share as well
as to raise unit prices, then the budget may fail due to conflicting activities. Another
major factor is the terms of sale, which can be extended, along with easy credit, to
attract more marginal customers; conversely, they can be retracted in order to reduce
credit costs and focus company resources on a few key customers. A final point is that
the budget should address any changes in the type of customer to whom sales will be
made. If an entirely new type of customer will be added to the range of sales targets
during the budget period, then the revenue budget should reflect a gradual ramp-up
that will be required for the sales staff to work through the sales cycle of the new
customers.

Once all of these factors have been ruminated upon and combined to create a
preliminary budget, the sales staff should also compare the budgeted sales level per
person to the actual sales level that has been experienced in the recent past to see if the
company has the existing capability to make the budgeted sales. If not, the revenue
budget should be ramped up to reflect the time it will take to hire and train additional
sales staff. The same cross-check can be conducted for the amount of sales budgeted
per customer, to see if historical experience validates the sales levels noted in the new
budget.

Another budget that initiates other activities within the system of budgets is the
research and development budget. This is not related to the sales level at all (as
opposed to most other budgets), but instead is a discretionary budget that is based on
the company’s strategy to derive new or improved products. The decision to fund a
certain amount of project-related activity in this area will drive a departmental staffing
and capital budget that is, for the most part, completely unrelated to the activity
conducted by the rest of the company. However, there can be a feedback loop between
this budget and the cash budget, since financing limitations may require management
to prune some projects from this area. If so, the management team must work with the
R&D manager to determine the correct mix of projects with both short-range and
long-range payoffs that will still be funded.

The production budget is largely driven by the sales estimates contained within
the revenue budget. However, it is also driven by the inventory-level assumptions in


4 Management Accounting Best Practices

the inventory budget. The inventory budget contains estimates by the materials
management supervisor regarding the inventory levels that will be required for the
upcoming budget period. For example, a new goal may be to reduce the level of finished
goods inventory from 10 turns per year to15. If so, some of the products required by the
revenue budget can be bled off from the existing finished goods inventory stock,
yielding smaller production requirements during the budget period. Alternatively, if
there is a strong focus on improving the level of customer service, then it may be
necessary to keep more finished goods in stock, which will require more production
than is strictly called for by the revenue budget. This concept can also be extended to
work-in-process (WIP) inventory, where the installation of advanced production
planning systems, such as manufacturing resources planning or just-in-time, can be
used to reduce the level of required inventory. Also, just-in-time purchasing techniques
can be used to reduce the amount of raw materials inventory that is kept on hand. All of
these assumptions should be clearly delineated in the inventory budget, so that the man-
agement team is clear about what systemic changes will be required in order to effect
altered inventory turnover levels. Also, be aware that any advanced production plann-
ing system takes a considerable amount of time to install and tune, so it is best if the
inventory budget contains a gradual ramp-up to different planned levels of inventory.

Given this input from the inventory budget, the production budget is used to derive
the unit quantity of required products that must be manufactured in order to meet
revenue targets for each budget period. This involves a number of interrelated factors,
such as the availability of sufficient capacity for production needs. Of particular
concern should be the amount of capacity at the bottleneck operation. Since this tends
to be the most expensive capital item, it is important to budget a sufficient quantity of
funding to ensure that this operation includes enough equipment to meet the targeted
production goals. If the bottleneck operation involves skilled labor, rather than
equipment, then the human resources staff should be consulted regarding its ability
to bring in the necessary personnel in time to improve the bottleneck capacity in a
timely manner.

Another factor that drives the budgeted costs contained within the production
budget is the anticipated size of production batches. If the batch size is expected to
decrease, then more overhead costs should be budgeted in the production scheduling,
materials handling, and machine setup staffing areas. If longer batch sizes are planned
then there may be a possibility of proportionally reducing overhead costs in these
areas. This is a key consideration that is frequently overlooked, but which can have an
outsized impact on overhead costs. If management attempts to contain overhead costs
in this area while still using smaller batch sizes, then it will likely run into larger scrap
quantities and quality issues that are caused by rushed batch setups and the allocation
of incorrect materials to production jobs.

Step costing is also an important consideration when creating the production
budget. Costs will increase in large increments when certain capacity levels are
reached. The management team should be fully aware of when these capacity levels
will be reached, so that it can plan appropriately for the incurrence of added costs. For
example, the addition of a second shift to the production area will call for added costs


1-1 How Does the System of Interlocking Budgets Work? 5

in the areas of supervisory staff, an increased pay rate, and higher maintenance costs.
The inverse of this condition can also occur, where step costs can decline suddenly if
capacity levels fall below a specific point.

Production levels may also be impacted by any lengthy tooling setups or change-
overs to replacement equipment. These changes may halt all production for extended
periods, and so must be carefully planned for. This is the responsibility of the
industrial engineering staff. The accountant would do well to review the company’s
past history of actual equipment setup times to see whether the current engineering
estimates are sufficiently lengthy.

The expense items included in the production budget should be driven by a set of
subsidiary budgets, which are the purchasing, direct labor, and overhead budgets.
These budgets can be simply included in the production budget, but they typically
involve such a large proportion of company costs that it is best to lay them out
separately in greater detail in separate budgets. Comments on these budgets are as
follows:

¢ Purchasing budget. The purchasing budget is driven by several factors, first of
which is the bill of materials that comprises the products that are planned for
production during the budget period. These bills must be accurate, or else the
purchasing budget can include seriously incorrect information. In addition, there
should be a plan for controlling material costs, perhaps through the use of
concentrated buying through few suppliers, or perhaps through the use of long-
term contracts. If materials are highly subject to market pressures, comprise a
large proportion of total product costs, and have a history of sharp price swings,
then best-case and worst-case costing scenarios should be added to the budget so
that managers can review the impact of costing issues in this area. If a just-in-time
delivery system from suppliers is contemplated, then the purchasing budget
should reflect a possible increase in material costs caused by the increased
number of deliveries from suppliers. It is also worthwhile to budget for a raw
material scrap and obsolescence expense; there should be a history of costs in
these areas that can be extrapolated based on projected purchasing volumes.

¢ Direct labor budget. Do not make the mistake of budgeting for direct labor as a
fully variable cost. The production volume from day to day tends to be relatively
fixed, and requires a set number of direct labor personnel on a continuing basis to
operate production equipment and manually assemble products. Further, the
production manager will realize much greater production efficiencies by holding
onto an experienced production staff, rather than by letting them go as soon as
production volumes make small incremental drops. Accordingly, it is better to
budget based on reality, which is that direct labor personnel are usually retained,
even if there are ongoing fluctuations in the level of production. Thus, direct labor
should be shown in the budget as a fixed cost of production, within certain
production volume parameters.

Also, this budget should describe staffing levels by type of direct labor
position; this is driven by labor routings, which are documents that describe the


Management Accounting Best Practices

exact type and quantity of staffing needed to produce a product. When multiplied
by the unit volumes located in the production budget, this results in an expected
level of staffing by direct labor position. This information is most useful for the
human resources staff, which is responsible for staffing the positions.

The direct labor budget should also account for any contractually mandated
changes in hourly rates, which may be itemized in a union agreement. Such an
agreement may also have restrictions on layoffs, which should be accounted for in
the budget if this will keep labor levels from dropping in proportion with
budgeted reductions in production levels. Such an agreement may also require
that layoffs be conducted in order of seniority, which may force higher-paid
employees into positions that would normally be budgeted for less expensive
laborers. Thus, the presence of a union contract can result in a much more
complex direct labor budget than would normally be the case.

The direct labor budget may also contain features related to changes in the

efficiency of employees, and any resulting changes in pay. For example, one
possible pay arrangement is to pay employees based on a piece rate, which
directly ties their performance to the level of production achieved. If so, this will
probably apply only to portions of the workforce, so the direct labor budget may
involve pay rates based on both piece rates and hourly pay. Another issue is that
any drastic increases in the budgeted level of direct labor personnel will likely
result in some initial declines in labor efficiency, since it takes time for new
employees to learn their tasks. If this is the case, the budget should reflect a low
level of initial efficiency, with a ramp-up over time to higher levels that will result
in greater initial direct labor costs. Finally, efficiency improvements may be
rewarded with staff bonuses from time to time; if so, these bonuses should be
included in the budget.
Overhead budget. The overhead budget can be a simple one to create if there are
no significant changes in production volume from the preceding year, because this
involves a large quantity of static costs that will not vary much over time. Included
in this category are machine maintenance, utilities, supervisory salaries, wages for
the materials management, production scheduling, quality assurance personnel,
facilities maintenance, and depreciation expenses. Under the no-change scenario,
the most likely budgetary alterations will be to machinery or facilities maintenance,
which are dependent on the condition and level of usage of company property.

If there is a significant change in the expected level of production volume,
or if new production lines are to be added, then one should examine this budget
in great detail, for the underlying production volumes may cause a ripple effect
that results in wholesale changes to many areas of the overhead budget. Of
particular concern is the number of overhead-related personnel who must be
either laid off or added when capacity levels reach certain critical points, such
as the addition or subtraction of extra work shifts. Costs also tend to rise
substantially when a facility is operating at very close to 100 percent capacity,
since this tends to call for an inordinate amount of effort to maintain on an
ongoing basis.


1-1 How Does the System of Interlocking Budgets Work? 7

The purchasing, direct labor, and overhead budgets can then be summarized into a
cost-of-goods-sold budget. This budget should incorporate, as a single line item, the
total amount of revenue, so that all manufacturing costs can be deducted from it to
yield a gross profit margin on the same document. This budget is referred to constantly
during the budget creation process, since it tells management whether its budgeting
assumptions are yielding an acceptable gross margin result. Since it is a summary-
level budget for the production side of the budgeting process, this is also a good place
to itemize any production-related statistics, such as the average hourly cost of direct
labor, inventory turnover rates, and the amount of revenue dollars per production
person.

Thus far, we have reviewed the series of budgets that descend in turn from the
revenue budget and then through the production budget. However, there are other
expenses that are unrelated to production. These are categories in a separate set of
budgets. The first is the sales department budget. This includes the expenses that the
sales staff must incur in order to achieve the revenue budget, such as travel and
entertainment, as well as sales training. Of particular concern in this budget is the
amount of budgeted headcount that is required to meet the sales target. It is essential
that the actual sales per salesperson from the most recent completed year of operations
be compared with the same calculation in the budget to ensure that there is a
sufficiently large budget available for an adequate number of sales personnel.
This is a common problem, for companies will make the false assumption that the
existing sales staff can make heroic efforts to wildly exceed its previous-year sales
efforts. Furthermore, the budget must account for a sufficient time period in which
new sales personnel can be trained and form an adequate base of customer contacts to
create a meaningful stream of revenue for the company. In some industries, this
learning curve may be only a few days, but it can be the better part of a year if
considerable technical knowledge is required to make a sale. If the latter situation is
the case, it is likely that the procurement and retention of qualified sales staff is the key
element of success for a company, which makes the sales department budget one of the
most important elements of the entire budget.

The marketing budget is also closely tied to the revenue budget, for it contains all
of the funding required to roll out new products, merchandise them properly, advertise
for them, test new products, and so on. A key issue here is to ensure that the marketing
budget is fully funded to support any increases in sales noted in the revenue budget. It
may be necessary to increase this budget by a disproportionate amount if one is trying
to create a new brand, issue a new product, or distribute an existing product in a new
market. These costs can easily exceed any associated revenues for some time. A
common budgeting problem is not to provide sufficient funding in these instances,
leading to a significant drop in expected revenues.

Another nonproduction budget that is integral to the success of the corporation is
the general and administrative budget. This contains the cost of the corporate
management staff, plus all accounting, finance, and human resources personnel.
Since this is a cost center, the general inclination is to reduce these costs to the bare
minimum. However, in order to do so, there must be a significant investment in


8 Management Accounting Best Practices

technology in order to achieve reductions in the manual labor usually required to
process transactions; thus, there must be some provision in the capital budget for this
area.

There is a feedback loop between the staffing and direct labor budgets and the
general and administrative budget, because the human resources department must
staff itself based on the amount of hiring or layoffs that are anticipated elsewhere in the
company. Similarly, a major change in the revenue volume will alter the budget for
the accounting department, since many of the activities in this area are driven by the
volume of sales transactions. Thus, the general and administrative budget generally
requires a number of iterations in response to changes in many other parts of the
budget.

Though salaries and wages should be listed in each of the departmental
budgets, it is useful to list the total headcount for each position through all budget
periods in a separate staffing budget. By doing so, the human resources staff can
tell when specific positions must be filled, so that they can time their recruiting
efforts most appropriately. This budget also provides good information for the
person responsible for the facilities budget, since he or she can use it to determine
the timing and amount of square footage requirements for office space. Rather than
being a standalone budget, the staffing budget tends to be one whose formulas
are closely intertwined with those of all other departmental budgets, so that a
change in headcount information on this budget will automatically translate into a
change in the salaries expense on other budgets. It is also a good place to store the
average pay rates, overtime percentages, and average benefit costs for all positions.
By centralizing this cost information, the human resources staff can more easily
update budget information. Since salary-related costs tend to comprise the highest
proportion of costs in a company (excluding materials costs), this tends to be a
heavily used budget.

The facilities budget is based on the level of activity that is estimated in many of
the budgets just described. For this reason, it is one of the last budgets to be completed.
This budget is closely linked to the capital budget, since expenditures for additional
facilities will require more maintenance expenses in the facilities budget. This budget
typically contains expense line items for building insurance, maintenance, repairs,
janitorial services, utilities, and the salaries of the maintenance personnel employed in
this function. It is crucial to estimate the need for any upcoming major repairs to
facilities when constructing this budget, since these can greatly amplify the total
budgeted expense.

Another budget that includes input from virtually all areas of a company is the
capital budget. This should comprise either a summary listing of all main fixed asset
categories for which purchases are anticipated, or else a detailed listing of the same
information; the latter case is recommended only if there are comparatively few items
to be purchased. The capital budget is of great importance to the calculation of
corporate financing requirements, since it can involve the expenditure of sums far
beyond those that are normally encountered through daily cash flows. This topic is
addressed in greater detail in Chapter 2, Capital Budgeting Decisions.


1-1 How Does the System of Interlocking Budgets Work? 9

The end result of all the budgets just described is a set of financial statements that
reflect the impact on the company of the upcoming budget. At a minimum, these
statements should include the income statement and cash flow statement, since these
are the best evidence of fiscal health during the budget period. The balance sheet is less
necessary, since the key factors upon which it reports are related to cash, and that
information is already contained within the cash flow statement. These reports should
be directly linked to all the other budgets, so that any changes to the budgets will
immediately appear in the financial statements. The management team will closely
examine these statements and make numerous adjustments to the budgets in order to
arrive at a satisfactory financial result.

The budget-linked financial statements are also a good place to store related
operational and financial ratios, so that the management team can review this
information and revise the budgets in order to alter the ratios to match benchmarking
or industry standards that may have been set as goals. Typical measurements in this
area can include revenue and income per person, inventory turnover ratios, and gross
margin percentages. This type of information is also useful for lenders, who may have
required minimum financial performance results as part of loan agreements, such as a
minimum current ratio or debt-to-equity ratio.

The cash forecast is of exceptional importance, for it tells company managers
whether the proposed budget model will be feasible. If cash projects result in major
cash needs that cannot be met by any possible financing, then the model must be
changed. The assumptions that go into the cash forecast should be based on strict
historical fact, rather than the wishes of managers. This stricture is particularly
important in the case of cash receipts from accounts receivable. If the assumptions are
changed in the model to reflect an advanced rate of cash receipts that exceeds anything
that the company has heretofore experienced, then it is very unlikely that it will be
achieved during the budget period. Instead, it is better to use proven collection periods
as assumptions and alter other parts of the budget to ensure that cash flows remain
positive.

The cash forecast is a particularly good area in which to spot the impact of changes
incredit policy. For example, if a company wishes to expand its share of the market by
allowing easy credit to marginal customers, then it should lengthen the assumed
collection period in the cash forecast to see if there is a significant downgrading of the
resulting cash flows.

The other key factor in the cash forecast is the use of delays in budgeted accounts
payable payments. It is common for managers to budget for extended payment terms
in order to fund other cash flow needs, but there are several problems that can result
from this policy. One is the possible loss of key suppliers who will not tolerate late
payments. Another is the risk of being charged interest on late payments to suppliers.
A third problem is that suppliers may relegate a company to a lower level on their lists
of shipment priorities, since they are being paid late. Finally, suppliers may simply
raise their prices in order to absorb the cost of the late payments. Consequently, the
late payment strategy must be followed with great care, using it only on those
suppliers who do not appear to notice, and otherwise doing it only after prior


10 Management Accounting Best Practices

negotiation with targeted suppliers to make the changed terms part of the standard
buying agreement.

The last document in the system of budgets is the discussion of financing
alternatives. This is not strictly a budget, though it will contain a single line item,
derived from the cash forecast, which itemizes funding needs during each period
itemized in the budget. In all other respects, it is simply a discussion of financing
alternatives, which can be quite varied. This may involve a mix of debt, supplier
financing, preferred stock, common stock, or some other, more innovative approach.
The document should contain a discussion of the cost of each form of financing, the
ability of the company to obtain it, and when it can be obtained. Managers may find
that there are so few financing alternatives available, or that the cost of financing is so
high, that the entire budget must be restructured in order to avoid the negative cash
flow that calls for the financing. There may also be a need for feedback from this
document back into the budgeted financial statements in order to account for the cost
of obtaining the funding, as well as any related interest costs.

1-2 WHAT DOES A SAMPLE BUDGET LOOK LIKE?

 

In response this question, we will review several variations on how a budget can be
constructed, using a number of examples. The first budget covered is the revenue
budget, which is shown in Exhibit 1.2. The exhibit uses quarterly revenue figures
for a budget year rather than monthly, in order to conserve space. It contains revenue
estimates for three different product lines that are designated as Alpha, Beta, and
Charlie.

The Alpha product line uses a budgeting format that identifies the specific
quantities that are expected to be sold in each quarter, as well as the average price
per unit sold. This format is most useful when there are not so many products that such
a detailed delineation would create an excessively lengthy budget. It is a very useful
format, for the sales staff can go into the budget model and alter unit volumes and
prices quite easily. An alternative format is to reveal this level of detail for only the
most important products, and to lump the revenue from other products into a single
line item, as is the case for the Beta product line.

The most common budgeting format is used for the Beta product line, where we
avoid the use of detailed unit volumes and prices in favor of a single lump-sum
revenue total for each reporting period. This format is used when there are multiple
products within each product line, making it cumbersome to create a detailed list of
individual products. However, this format is the least informative and gives no easy
way to update the supporting information.

Yet another budgeting format is shown for the Charlie product line, where
projected sales are grouped by region. This format is most useful when there are
many sales personnel, each of whom has been assigned a specific territory in which to
operate. This budget can then be used to judge the ongoing performance of each
salesperson.

These revenue reporting formats can also be combined, so that the product line
detail for the Alpha product can be used as underlying detail for the sales regions used
for the Charlie product line—though this will result in a very lengthy budget
document.

There is also a statistics section at the bottom of the revenue budget that itemizes
the proportion of total sales that occurs in each quarter, plus the proportion of product
line sales within each quarter. Though it is not necessary to use these exact
measurements, it is useful to include some type of measure that informs the reader
of any variations in sales from period to period.

Both the production and inventory budgets are shown in Exhibit 1.3. The inventory
budget is itemized at the top of the exhibit, where we itemize the amount of planned
inventory turnover in all three inventory categories. There is a considerable ramp-up
in work-in-process inventory turnover, indicating the planned installation of a
manufacturing planning system of some kind that will control the flow of materials
through the facility.

The production budget for just the Alpha product line is shown directly below the
inventory goals. This budget is not concerned with the cost of production, but rather
with the number of units that will be produced. In this instance, we begin with an on-
hand inventory of 15,000 units, and try to keep enough units on hand through the
remainder of the budget year to meet both the finished goods inventory goal at the top
of the exhibit and the number of required units to be sold, which is referenced from the
revenue budget. The main problem is that the maximum capacity of the bottleneck
operation is 20,000 units per quarter. In order to meet the revenue target, we must run


1-2 What Does a Sample Budget Look Like? 13

that operation at full bore through the first three quarters, irrespective of the inventory
turnover target. This is especially important because the budget indicates a jump in
bottleneck capacity in the fourth quarter from 20,000 to 40,000 units—this will occur
when the bottleneck operation is stopped for a short time while additional equipment
is added to it. During this stoppage, there must be enough excess inventory on hand to
cover any sales that will arise. Consequently, production is planned for 20,000 units
per quarter for the first three quarters, followed by a more precisely derived figure in
the fourth quarter that will result in inventory turns of 9.0 at the end of the year, exactly
as planned.

The production budget can be enhanced with the incorporation of planned
machine downtime for maintenance, as well as for the planned loss of production
units to scrap. It is also useful to plan for the capacity needs of nonbottleneck work
centers, since these areas will require varying levels of staffing, depending on the
number of production shifts needed.

The purchasing budget is shown in Exhibit 1.4. This contains several different
formats for planning budgeted purchases for the Alpha product line. The first option
summarizes the planned production for each quarter; this information is brought
forward from the production budget. We then multiply this by the standard unit cost of
materials to arrive at the total amount of purchases that must be made in order to
adequately support sales. The second option identifies the specific cost of each
component of the product, so that management can see where cost increases are
expected to occur. Though this version provides more information, it occupies a great
deal of space on the budget if there are many components in each product, or many
products. A third option is shown at the bottom of the exhibit that summarizes all
purchases by commodity type. This format is most useful for the company’s buyers,
who usually specialize in certain commodity types.

The purchasing budget can be enhanced by adding a scrap factor for budgeted
production, which will result in slightly higher quantities to buy, thereby leaving less
chance of running out of raw materials. Another upgrade to the exhibit would be to
schedule purchases for planned production some time in advance of the actual
manufacturing date, so that the purchasing staff will be assured of having the parts
on hand when manufacturing begins. A third enhancement is to round off the pur-
chasing volumes for each item into the actual buying volumes that can be obtained on
the open market. For example, it may be possible to buy the required labels only in
volumes of 100,000 at a time, which would result in a planned purchase at the
beginning of the year that would be large enough to cover all production needs through
the end of the year.

The direct labor budget is shown in Exhibit 1.5. This budget assumes that only one
labor category will vary directly with revenue volume; that category is the final
assembly department, where a percentage in the far right column indicates that the
cost in this area will be budgeted at a fixed 3.5 percent of total revenues. In all other
cases, there are assumptions for a fixed number of personnel in each position within
each production department. All of the wage figures for each department (except for
final assembly) are derived from the planned hourly rates and headcount figures noted

at the bottom of the page. This budget can be enhanced with the addition of separate
line items for payroll tax percentages, benefits, shift differential payments, and
overtime expenses. The cost of the final assembly department can also be adjusted to
account for worker efficiency, which will be lower during production ramp-up periods
when new, untrained employees are added to the workforce.

A sample of the overhead budget is shown in Exhibit 1.6. In this exhibit, we see
that the overhead budget is really made up of a number of subsidiary departments,
such as maintenance, materials management, and quality assurance. If the budgets of
any of these departments are large enough, it makes a great deal of sense to split them
off into a separate budget, so that the managers of those departments can see their
budgeted expectations more clearly. Of particular interest in this exhibit is the valid

capacity range noted on the far-right side of the exhibit. This signifies the production
activity level within which the budgeted overhead costs are accurate. If the actual
capacity utilization were to fall outside of this range, either high or low, a separate
overhead budget should be constructed with costs that are expected to be incurred
within those ranges.

A sample cost-of-goods-sold budget is shown in Exhibit 1.7. This format splits out
each of the product lines noted in the revenue budget for reporting purposes, and
subtracts from each one the materials costs that are noted in the purchases budget. This
results in a contribution margin for each product line that is the clearest representation
of the impact of direct costs (usually direct material costs) on each one. We then
summarize these individual contribution margins into a summary-level contribution
margin, and then subtract the total direct labor and overhead costs (as referenced from
the direct labor and overhead budgets) to arrive at a total gross margin. The statistics
section also notes the number of production personnel budgeted for each quarterly
reporting period, plus the average annual revenue per production employee—these
statistics can be replaced with any operational information that management wants to
see at a summary level for the production function, such as efficiency levels, capacity
utilization, or inventory turnover.

The sales department budget is shown in Exhibit 1.8. This budget shows several
different ways in which to organize the budget information. At the top of the budget is
a block of line items that lists the expenses for those overhead costs within the
department that cannot be specifically linked to a salesperson or region. In cases
where the number of sales staff is quite small, all of the department’s costs may be
listed in this area.

Another alternative is shown in the second block of expense line items in the
middle of the sales department budget, where all of the sales costs for an entire product
line are lumped together into a single line item. If each person on the sales staff is
exclusively assigned to a single product line, then it may make sense to break down the
budget into separate budget pages for each product line, and list all of the expenses
associated with each product line on a separate page.

A third alternative is shown next in the exhibit, where we list a summary of
expenses for each sales person. This format works well when combined with the
departmental overhead expenses at the top of the budget, since this accounts for all of
the departmental costs. However, this format brings up a confidentiality issue, since
the compensation of each sales person can be inferred from the report. Also, this
format would include the commission expense paid to each sales person; since
commissions are a variable cost that is directly associated with each incremental
dollar of sales, they should be itemized as a separate line item within the cost of goods
sold.

A final option listed at the bottom of the example is to itemize expenses by
sales region. This format works best when there are a number of sales personnel within
the department who are clustered into a number of clearly identifiable regions. If there
were no obvious regions or if there were only one salesperson per region, then the
better format would be to list expenses by salesperson.

At the bottom of the budget is the usual statistics section. The sales department
budget is concerned only with making sales, so it should be no surprise that revenue
per salesperson is the first item listed. Also, since the primary sales cost associated
with this department is usually travel costs, the other statistical item is the travel and

entertainment cost per person.

Exhibit 1.9 shows a sample marketing budget. As was the case for the sales
department, this one also itemizes departmental overhead costs at the top, which
leaves space in the middle for the itemization of campaign-specific costs in the
middle. The campaign-specific costs can be lumped together for individual product
lines, as is the case for product lines Alpha and Beta in the exhibit, or with subsidiary
line items, as is shown for product line Charlie. A third possible format, which is to
itemize marketing costs by marketing tool (e.g., advertising, promotional tour,
coupon redemption, etc.) is generally not recommended if there is more than one
product line, since there is no way for an analyst to determine the impact of individual
marketing costs on specific product lines. The statistics at the bottom of the page
attempt to compare marketing costs to sales; however, this should be treated as only an

approximation, since marketing efforts will usually not result in immediate sales, but
rather will result in sales that build over time. Thus, there is a time lag after incurring a
marketing cost that makes it difficult to determine the efficacy of marketing activities.

A sample general and administrative budget is shown in Exhibit 1.10. This budget
can be quite lengthy, including such additional line items as postage, copier leases,
and office repair. Many of these extra expenses have been pruned from the exhibit in
order to provide a compressed view of the general format to be used. The exhibit does
not lump together the costs of the various departments that are typically included in
this budget, but rather identifies each one in separate blocks; this format is most useful
when there are separate managers for the accounting and human resources functions,
so that they will have a better understanding of their budgets. The statistics section at
the bottom of the page itemizes a benchmark target of the total general and
administrative cost as a proportion of revenue. This is a particularly useful statistic

multiple positions identified within each job category, the average salary for each
cluster of jobs is identified. If a position is subject to overtime pay, its expected
overtime percentage is identified on the right side of the budget. Many sections of the
budget should have linkages to this page, so that any changes in headcount here will be
automatically reflected in the other sections. This budget may have to be restricted
from general access, since it contains salary information that may be considered
confidential information.

The facilities budget tends to have the largest number of expense line items. A
sample of this format is shown in Exhibit 1.12. These expenses may be offset by some
rental or sub-lease revenues if a portion of the company facilities is rented out to other
organizations. However, this revenue is shown in this budget only if the revenue
amount is small; otherwise, it is more commonly found as an “other revenue’’ line
item on the revenue budget. A statistics section is found at the bottom of this budget
that refers to the total amount of square feet occupied by the facility. A very effective
statistic is the amount of unused square footage, which can be used to conduct an
ongoing program of selling off, renting, or consolidating company facilities.

The research department’s budget is shown in Exhibit 1.13. It is most common to
segregate the department-specific overhead that cannot be attributed to a specific project
at the top of the budget, and then cluster costs by project below that. By doing so, the
management team can see precisely how much money is being allocated to each project.
This may be of use in determining which projects must be canceled or delayed as part of
the budget review process. The statistics section at the bottom of the budget notes the
proportion of planned expenses among the categories of overhead, research, and
development. These proportions can be examined to see whether the company is
allocating funds to the right balance of projects that most effectively meets it product
development goals.

The capital budget is shown in Exhibit 1.14. This format clusters capital
expenditures by a number of categories. For example, the first category, entitled
“bottleneck-related expenditures,” clearly focuses attention on those outgoing
payments that will increase the company’s key productive capacity. The payments
in the third quarter under this heading are directly related to the increase in bottleneck
capacity that was shown the production budget for the fourth quarter. The budget also
contains an automatic assumption of $7,000 in capital expenditures for any net

increase in non-direct labor headcount, which encompasses the cost of computer
equipment and office furniture for each person. If the company’s capitalization limit is
set too high to list these expenditures on the capital budget, then a similar line item
should be inserted into the general and administrative budget, so that the expense can
be recognized under the office supplies or some similar account.

The capital budget also includes a category for profit-related expenditures. Any
projects listed in this category should be subject to an intensive expenditure review to
ensure that they return a sufficient cash flow to make their acquisition profitable to the
company. Other categories in the budget cover expenditures for safety or required
items, which tend to be purchased with no cash flow discounting review. An alter-
native to this grouping system is to list only the sum total of all capital expenditures in
each category, which is most frequently done when there are far too many separate
purchases to list on the budget. Another variation is to list only the largest expen-
ditures on separate budget lines, and cluster together all smaller ones. The level of
capital purchasing activity will determine the type of format used.

All of the preceding budgets roll up into the budgeted income and cash flow
statement, which is noted in Exhibit 1.15. This format lists the grand totals from all
preceding pages of the budget in order to arrive at a profit or loss for each budget
quarter. In the example, we see that a large initial loss in the first quarter is gradually

the presentation continues with a cash flow statement that has less positive results. It
begins with the net profit figure for each quarter, adds back the depreciation expense
for all departments, and subtracts out all planned capital expenditures from the capital
budget to arrive at cash flow needs for the year. This tells us that the company will

experience a maximum cash shortfall in the third quarter. This format can be made
more precise by adding in time lag factors for the payment of accounts payable and the
collection of accounts receivable.

The final document in the budget is an itemization of the finances needed to ensure
that the rest of the budget can be achieved. An example is shown in Exhibit 1.16,
which carries forward the final cash position at the end of each quarter that was the
product of the preceding cash flow statement. This line shows that there will be a
maximum shortfall of $223,727 by the end of the third quarter. The next section of the
budget outlines several possible options for obtaining the required funds (which are
rounded up to $225,000)—debt, preferred stock, or common stock. The financing cost
of each one is noted in the far-right column, where we see that the interest cost on debt
is 9.5 percent, the dividend on preferred stock is 8 percent, and the expected return by
common stockholders is 18 percent.

The third section on the page lists the existing capital structure, its cost, and the net
cost of capital. This is quite important, for anyone reviewing this document can see
what impact the financing options will have on the capital structure if any of them are
selected. For example, the management team may prefer the low cost of debt, but can


28 Management Accounting Best Practices

also use the existing capital structure presentation to see that this will result in a very
high proportion of debt to equity, which increases the risk that the company cannot
afford to repay the debt to the lender.

The fourth and final part of the budget calculates any changes in the cost of capital
that will arise if any of the three financing options are selected. A footnote points out
the incremental corporate tax rate; this is of importance to the calculation of the cost of
capital, because the interest cost of debt can be deducted as an expense, thereby
reducing its net cost. In the exhibit, selecting additional debt as the preferred form of
financing will result in a reduction in the cost of capital to 10.7 percent, whereas a
selection of high-cost common stock will result in an increase in the cost of capital to
12.9 percent. These changes can have an impact on what types of capital projects are
accepted in the future, for the cash flows associated with them must be discounted by
the cost of capital in order to see if they result in positive cash flows. Accordingly, a
reduction in the cost of capital will mean that projects with marginal cash flows will
become more acceptable, while the reverse will be true for a higher cost of capital.

The budgeting examples shown here can be used as the format for a real-life
corporate budget. However, it must be adjusted to include a company’s chart of
accounts and departmental structure, so that it more accurately reflects actual
operations. Also, it should include a detailed benefits and payroll tax calculation
page, which will itemize the cost of Social Security taxes, Medicare, unemployment
insurance, worker’s compensation insurance, medical insurance, and so on. These
costs are a substantial part of a company’s budget, and yet are commonly lumped
together into a simplistic budget model that does not accurately reflect their true cost.

Though the budget model presented here may seem excessively large, it is
necessary to provide detailed coverage of all aspects of the corporation, so that
prospective changes to it can be accurately modeled through the budget. Thus, a
detailed format is strongly recommended over a simple, summarized model.

1-3 HOW DOES FLEX BUDGETING WORK?

 

One problem with the traditional budget model is that many of the expenses listed in it
are directly tied to the revenue level. If the actual revenue incurred is significantly
different from the budgeted figure, then so many expenses will also shift in association
with the revenue that the comparison of budgeted to actual expenses will not be valid.
For example, if budgeted revenues are $1 million and budgeted material costs are
$450,000, one would expect a corresponding drop in the actual cost of materials
incurred if actual revenues drop to $800,000. A budget-to-actual comparison would
then show a significant difference in the cost of materials, which would in turn cause a
difference in the gross margin and net profit. This issue also arises for a number of
other variable or semivariable expenses, such as salesperson commissions, production
supplies, and maintenance costs. Also, if there are really large differences between
actual and budgeted revenue levels, other costs that are more fixed in nature will also
change, such as the salaries, office supplies, and even facilities maintenance (since


1-4 What Best Practices Can | Apply to the Budgeting Process? 29

facilities may be sold off or added to, depending on which direction actual revenues
have gone). These represent large step cost changes that will skew actual expenses so
far away from the budget that it is difficult to conduct any meaningful comparison
between the two.

A good way to resolve this problem is to create a flexible budget, or “‘flex”’ budget
that itemizes different expense levels depending upon changes in the amount of actual
revenue. In its simplest form, the flex budget will use percentages of revenue for
certain expenses, rather than the usual fixed numbers. This allows for an infinite series
of changes in budgeted expenses that are directly tied to revenue volume. However,
this approach ignores changes to other costs that do not change in accordance with
small revenue variations. Consequently, a more sophisticated format will also
incorporate changes to many additional expenses when certain larger revenue
changes occur, thereby accounting for step costs. By making these changes to
the budget, a company will have a tool for comparing actual with budgeted
performance at many levels of activity.

Though the flex budget is a good tool, it can be difficult to formulate and
administer. One problem with its formulation is that many costs are not fully variable,
instead having a fixed cost component that must be included in the flex budget
formula. Another issue is that a great deal of time can be spent developing step costs,
which is more time than the typical accounting staff has available, especially when in
the midst of creating the standard budget. Consequently, the flex budget tends to
include only a small number of step costs, as well as variable costs whose fixed cost
components are not fully recognized.

Implementation of the flex budget is also a problem, for very few accounting
software packages incorporate any features that allow one to load in multiple versions
of a budget that can be used at different revenue levels. Instead, some include the
option to store a few additional budgets, which the user can then incorporate into the
standard budget-to-actual comparison reports. This option does not yield the full
benefits of a flex budget, since it allows for only a few changes in expenses based on a
small number of revenue changes, rather than a set of expenses that will automatically
change in proportion to actual revenue levels incurred. Furthermore, the option to
enter several different budgets means that someone must enter this additional
information into the accounting software, which can be a considerable chore if
the number of budget line items is large. For these reasons, it is more common to see a
flex budget incorporated into an electronic spreadsheet, with actual results being
manually posted to it from other accounting reports.

1-4 WHAT BEST PRACTICES CAN | APPLY
TO THE BUDGETING PROCESS?

 

The budgeting process is usually rife with delays, which are caused by several factors.
One is that information must be input to the budget model from all parts of the
company—some of which may not put a high priority on the submission of budgeting


30 Management Accounting Best Practices

information. Another reason is that the budgeting process is highly iterative, some-
times requiring dozens of budget recalculations and changes in assumptions before
the desired results are achieved. The typical budgeting process is represented in
Exhibit 1.17, where we see that there is a sequential process that requires the
completion of the revenue plan before the production plan can be completed, which
in turn must be finished before the departmental expense budgets can be finished,
which then yields a financing plan. If the results do not meet expectations, then the
process starts over again at the top of the exhibit. This process is so time-consuming
that the budget may not be completed before the budget period has already begun.

There are a number of best practices that can be used to create a more streamlined
budgeting process, which are as follows:

¢ Reduce the number of accounts. The number of accounts included in the budget
should be reduced, thereby greatly reducing the amount of time needed to enter
and update data in the budget model.

¢ Reduce the number of reporting periods. Consolidate the 12 months shown in
the typical budget into quarterly information, thereby eliminating two-thirds of
the information in the budget. If the budget must later be reentered into the
accounting system in order to provide budget-to-actual comparisons, then a
simple formula can be used to divide the quarterly budget back into its monthly
components—which is still much less work than maintaining 12 full months of
budget information.

¢ Use percentages for variable cost updates. When key activities, such as reven-
ues, are changed in the budget model, one must peruse the entire budget in order
to determine what related expenses must change in concert with the key activities.
A much easier approach is to use percentage-based calculations for variable costs
in the budget model, so that these expenses will be updated automatically. They
should also be color-coded in the budget model, so that they will not be mistaken
for items that are manually changed.

¢ Report on variables in one place. A number of key variables will impact the
typical budget model, such as the assumed rate of inflation in wages or purchased
parts, tax rates for income, payroll, and worker’s compensation, medical insur-
ance rates, and so on. These variables are much easier to find if they are set up ina
cluster within the budget, so that one can easily reference and alter them. Under
this arrangement, it is also useful to show key results (such as net profits) on the
same page with the variables, in order to make alterations to the variables and
immediately see their impact without having to search through the budget model
to find the information.

¢ Use a budget procedure and timetable. The budget process is plagued by many
iterations, since the first results will nearly always yield profits or losses that do
not meet a company’s expectations. Furthermore, it requires input from all parts of
a company, some of which may lag in sending in information in a timely manner.
Accordingly, it is best to construct a budgeting procedure that specifically identifies

what job positions must send budgeting information to the budget coordinator,
what information is required of each person, and when that information is due.
Furthermore, there should be a clear timetable of events that is carefully adhered to,
so that plenty of time is left at the end of the budgeting process for the calculation of
multiple iterations of the budget.

In addition to these efficiency-improvement issues, there are other ways to modify

the budgeting process so that it can be completed much more quickly. The following
changes should be considered:

Preload budget line items. Rather than requiring department managers to fill out
a blank budget form for the upcoming budget year, have the accounting staff
preload many of the budget line items with information from the current year.
Most expenses are relatively fixed from year to year, or are easily linked to key
drivers, such as headcount. Consequently, the accounting staff can probably
arrive at more accurate budget numbers than a department manager for most line
items. This approach leaves only a few of the larger and more variable accounts
for managers to enter in the budget form. In some cases where a department is
anticipating no major changes for the next budget year, it may even be possible
for the accounting staff to create the entire department budget, so the department
manager has only to make revisions to it.

Itemize the corporate strategy. The strategy and related tactical goals that the
company is trying to achieve should be listed at the beginning of the budget
model. All too frequently, management loses sight of its predetermined strategy
when going through the many iterations that are needed to develop a realistic
budget. By itemizing the corporate strategy in the budget document, it is much
less likely that the final budget model will deviate significantly from the
company’s strategic direction.

Identify step-costing change points. The budget model should have notations
incorporated into it that specify the capacity levels at which expenses are valid.
For example, if the production level for product A exceeds 100,000 per year, then
a warning flag should be generated by the budget model that informs the budget
manager of the need to add an extra shift to accommodate the increased
production requirements. Another example is to have the model generate a
warning flag when the average revenue per salesperson exceeds $1,000,000, since
this may be the maximum expectation for sales productivity, and will require the
addition of more sales personnel to the budget. These flags can be clustered at the
front of the budget model, so that problems will be readily apparent to the reader.

Specify maximum amounts of available funding. One of the warning flags just
noted should include the maximum level of funding that the company can obtain.
If an iteration of the budget model results in excessively high cash requirements,
then the flag will immediately point out the problem. It may be useful to note next
to the warning flag the amount by which the maximum funding has been exceeded,
so that this information is readily available for the next budget iteration.


1-4 What Best Practices Can | Apply to the Budgeting Process? 33

¢ Base expense changes on cost drivers. Many expenses in the budget will
vary in accordance with changes in various activities within the firm. As noted
earlier in this section, expenses can be listed in the budget model as formulas, so
that they vary in direct proportion to changes in budgeted revenue. This same
concept can be taken a step further by listing other types of activities that drive
cost behavior, and linking still other expenses to them with formulas. For
example, the amount of telephone expense is directly related to the number
of employees, so it can be linked to the total number of employees on the staffing
budget. Another example is the number of machine setup personnel, which
will change based on the planned number of production batches to be run during
the year. This level of automation requires a significant degree of knowledge
of how selected expenses interact with various activities within the company.

¢ Budget by groups of staff positions. A budget can rapidly become unwieldy if
every position in the company is individually identified—especially if the names
of all employees are listed. This format requires constant updating as the budget
progresses through multiple iterations. A better approach is to itemize by job title,
which allows one to vastly reduce the number of job positions listed in the budget.

¢ Rank projects. A more complex budget model can incorporate a ranking of all
capital projects, so that any projects with a low ranking will be automatically
eliminated by the model if the available amount of cash drops below the point
where they could be funded. However, this variation requires that great attention
be paid to the ranking of projects, since there may be some interrelationship
between projects—if one is dropped but others are retained, then the ones
retained may not be functional without the missing project.

¢ Issue a summary-level model for use by senior management. The senior manage-
ment team is primarily concerned with the summary results of each department,
product line, or operating division, and does not have time to wade through the
details of individual revenue and expense accounts. Further, they may require an
increased level of explanation from the budgeting staff if they do choose to
examine these details. Accordingly, the speed of the iteration process can be
enhanced by producing a summary-level budget that is directly linked to the main
budget, so that all fields in it are updated automatically. The senior management
team can more easily review this document, yielding faster updates to the model.

¢ Link budget results to an employee goal and reward system. The budgeting
process does not end with the final approval of the budget model. Instead, it then
passes to the human resources department, which uses it as the foundation for an
employee goal and reward system. The trouble is that if budget approval is delayed,
the human resources department will have very little time in which to create its goal
and reward system. Accordingly, this add-on project should be incorporated
directly into the budget model, so that it is approved alongside the rest of the
budget. For example, a goals and rewards statement added to the budget can specify
a bonus payment to the manager of the production department if he or she can create
the number of units of product specified in the production budget. Similarly, the

sales manager can receive a bonus based on reaching the sales goals noted in
the revenue budget. By inserting the bonus amounts in this page of the budget, the
model can automatically link them to the final targets itemized in the plan, requiring
minimal further adjustments by the human resources staff.

As aresult of these improvements, the budgeting process will change to the format
shown in Exhibit 1.18, where the emphasis moves away from many modeling
iterations toward the incorporation of a considerable level of automation and
streamlining into the structure of the budget model. By following this approach,
the budget will require much less manual updating; this will allow it to sail through the
smaller number of required iterations with much greater speed.

1-5 HOW CAN | INTEGRATE THE BUDGET INTO
THE CORPORATE CONTROL SYSTEM?

 

There are several ways in which a budget can be used to enhance a company’s control
systems so that objectives are more easily met and it is more difficult for costs to stray
from approved levels.

One of the best methods for controlling costs is to link the budget for each expense
within each department to the purchasing system. By doing so, the computer system
will automatically accumulate the total amount of purchase orders that have been
issued thus far against a specific account, and will refuse any further purchase orders
when the budgeted expense total has been reached. This approach can involve the
comparison of the monthly budget to monthly costs, or compare costs with annual
budgeted totals. The latter approach can cause difficulty for the inattentive manager,
since actual expenses may be running well ahead of the budget for most of the year, but
the system will not automatically flag the problem until the entire year’s budget has
been depleted. Alternatively, a comparison to monthly budgeted figures may result in
so many warning flags on so many accounts that the purchasing staff is unable to
purchase many items. One workaround for this problem is to use a fixed overage
percentage by which purchases are allowed to exceed the budget; another possibility
is to compare cumulative expenses only with quarterly budget totals, which reduces
the total number of system warning flags.

Another budgetary control system is to compare actual with budgeted results for
the specific purpose of evaluating the performance of employees. For example, the
warehouse manager may be judged based on actual inventory turnover of 12x, which
compares unfavorably to a budgeted turnover rate of 15 x. Similarly, the manager of a
cost center may receive a favorable review if the total monthly cost of her cost center
averages no more than $152,000. This also works for the sales staff, who can be
assigned sales quotas that match the budgeted sales levels for their sales territories.
In this manner, a large number of employees can have their compensation levels
directly tied to the achievement of budgeted goals. This is a highly effective way to
ensure that the budget becomes a fixture in the lives of employees.


36 Management Accounting Best Practices

However, there is also a problem with linking employee pay to performance levels
as outlined in the budget. If employees realize that they will fall short of their bonus
targets, they will be more likely to hoard their resources or possible sales for the next
period, when they will have a better opportunity to achieve better performance and
be paid a bonus. The result is wild swings in corporate performance from period to
period as employees cycle through the hoard-to-splurge circuit. Employees may also
stretch or break the accounting rules in a variety of ways to achieve the target. The
solution is to link the budget to a sliding performance scale that contains no “hard”
performance goals. The best example of the sliding bonus scale is what it is not—there
are no specific goals at which the bonus target suddenly increases in size. Instead, the
bonus is a constant percentage of the goal, such as | percent of sales or 5 percent of net
after-tax profits. Also, there should be no upper boundary to the sliding scale, which
would present employees with the disincentive to stop performing once they have
reached a maximum bonus level. Similarly, there should theoretically be no lower
limit to the bonus either, though it is more common to see a baseline level that is
derived from the corporate breakeven point, on the grounds that employees must at
least ensure that the company does not lose money. The sliding scale approach also
makes it much easier to budget for the bonus expense at various activity levels, rather
than trying to budget for the more common all-or-nothing bonus payment.

Yet another budgetary control system is to use it as a feedback loop to employees.
This can be done by issuing a series of reports at the end of each reporting period that
are specifically designed to match the responsibilities of each employee. For example,
Exhibit 1.19 shows a single revenue line item that is reported to a salesperson for a
single territory. The salesperson does not need to see any other detailed comparison
with the budget, because he is not responsible for anything besides the specific line
item that is reported to him. This reporting approach focuses the attention of many
employees on just those segments of the budget over which they have control. Though
this approach can result in the creation of dozens or even hundreds of reports by the
accounting department, they can be automated on most packaged accounting software
systems, so that only the initial report creation will take up much accounting time.

An additional control use for the budget is to detect fraud. The budget is usually
based on several years of actual operating results, so unless there are major changes in
activity levels, actual expense results should be fairly close to budgeted expectations.
If not, variance analysis is frequently used to find out what happened. This process is
an excellent means for discovering fraud, since this activity will usually result in a
sudden surge in expense levels, which the resulting variance analysis will detect. The
two instances in which this control will not work is when the fraud has been in
existence for a long time (and so is incorporated into the budgeted expense numbers

already) or the amount of fraud is so low that it will not create a variance large enough
to warrant investigation.

1-6 HOW DO THROUGHPUT CONCEPTS IMPACT
THE BUDGET?

 

Ina traditional budget, the entire budget model is driven by the revenue forecast, since
this information is needed to derive materials purchases, inventory and staffing levels,
and operating expenses. The revenue forecast is usually summarized in one of two
ways: either by total revenue dollars for each product, or by total revenue dollars by
customer (which is more common when dealing with labor hour billings).

Though a valid way to obtain top-line revenue projections, this information lacks
any clear linkage to directly variable costs, so managers cannot tell from the revenue
budget alone how revenue projections will impact profitability. In addition, it does not
show the impact of sales projections on the company’s capacity constraint. A better
approach is to develop a throughput forecast, either by product or customer, that
clearly shows the impact on both profits and the capacity constraint.

Exhibit 1.20 shows a traditional revenue forecast for several products, followed by
a revised forecast that reveals the individual and cumulative throughput levels for the
same products and product quantities shown in the original forecast.

The traditional product revenue budget shown at the top of Exhibit 1.20 presents
the usual itemization of estimated product sales that many of us are accustomed to
seeing. However, this view has serious shortcomings when compared with the much
richer set of information listed in the bottom half of the exhibit for throughput-based
information. The latter portion of the exhibit reveals that the company is incapable
of meeting its revenue budget, because there is not a sufficient amount of capacity
available (based on 260 working days, at three shifts, assuming 80% efficiency) to
meet its sales goals. A traditional budget would not have flagged this constraint
problem anywhere, so the company would have constructed a fundamentally unsound
budget and proceeded to implement it, with an essentially guaranteed revenue
shortfall being the only possible outcome.

In addition, the enhanced budget shows that the company earns the least
throughput per minute on its top-of-the-line carbon and titanium bikes; depending
on the marketing effect of this decision, management could elect to drop production of
both bikes, thereby bringing remaining estimated bike sales within range of the
constraint limitation, while minimizing the resulting negative impact on throughput.
Thus, the throughput approach to the revenue budget not only reveals problems with
the initial forecast, but also presents a possible solution regarding how the sales mix
might be modified.

A further note on the use of the throughput-based product revenue budget is to list
the same product multiple times if it is forecasted to be sold to different customers at
different prices (in which case it is useful to identify the customers in the budget for
each line item). This makes it easier to see the throughput per unit at each price point.

1-6 How Do Throughput Concepts Impact the Budget? 39

The same approach can be taken with a revenue budget that is based on sales by
customer. The example shown in Exhibit 1.21 assumes that sales are based on billable
hours to customers.

The traditional revenue budgeting model shown in Exhibit 1.21 shows an estimate
of revenues by customer, with no additional interpretive information. However, the
throughput-based version at the bottom of the exhibit reveals a great deal more
information. When variable costs (in this case, labor) are subtracted from the budgeted
revenue to arrive at throughput, we find that there is a loss on the work being done for
the Mining Safety Engineers customer, which may prompt a discussion of repricing
this work or of dropping the customer. In addition, the model then summarizes the
labor used in the various customer projects by labor category and calculates the
amount of staffing required, based on the estimate of billable hours and an 80 percent
billable percentage for each employee. This information tells management that it
must hire additional staff in several labor categories in order to have sufficient staff to
meet its revenue budget.

The main reason for a budget is to give management a model of how the company
should operate during the budget period, based on the impact of operational and
financial changes that management wants to implement during the budget period.
However, the traditional budget model is designed to show results based on the local
optimization of resources, rather than systemwide resources, which usually results in
counterproductive budgeting decisions. For example, if expenses are projected to be
too high, management may mandate an across-the-board 10 percent budget cut for all
departments, which will likely both reduce the capacity of the constrained resource
and shrink operating expenses to such an extent that the ability of the entire system to
support the current level of throughput has now been reduced.

Unfortunately, it is very difficult to create a quantitative format for how a change in
operating expenses will impact total system throughput, since in many cases there
does not appear to be a direct or even an indirect link between some costs and the
generation of throughput. Consequently, the creation of a budget where expenses
support throughput generation requires an extremely detailed knowledge of how the
entire system works together to create throughput.

In many cases where no link between an expense and throughput can be found,
management is still able to wield a sharp budgeting axe in cutting expenses. Thus,
there are considerable differences in how various budget line items should be treated,
based on their impact on throughput. Any expense supporting throughput should be
cut only after detailed review by a process analyst, while other expenses can be cut
with much less review. This interpretation of the budget model results in a change in
the budgeting format, which is shown in Exhibit 1.22. The exhibit shows a before-and-
after department budget where the first version ignores the impact of throughput,
while the second version splits operating expenses into those impacting throughput
and those that do not. The expenses in the second version can be shifted between the
two categories based on whether they affect the company’s throughput capacity.

However, the exhibit clearly shows that most expenses will be attributable in some
manner to throughput capacity, since most corporate expenses involve departments

marketing, and sales. Only such classic overhead expenses as accounting, general
corporate costs, and legal expenses can be reduced with some assurance that the
reductions will not impact throughput.


42 Management Accounting Best Practices

Thus far, the discussion of operating expenses has primarily focused on a
company’s ability to cut expenses. However, how should the budgeting process
handle requests for increased operating expenses? The primary guideline should be
that the existing level of operating expenses is sufficient to handle not only existing but
also any projected increases in throughput. If not, then some elements of operating
expenses become the constraint, at which point increases in those expenses should be
included in the budget.

The standard ways to budget for production staffing levels are to (1) incrementally
adjust existing staffing levels based on forecasted revenue changes or (2) extrapolate
labor requirements derived by multiplying the forecasted revenue for the budget
period by the labor routings for each product listed in the forecast. Many companies
start with the latter method and compare it with the results obtained from the first
approach, and then adopt a hybrid solution. These techniques will yield reasonably
accurate staffing levels for a company attempting to create locally optimized
manufacturing operations. However, they will likely result in inadequate staffing
levels when capacity constraints are taken into account.

When throughput is taken into account, it is necessary to hire additional employ-
ees when either of the following two circumstances arise:

1. When the sprint capacity of key workstations positioned upstream from the
constrained resource is insufficient to recover from system downtime to such an
extent that buffers are repeatedly penetrated

2. When the constrained resource could generate more throughput with the addition
of more staff

It is entirely possible that the constrained resource is not in the production area or
the marketplace at all (the two most common areas), but rather in the sales department.
This problem is most evident when the company’s sales funnel begins with a large
number of prospective sales, but narrows down to a small number of completed sales
due to a bottleneck somewhere in the sales conversion process. The identification of
the constrained resource within the sales funnel can be determined as part of the
budgeting process, usually with an analysis similar to the one shown in Exhibit 1.23.

1-6 How Do Throughput Concepts Impact the Budget? 43

The exhibit shows the basic steps needed to advance through the sales funnel, from
initial identification of the customer through closing the deal. For each step, the table
shows the actual time used on various steps in the process, as compared with the
theoretical amount of staff capacity available for each step. The table reveals that
the constrained resource is the needs assessment, for which the actual time used has
matched the theoretical maximum available. Thus, for budgeting purposes, manage-
ment should bolster the ranks of the sales engineers who are responsible for creating
needs assessments.

Ifa company does not perform this analysis, then it may budget for increases in the
wrong types of sales positions, which will yield no new sales if the additions do not
address the constraint.

Capital Budgeting Decisions

The accountant is usually trained in the use of discounted cash flows to analyze
funding requests for capital projects. A newer approach is constraint management,
which instead focuses attention on allocating funding to bottleneck (constrained)
operations. Both capital budgeting methodologies are presented in this chapter.

If the accountant were to use constraint-based capital budgeting, some key
questions would involve how to determine the cost of a bottleneck operation, how
to locate that operation, whether investments should be made in the operation, and
when investments should be made outside of the bottleneck operation.

If the accountant were to instead use the traditional discounted cash flow method,
some key questions would involve how to calculate and use the cost of capital, how
to derive a project’s net present value, and when to use payback periods and post-
completion project analyses.

This chapter provides answers to all of these key questions. The following
table itemizes the section number in which the answers to each question can be found:

2-1 HOW DOES A CONSTRAINED RESOURCE IMPACT
CAPITAL BUDGETING DECISIONS?

 

Pareto analysis holds that 20 percent of events cause 80 percent of the results. For
example, 20 percent of customers generate 80 percent of all profits, or 20 percent

44


2-2 What Is the True Cost of a Capacity Constraint? 45

of all production issues cause 80 percent of the scrap. The theory of constraints,
when reduced down to one guiding concept, states that 1 percent of all events cause
99 percent of the results. This conclusion is reached by viewing a company as one
giant system designed to produce profits, with one constrained resource controlling
the amount of those profits.

Under the theory of constraints, all management activities are centered on man-
agement of the bottleneck operation, or constrained resource. By focusing on
making this resource more efficient and ensuring that all other company resources
are oriented toward supporting it, a company will maximize its profits. The concept
is shown in Exhibit 2.1, where the total production capacity of four work centers is
shown, both before and after a series of efficiency improvements are made. Of the
four work centers, the capacity of center C is the lowest, at 80 units per hour.
Despite subsequent efficiency improvements to work centers A and B, the total
output of the system remains at 80 units per hour, because of the restriction imposed
by work center C.

This approach is substantially different from the traditional management tech-
nique of local optimization, where all company operations are to be made as
efficient as possible, with machines and employees maximizing their work efforts
at all times. The key difference between the two methodologies is the view of
efficiency: Should it be maximized everywhere, or just at the constrained resource?
The constraints-based approach holds that any local optimization of a nonconstraint
resource will simply allow it to produce more than the constrained operation can
handle, which results in excess inventory. For example, a furniture company
discovers that its drum operation is its paint shop. The company cannot produce
more than 300 tables per day, because that maximizes the capacity of the paint shop.
If the company adds a lathe to produce more table legs, this will only result in the
accumulation of an excessive quantity of table legs, rather than the production of
a larger number of painted tables. Thus, the investment in efficiencies elsewhere
than the constrained operation will only increase costs without improving sales
or profits.

The preceding example shows that not only should efficiency improvements not
be made in areas other than the constrained operation, but it is quite acceptable to not
even be efficient in these other areas. It is better to stop work in a nonconstraint
operation and idle its staff than to have it churn out more inventory than can be used by
the constrained operation.

2-2 WHAT IS THE TRUE COST OF
A CAPACITY CONSTRAINT?

 

If the use of the capacity constraint is not maximized, what is the opportunity cost to
the company? In a traditional cost accounting system, the cost would be the forgone
gross margin on any products that could not be produced by the operation. For example,
a work center experiences downtime of one hour, because the machine operator is on a

scheduled break. During that one hour, the work center could have created 20 products
having a gross margin of $4.00 each. Traditional cost accounting tells us that this
represents a loss of $80. Given this information, a manager might very well not
backfill the machine operator, and allow the machine to stay idle for the one-hour
break period.

However, throughput accounting uses a different calculation of the cost of the
capacity constraint. Since the performance of the constraint drives the total through-
put of the entire system, the opportunity cost of not running that operation is actually
the total operating expense of running the entire facility, divided by the number of
hours during which the capacity constraint is being operated. This is because it is not
possible to speed up the constrained operation, resulting in the permanent loss of any
units that are not produced. For example, if the monthly operating expenses of a
facility are $1.2 million and the constrained resource is run for every hour of that
month, or 720 hours (30 days x 24 hours/day), then the cost per hour of the operation
is $1,667 ($1,200,000 divided by 720 hours). Given this much higher cost of not
running the operation, a manager will be much more likely to find a replacement
operator for break periods.

Thus, knowing the substantial cost of not running a constrained resource is
extremely important when determining how much capital funding should be allocated
to that resource.

2-3 HOW DO I IDENTIFY A CONSTRAINED RESOURCE?

 

The constrained resource may not be immediately apparent, especially in a large
production environment with many products, routings, and work centers. It is this
“noise in the system”’ that prevents us from easily identifying constraints. Here are
some questions to ask that will help locate it:

¢ Where is there a work backlog? If there is an area where work virtually never
catches up with demand, where expeditors are constantly hovering, and where
there are large quantities of inventory piled up, this is a likely constraint
area.

¢ Where do most problems originate? Management usually finds itself hovering
around only a small number of work centers whose problems never seem to go
away. Continuing problems are common at constrained resources, because they
are so heavily utilized that there is never enough time to perform a sufficient level
of maintenance, resulting in recurring breakdowns. In addition, there tends to be a
fight over work priorities when there is not sufficient capacity, which also means
that managers will be regularly called upon to determine these priorities among
competing orders.

¢ Where are the expediters? An expediter physically steers a high-priority
job through the production process. Because they frequently wait while their


48 Management Accounting Best Practices

assigned jobs are being processed, their presence (especially several of them
together) is a good indicator of a bottleneck where they must wait for available
production time.

¢ Which work centers have high utilization? Many companies measure the utiliza-
tion level of their work centers. If so, review the list to determine which ones have
a continually high level of utilization over multiple months. If a work center only
briefly attains high utilization, it could still be the constraint if the reason for the
lower utilization is ongoing maintenance problems or employee absenteeism.

* What happens to total throughput when the constraint capacity changes? If we
add to the capacity of the suspected constraint, is there a noticeable increase in
throughput? Conversely, if we deliberately reduce the capacity of the targeted
work center (not recommended as a testing technique!), does overall throughput
decline? If throughput does alter as a result of these changes, then we have
probably located the constrained resource.

If, after this analysis, a company picks the wrong operation as its constrained
resource, the real constraint will soon appear because of changes in the inventory
buffers in front of the real and fake constraints. If the real constraint is upstream from
the fake constraint, then the inventory buffer in front of the fake constraint will
disappear. This happens because management will focus its attention on improving
the efficiency of the fake resource, thereby wiping out its backlog of work. The real
constraint will be readily apparent, because it still has an inventory backlog.
Conversely, if the real constraint is downstream from the fake constraint, then a
larger inventory backlog will build in front of it. This happens because the same
improvement in efficiency at the fake resource will result in a flood of additional
inventory heading downstream, where it will dam up at the real constraint.

If products are engineered to order, then consider the engineering department to be
part of the production process. This is important from the perspective of locating the
constraint, because the constraint may not be in the traditional production area at all,
but rather in the engineering department. Similarly, and for all types of product sales,
the constraint may also reside in the sales department, where there may not be enough
staff available to convert a large proportion of sales prospects into orders. This
constraint is most evident when there are clearly many sales prospects at the top of the
sales funnel, but there is a choke point somewhere in the sales conversion process,
below which few orders are received. If this is the case, the solution is to enhance
staffing for the sales positions specifically needed to improve handling of sales
prospects at the choke point in the sales funnel.

Another constraint can also be raw materials. This problem arises during periods
of excessive industry demand, resulting in materials allocations from suppliers. The
location of this constraint will be immediately apparent to the materials management
staff, which will have to reschedule production based on the shortage. However, this
problem tends to be a short-term one, after which the constraint shifts back from the
supplier and into the company.


2-5 Should | Increase Sprint Capacity? 49

It is also possible to designate a work center as the constrained resource. Taking
this proactive approach is most useful when a work center requires a great deal of
additional investment or highly skilled staffing to increase its capacity. By requiring
that the constraint be focused on this area, management can profitably spend its time
ensuring that the work center is fully utilized. It is also useful to avoid positioning the
constraint on a resource that requires considerable management to operate properly,
such as one where employee training or turnover levels are extremely high. Thus,
positioning the constrained resource can be a management decision, rather than an
incidental occurrence.

2-4 WHEN SHOULD | INVEST IN A CONSTRAINED
RESOURCE?

 

At what point should a company invest in more of the constrained resource? In many
cases, the company has specifically designated a resource to be its constraint, because
it is so expensive to add more capacity, so this decision is not to be taken lightly. The
decision process is to review the impact on the incremental change in throughput
caused by the added investment, less any changes in operating expenses. Because this
type of investment represents a considerable step cost (where costs and/or the
investment will jump considerably as a result of the decision), management must
usually make its decision based on the perceived level of long-term throughput
changes, rather than smaller expected short-term throughput increases.

2-5 SHOULD | INCREASE SPRINT CAPACITY?

 

Sprint capacity is excess capacity built into a production operation that allows
the facility to create excess inventory in the short term, usually to make up for
sudden shortfalls in inventory levels. Sprint capacity is extremely useful for main-
taining a sufficient flow of inventory into the constrained resource, since the system
can quickly recover from a production shortfall. If there is a great deal of sprint
capacity in a production system, then there is less need for an inventory buffer in
front of the constrained resource, since new inventory stocks can be generated
quickly.

It is not only useful, but necessary to have excess capacity levels available in a
system. This controverts the traditional management approach of eliminating excess
capacity in order to reduce the costs associated with maintaining that capacity.
Instead, management should invest in nonconstraint resources when those resources
have so little excess capacity that they have difficulty recovering from downtime. This
can be a major problem if the lack of capacity constantly places the constrained
resource in danger of running out of work. In this case, a good investment alternative is
to invest in a sufficient amount of additional sprint capacity to ensure that the system
can rapidly recover from a reasonable level of downtime. If a manager is applying fora


50 Management Accounting Best Practices

capital investment based on this reasoning, he should attach to the proposal a chart
showing the capacity level at which the targeted resource has been operating over the
past few months, as well as the amount of downtime this has caused at the constrained
resource.

Most companies do not experience a sudden increase in product sales; rather, they
are subject to a slow, steady increase in demand that gradually fills the available
amount of capacity throughout the production area. When this happens, management
attention is rightly focused on maintaining a high level of throughput at the con-
strained resource. However, the increased demand also tends to gradually absorb
excess capacity levels elsewhere in the plant. If this phenomenon continues for some
time, management may be blindsided by what appears to be a sudden decrease in
sprint capacity.

If sprint capacity declines to an excessive extent, it is likely that occasional
upstream production problems will eventually result in shortages at the constraint and
a reduction of throughput. To guard against the onset of this creeping reduction in
capacity, the accountant should monitor nonconstraint usage levels, and warn man-
agement when there is a long-term reduction of sprint capacity that is not abating. This
may very well call for additional capital investments in order to maintain a sufficient
level of sprint capacity.

2-6 HOW CLOSELY SHOULD | LINK CAPITAL
EXPENDITURES TO STRATEGY?

 

Companies tend not to spend money where their strategies indicate they should spend
it. Instead, they tend to support their existing infrastructures with continuing invest-
ments in those areas. This tendency is largely due to the way in which the capital
budgeting approval process is structured, whereby the managers in charge of this
infrastructure are responsible not only for submitting capital requests, but also for
approving them. The inevitable result is that the managers of new business units that
are more closely tied to the company’s long-term strategy will find themselves
crowded out in the competition to obtain a limited amount of corporate funding.
Another form of evidence of this tendency is when a company continually increases
its asset base in an existing business in order to increase its efficiency levels, while
competition forces its prices downward. The result is an inferior or negative return on
investment.

A greatly preferable alternative is to have the senior management team that is
responsible for setting strategy also be solely responsible for allocating funding to the
various capital requests. By doing so, a company can more readily focus its capital
funding on those potentially large markets with good growth rates, and in which the
company stands the best chance of competing. From a purely financial perspective,
this means that the company will be investing where its return on investments exceeds
its cost of capital by the greatest amount, and eliminating assets where the return is
negative.


2-8 Should | Judge Capital Proposals? 51

2-7 WHAT FORMAT SHOULD | USE FOR A CAPITAL
REQUEST FORM?

 

The summary-level capital budgeting form shown in Exhibit 2.2 splits capital budget-
ing requests into three categories: (1) constraint-related, (2) risk-related, and (3) non-
constraint-related. The risk-related category covers all capital purchases for which
the company must meet a legal requirement, or for which there is a perception that the
company is subject to an undue amount of risk if it does not invest in an asset. All
remaining requests that do not clearly fall into the constraint-related or risk-related
categories drop into a catchall category at the bottom of the form. The intent of this
format is to clearly differentiate among various types of approval requests, with each
one requiring different types of analysis and management approval.

The approval levels vary significantly in the throughput-based capital request
form. Approvals for constraint-related investments include a process analyst (who
verifies that the request will actually impact the constraint), as well as generally
higher-dollar approval levels for lower-level managers—the intent is to make it easier
to approve capital requests that will improve the constrained resource. Approvals for
risk-related projects first require the joint approval of the corporate attorney and chief
risk officer, with added approvals for large expenditures. Finally, the approvals for
non-constraint-related purchases involve lower-dollar approval levels, so the approval
process is intentionally made more difficult.

Once approved as part of the budgeting process, capital requests can be segregated
in the budget into the three categories just noted. The basic format of this portion of the
budget is shown in Exhibit 2.3.

The capital budget example shows more expenditures for risk-related projects, but
in most cases the bulk of funding should be focused squarely on constraint-related
projects, with only minimal funding reserved for non-constraint-related projects.
Also, the example contains an additional section at the bottom, in which is listed the
incremental additional capacity of the constrained resource resulting from the new
investments. In this section, the new capacity is listed with a time delay, so that a
capital expenditure is fully installed before the resulting capacity is assumed to be
available. Though most of the budget contains nothing but financial information, this
operational information may have an impact on the company’s ability to increase its
sales later in the budget period, and so is extremely useful reference information.

2-8 SHOULD | JUDGE CAPITAL PROPOSALS BASED ON
THEIR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS?

 

The traditional capital budgeting approach involves having the management team
review a series of unrelated requests from throughout the company, each one asking
for funding for various projects. Management decides whether to fund each request
based on the discounted cash flows projected for each one. If there are not sufficient
funds available for all requests having positive discounted cash flows, then those with

the largest cash flows or highest percentage returns are usually accepted first, until the

funds run out.

There are several problems with this type of capital budgeting. First and most
important, there is no consideration of how each requested project fits into the entire
system of production—instead, most requests involve the local optimization of
specific work centers that may not contribute to the total throughput of the company.
Second, there is no consideration of the constrained resource, so managers cannot tell
which funding requests will result in an improvement to the efficiency of that


54 Management Accounting Best Practices

operation. Third, managers tend to engage in a great deal of speculation regarding the
budgeted cash flows resulting from their requests, resulting in inaccurate discounted
cash flow projections. Since many requests involve unverifiable cash flow estimates, it
is impossible to discern which projects are better than others.

A greater reliance on throughput accounting concepts eliminates most of these
problems. In particular, the priority for funding should be placed squarely on any
projects that can improve the capacity of the constrained resource, based on a
comparison of the incremental additional throughput created with the incremental
operating expenses and investment incurred.

Nonetheless, many companies have a long tradition of using discounted cash flows
to determine which capital requests are to be accepted. If so, then at least include
constraint analysis in the overall approval process, which may skew some funding
allocations in favor of bottleneck operations that require additional capacity.

2-9 HOW DO I CALCULATE THE COST OF CAPITAL?

 

A company’s cost of capital is used to discount the net present value of cash flows
projected for prospective projects, and so is a key part of the capital budgeting process.
The cost of capital is comprised of three elements, which are the costs of debt,
preferred stock, and common stock.

When calculating the cost of debt, it is important to remember that the interest
expense is tax deductible. This means that the tax paid by the company is reduced by
the tax rate multiplied by the interest expense. An example is shown in Exhibit 2.4,
where we assume that $1,000,000 of debt has a basic interest rate of 9.5 percent, and
the corporate tax rate is 35 percent.

Ifa company is not currently turning a profit, and therefore not in a position to pay
taxes, one may question whether the company should factor the impact of taxes into
the interest calculation. The answer is still yes, because any net loss will carry forward
to the next reporting period, when the company can offset future earnings against the
accumulated loss to avoid paying taxes at that time. Thus, the reduction in interest
costs caused by the tax deductibility of interest is still applicable even if a company is
not currently in a position to pay income taxes.

Another issue is the cost of acquiring debt, and how this cost should be factored
into the overall cost of debt calculation. When obtaining debt, there are usually extra
fees involved, which may include placement or brokerage fees, documentation fees,
or the price of a bank audit. In the case of a private placement, the company may set a
fixed percentage interest payment on the debt, but find that prospective borrowers will
not purchase the debt instruments unless they can do so at a discount, thereby
effectively increasing the interest rate they will earn on the debt. In both cases, the
company is receiving less cash than initially expected, but must still pay out the same
amount of interest expense. In effect, this raises the cost of the debt. To carry forward
the example in Exhibit 2.4 to Exhibit 2.5, we assume that the interest payments are the
same, but that brokerage fees were $25,000 and that the debt was sold at a 2 percent
discount. The result is an increase in the actual interest rate.

The cost of preferred stock is treated differently from debt, because under the tax
laws, interest payments are treated as dividends instead of interest expense, which
means that these payments are not tax deductible. This is a key issue, for it greatly
increases the cost of funds for any company using preferred stock as a funding source.
By way of comparison, if a company has a choice between issuing debt or preferred
stock at the same rate, the difference in cost will be the tax savings on the debt. In the
following example, a company issues $1,000,000 of debt and $1,000,000 of preferred
stock, both at 9 percent interest rate, with an assumed 35 percent tax rate.

Debt cost = Principal x (Interest rate x (1 — tax rate))
Debt cost = $1,000,000 x (9% x (1 — .35))
$58, 500 = $1,000,000 x (9% x .65)

If the same information is used to calculate the cost of payments using preferred
stock, we have the following result:

Preferred stock interest cost = Principal x Interest rate
Preferred stock interest cost = $1,000,000 x 9%
$90,000 = $1,000,000 x 9%


56 Management Accounting Best Practices

The final component of the cost of capital is common stock. The usual method for
developing its cost is the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). The CAPM essentially
derives the cost of capital by determining the relative risk of holding the stock of a
specific company as compared with a mix of all stocks in the market. This risk is
composed of three elements:

1. The return that any investor can expect from a risk-free investment. This is
usually defined as the return on a U.S. government security.

2. The return from a set of securities considered to have an average level of
risk. This can be the average return on a large market basket of stocks, such as the
Standard & Poor’s 500, the Dow Jones Industrials, or some other large cluster of
stocks.

3. The company’s beta, which defines the amount by which a specific stock’s returns
vary from the returns of stocks with an average risk level. This information is
provided by several of the major investment services, such as Value Line. A beta
of 1.0 means that a specific stock is exactly as risky as the average stock, while
a beta of 0.8 would represent a lower level of risk and a beta of 1.4 would be
higher.

When combined, this information yields the baseline return to be expected on any
investment (the risk-free return), plus an added return that is based on the level of risk
that an investor is assuming by purchasing a specific stock.

The calculation of the equity cost of capital using the CAPM methodology is
relatively simple, once one has accumulated all the components of the equation. For
example, if the risk-free cost of capital is 5 percent, the return on the Dow Jones
Industrials is 12 percent, and ABC Company’s beta is 1.5, the cost of equity for ABC
Company would be:

Cost of equity capital = Risk-free return + Beta (Average stock
return — risk-free return)
Cost of equity capital = 5% + 1.5(12% — 5%)
Cost of equity capital = 5% + 1.5 x 7%
Cost of equity capital = 5% + 10.5%
Cost of equity capital = 15.5%

Now that we have derived the costs of debt, preferred stock, and common stock, we
can assemble all three costs into a weighted cost of capital. The following example
shows the method by which the weighted cost of capital of the Canary Corporation is
calculated.

The chief financial officer of the Canary Corporation, Mr. Birdsong, is interested
in determining the company’s weighted cost of capital. There are two debt offerings
on the books. The first is $1,000,000 that was sold below par value, which garnered
$980,000 in cash proceeds. The company must pay interest of 8.5 percent on this debt.
The second is for $3,000,000 and was sold at par, but included legal fees of $25,000.


2-9 How Do | Calculate the Cost of Capital? 57

The interest rate on this debt is 10 percent. There is also $2,500,000 of preferred stock
on the books, which requires annual interest (or dividend) payments amounting to
9 percent of the amount contributed to the company by investors. Finally, there is
$4,000,000 of common stock on the books. The risk-free rate of interest, as defined by
the return on current U.S. government securities, is 6 percent, while the return
expected from a typical market basket of related stocks is 12 percent. The company’s
beta is 1.2, and it currently pays income taxes at a marginal rate of 35 percent. What is
the Canary Company’s weighted cost of capital?

The method we will use is to separately compile the percentage cost of each form
of funding, and then calculate the weighted cost of capital, based on the amount of
funding and percentage cost of each of the above forms of funding. We begin with the
first debt item, which was $1,000,000 of debt that was sold for $20,000 less than par
value, at 8.5 percent debt. The marginal income tax rate is 35 percent. The calculation
is as follows.

((Interest expense) x (1 — tax rate)) x Amount of debt
Net after-tax interest percent = --------------------------------------
(Amount of debt) — (Discount on sale of debt)
((8.5%) x (1 — .35)) x $1,000,000
Net after-tax interest percent = --------------------------------------
$1,000,000 — $20,000
Net after-tax interest percent = 5.638%

 

We employ the same method for the second debt instrument, for which there is
$3,000,000 of debt that was sold at par: $25,000 in legal fees were incurred to place
the debt, which pays 10 percent interest. The marginal income tax rate remains at
35 percent. The calculation is as follows:

((Interest expense) x (1 — tax rate)) x Amount of debt
Net after-tax interest percent = -----------------------------------
(Amount of debt) — (Discount on sale of debt)
((10%) x (1 — .35)) x $3,000,000
Net after-tax interest percent = -----------------------------------
$3,000,000 — $25,000
Net after-tax interest percent = 7.091%

 

We now calculate the cost of the preferred stock. As noted above, there is
$2,500,000 of preferred stock on the books, with an interest rate of 9 percent.
The marginal corporate income tax does not apply, since the interest payments
are treated like dividends, and are not deductible. The calculation is the simplest
of all, for the answer is 9 percent, since there is no income tax to confuse the
issue.

Exhibit 2.6 The Weighted Cost of Capital Calculation

 

 

Type of Funding Amount of Funding Percentage Cost Dollar Cost
Debt number | $980,000 5.638% $55,252

Common stock 4,000,000 13.200% 528,000
Totals $10,455,000 9.75% $1,019,209

 

To arrive at the cost of equity capital, we take from the example a return on risk-
free securities of 6 percent, a return of 12 percent that is expected from a typical
market basket of related stocks, and a beta of 1.2. We then enter this information into
the following formula to arrive at the cost of equity capital:

Cost of equity capital = Risk-free return + Beta (Average stock
return — risk-free return)
Cost of equity capital = 6% + 1.2 (12% — 6%)
Cost of equity capital = 13.2%
Now that we know the cost of each type of funding, it is a simple matter to construct
a table such as the one shown in Exhibit 2.6 that lists the amount of each type of fund-
ing and its related cost, which we can quickly sum to arrive at a weighted cost of capital.
When combined into the weighted average calculation shown in Exhibit 2.6, we see
that the weighted cost of capital is 9.75 percent. Though there is some considerably less
expensive debt on the books, the majority of the funding is comprised of more
expensive common and preferred stock, which drives up the overall cost of capital.

2-10 WHEN SHOULD | USE THE INCREMENTAL
COST OF CAPITAL?

 

The trouble with the existing weighted cost of capital is that it reflects the cost of debt
and equity only at the time the company obtained it. For example, if a company
obtained debt at a fixed interest rate during a period in the past when the prime rate
offered by banks for new debt was very high, the resulting cost of capital, which still
includes this debt, will be higher than the cost of capital if that debt had been retired
and refunded by new debt that was obtained at current market rates, which are lower.
The same issue applies to equity, for the cost of equity can change if the underlying
return on risk-free debt has changed, which it does continually (just observe daily or
monthly swings in the cost of U.S. government securities, which are considered to be
risk-free). Similarly, a company’s beta will change over time as its overall risk profile
changes, possibly due to changes in its markets, or internal changes that alter its mix of
business. Accordingly, a company may find that its carefully calculated weighted cost
of capital does not bear even a slight resemblance to what the same cost would be if
recalculated based on current market conditions.


2-10 When Should | Use the Incremental Cost of Capital? 59

Where does this disturbing news leave us? If there is no point in using the weighted
cost of capital that is recorded on the books, there is no reason why we cannot calculate
the incremental weighted cost of capital based on current market conditions, and use
that as a hurdle rate instead. By doing so, a company recognizes that it will obtain
funds at the current market rates, and use the cost of this blended rate to pay for new
projects. For example, if a company intends to retain the same proportions of debt and
equity, and finds that the new weighted cost of capital is 2 percent higher at current
market rates than the old rates recorded on the company books, then the hurdle rate
used for evaluating new projects should use the new, higher rate.

It is also important to determine management’s intentions in regard to the new
blend of debt and equity, for changes in the proportions of the two will alter the
weighted cost of capital. If a significant alteration in the current mix is anticipated, the
new proportion should be factored into the weighted cost of capital calculation. For
example, management may be forced by creditors or owners to alter the existing
proportion of debt and equity. This is most common when a company is closely held,
and the owners do not want to invest any more equity in the company, thereby forcing
it to resort to debt financing. Alternatively, if the debt-to-equity ratio is very high,
lenders may force the addition of more equity in order to reduce the risk of default,
which goes up when there is a large amount of interest and principal to pay out of
current cash flow. In short, the incremental cost of capital is the most relevant hurdle
rate figure when using new funds to pay for new projects.

The concept of incremental funds costs can be taken too far, however. If acompany
is initiating only one project in the upcoming year and needs to borrow funds at a
specific rate to pay for it, then a good case can be made for designating the cost of that
funding as the hurdle rate for the single project under consideration, since the two are
inextricably intertwined. However, such a direct relationship is rarely the case.
Instead, there are many projects being implemented, which are spread out over a
long time frame, with funds being acquired at intervals that do not necessarily match
those of the funds requirements of individual projects. For example, a company may
hold off on an equity offering in the public markets until there is a significant upswing
in the stock market, or borrow funds a few months early if it can obtain a favorably low,
long-term fixed rate. When this happens, there is no way to tie a specific funding cost
to a specific project, so it is better to calculate the blended cost of capital for the period
and apply it as a hurdle rate to all of the projects currently under consideration.

All this discussion of the incremental cost of capital does not mean that the cost of
capital that is derived from the book cost of existing funding is totally irrelevant—far
from it. Many companies finance all new projects out of their existing cash flow, and
have no reason to go to outside lenders or equity markets to obtain new funding. For
these organizations, the true cost of debt is indeed the same as the amount recorded on
their books, since they are obligated to pay that exact amount of debt, irrespective of
what current market interest rates may be. However, the weighted cost of capital does
not just include debt; it also includes equity, and this cost does change over time. Even
if a company has no need for additional equity, the cost of its existing equity will
change, because the earnings expectations of investors will change over time, as


60 Management Accounting Best Practices

well as the company’s beta. For example, the underlying risk-free interest rate can and
will change as the inflation rate varies, so there is some return to investors that exceeds
the rate of inflation. Similarly, the average market rate of return on equity will change
over time as investor expectations change. Further, the mix of businesses and markets
in which a company is involved will inevitably lead to variation in its beta over time, as
the variability of its cash flows becomes greater or lower. Consequently, the book cost
of debt is still a valid part of the weighted cost of capital as long as no new debt is
added, whereas the cost of equity will change as the expectation for higher or lower
returns by investors changes, which results in a weighted cost of capital that can blend
the book and market costs of funding in some situations.

2-11 HOW DO | USE NET PRESENT VALUE
IN CAPITAL BUDGETING?

 

The typical capital investment is composed of a string of cash flows, both in and out,
that will continue until the investment is eventually liquidated at some point in the
future. These cash flows are comprised of many things: the initial payment for
equipment, continuing maintenance costs, salvage value of the equipment when it is
eventually sold, tax payments, receipts from product sold, and so on. The trouble is,
since the cash flows are coming in and going out over a period of many years, how do
we make them comparable for an analysis that is done in the present? This requires the
use of a discount rate (usually based on the cost of capital) to reduce the value of a
future cash flow into what it would be worth right now. By applying the discount rate to
each anticipated cash flow, we can reduce and then add them together, which yields a
single combined figure that represents the current value of the entire proposed capital
investment. This is known as its net present value.

For an example of how net present value works, Exhibit 2.7 lists the cash flows,
both in and out, for a capital investment that is expected to last for five years. The year
is listed in the first column, the amount of the cash flow in the second column, and
the discount rate in the third column. The final column multiplies the cash flow

from the second column by the discount rate in the third column to yield the present
value of each cash flow. The grand total cash flow is listed in the lower-right corner of
the table.

Notice that the discount factor in Exhibit 2.7 becomes progressively smaller in
later years, since cash flows further in the future are worth less than those that will be
received sooner. The discount factor is published in present value tables, which are
listed in many accounting and finance textbooks. They are also a standard feature in
midrange hand-held calculators. Another variation is to use the following formula to
manually compute a present value:

Present value of (Future cash flow)
a future cash flow ( + Discount rate) (Squared by the number of periods of discounting)

 

 

Using the above formula, if we expect to receive $75,000 in one year, and the
discount rate is 15 percent, then the calculation is:

$75, 000

(1 +.15)!
Present value = $65, 217.39

Present value =

Here are the most common cash flow line items to include in a net present value
analysis:

* Cash inflows from sales. If a capital investment results in added sales, then all
gross margins attributable to that investment must be included in the analysis.

* Cash inflows and outflows for equipment purchases and sales. There should be a
cash outflow when a product is purchased, as well as a cash inflow when the
equipment is no longer needed and is sold off.

* Cash inflows and outflows for working capital. When a capital investment
occurs, it normally involves the use of some additional inventory. If there are
added sales, then there will probably be additional accounts receivable. In either
case, these are additional investments that must be included in the analysis as cash
outflows. Also, if the investment is ever terminated, then the inventory will
presumably be sold off and the accounts receivable collected, so there should be
line items in the analysis, located at the end of the project timeline, showing the
cash inflows from the liquidation of working capital.

* Cash outflows for maintenance. If there is production equipment involved, then
there will be periodic maintenance needed to ensure that it runs properly.

* Cash outflows for taxes. If there is a profit from new sales that are attributable to
the capital investment, then the incremental income tax that can be traced to those
incremental sales must be included in the analysis. Also, if there is a significant


62 Management Accounting Best Practices

quantity of production equipment involved, the annual personal property taxes
that can be traced to that equipment should also be included.

* Cash inflows for the tax effect of depreciation. Depreciation is an allowable tax
deduction. Accordingly, the depreciation created by the purchase of capital
equipment should be offset against the cash outflow caused by income taxes.
Though depreciation is really just an accrual, it does have a net cash flow impact
caused by a reduction in taxes, and so should be included in the net present value
calculation.

The net present value approach is the best way to see if a proposed capital
investment has a sufficient rate of return to justify the use of any required funds.
Also, because it reveals the amount of cash created in excess of the cost of capital,
it allows management to rank projects by the amount of cash they can potentially
spin off.

2-12 WHAT PROPOSAL FORM SHOULD | REQUIRE FOR
A CASH FLOW ANALYSIS?

 

Department managers are responsible for assembling all the cash flow informa-
tion needed for the accountant to create a net present value analysis. They should
use a standard application form, such as the one shown in Exhibit 2.8, so that the
same types of information are consistently used to arrive at net present value
results.

The form shown in Exhibit 2.8 is divided into several key pieces. The first is the
identification section, in which we insert the name of the project sponsor, the date
on which the proposal was submitted, and the description of the project. For a
company that deals with a multitude of capital projects, it may also be useful to
include a specific identifying code for each one. The next section is the most
important one—it lists all cash inflows and outflows, in summary form, for each
year. The sample form has room for just five years of cash flows, but this can be
increased for companies with longer-term investments. Cash outflows are listed as
negative numbers, and inflows as positive ones. The annual depreciation figure
goes into the box in the “Tax Effect of Annual Depreciation’ column. The column
of tax deductions listed directly below the depreciation box are automatic
calculations that determine the tax deduction, based on the tax rate noted in
the far-right column. All of the cash flows for each year are then summarized in the
far-right column. A series of calculations are listed directly below this “Total”
column, which itemize the payback period and net present value. This can be
considered a risky project, since the net present value is negative and the number of
years needed to pay back the initial investment is quite lengthy. The next section of
the form is for the type of project. The purpose of this section is to identify those
investments that must be completed, irrespective of the rate of return; these are

usually due to legal or safety issues. Also, if a project is for a new product,
management may consider it to be especially risky, and so will require a higher
hurdle rate. This section identifies those projects. The last section is for approvals
by managers. It lists the level of manager who can sign off on various investment

each investment. This format is comprehensive enough to give an accountant
sufficient information to conduct a rapid analysis of most projects.

2-13 SHOULD | USE THE PAYBACK PERIOD
IN CAPITAL BUDGETING?

 

The net present value method shown earlier misses one important element, which is that
it does not fully explain investment risk, which is the chance that the initial investment
will not be earned back, or that the rate of return target will not be met. Discounting can
be used to identify or weed out such projects, simply by increasing the hurdle rate. For
example, if. project is perceived to be risky, an increase in the hurdle rate will reduce its
net present value, which makes the investment less likely to be approved by manage-
ment. However, management may not be comfortable dealing with discounted cash
flow methods when looking at a risky investment; they just want to know how long it
will take until they get their invested funds back—the payback period.

There are two ways to calculate the payback period. The first method is the
easiest to use, but can yield a skewed result. That calculation is to divide the capital
investment by the average annual cash flow from operations. For example, in
Exhibit 2.9 we have a stream of cash flows over five years that is heavily weighted
toward the time periods that are furthest in the future. The sum of those cash flows is
$8,750,000, which is an average of $1,750,000 per year. We will also assume that the
initial capital investment was $6,000,000. Based on this information, the payback
period is $6,000,000 divided by $1,750,000, which is 3.4 years. However, if we review
the stream of cash flows in Exhibit 2.9, it is evident that the cash inflow did not cover
the investment at the 3.4-year mark. In fact, the actual cash inflow did not exceed
$6,000,000 until shortly after the end of the fourth year. What happened? The stream
of cash flows in the example was so skewed toward future periods that the annual
average cash flow was not representative of the annual actual cash flow. Thus, we can
use the averaging method only if the stream of future cash flows is relatively even from
year to year.

The most accurate way to calculate the payback period is to do so manually. This
means that we deduct the total expected cash inflow from the invested balance, year by
year, until we arrive at the correct period. For example, we have recreated the stream

of cash flows from Exhibit 2.9 in Exhibit 2.10, but now with an extra column that
shows the net capital investment remaining at the end of each year. We can use this
format to reach the end of year 4; we know that the cash flows will pay back the
investment sometime during year 5, but we do not have a month-by-month cash flow
that tells us precisely when. Instead, we can assume an average stream of cash flows
during that period, which works out to $250,000 per month ($3,000,000 cash inflow
for the year, divided by 12 months). Since there was only $250,000 of net investment
remaining at the end of the fourth year, and this is the same monthly amount of cash
flow in the fifth year, we can assume that the payback period is 4.1 years.

2-14 HOW CAN A POST-COMPLETION
ANALYSIS HELP ME?

 

The greatest failing in most capital review systems is not in the initial analysis phase,
but in the post-completion phase, because there isn’t one. The accountant usually puts
a great deal of effort into compiling a capital investment proposal form, educating
managers about how to use it, and then setting up control points around the system to
ensure that all capital requestors make use of the approval system. However, if there is
no methodology for verifying that managers enter accurate information into the
approval forms, which is done by comparing actual results to them, then managers
will eventually figure out that they can alter the numbers in the approval forms in order
to beat the corporate hurdle rates, even if this information is incorrect. However, if
managers know that their original estimates will be carefully reviewed and critiqued
for some time into the future, then they will be much more careful in completing their
initial capital requests. Thus, analysis at the back end of a capital project will lead to
greater accuracy at the front end.

Analysis of actual expenditures can begin before a capital investment is fully paid
for or installed. The accountant can subtotal the payments made by the end of each
month and compare them with the total projected by the project manager. A total that
significantly exceeds the approved expenditure would then be grounds for an immedi-
ate review by top management. This approach works best for the largest capital


66 Management Accounting Best Practices

expenditures, where reviewing payment data in detail is worth the extra effort by the
accounting staff if it can prevent large overpayments. It is also worthwhile when
capital expenditures cover long periods of time, so that a series of monthly reviews can
be made.

Once a project is completed, there may be cash inflows that result from it. If so, a
quarterly comparison of actual with projected cash inflows is the most frequent
comparison to be made, with an annual review being sufficient in many cases. Such a
review keeps management apprised of the performance of all capital projects, and lets
the project sponsors know that their estimates will be the subject of considerable
scrutiny for as far into the future as they had originally projected. For those companies
that survive based on the efficiency of capital usage, it may even be reasonable to tie
manager pay reviews to the accuracy of their capital investment request forms.

An example of a post-completion project analysis is shown in Exhibit 2.11. In this
example, the top of the report compares actual with budgeted cash outflows, while the
middle compares all actual cash outflows with the budget. Note that the cash outflows
section is complete, since these were all incurred at the beginning of the project,
whereas the inflows section is not yet complete, because the project has completed
only the third year of a five-year plan. To cover the remaining two years of activity,
there is a column for estimated cash inflows, which projects them for the remaining
years of the investment, using the last year in which there is actual data available. This
projected information can be used to determine the net present value. We compare the
actual and projected net present values at the bottom of the report, so that management
can see if there are any problems worthy of correction. In this case, the initial costs
of the project, both in terms of capital items and working capital, were so far over
budget that the actual net present value is solidly in the red. In this case, management

2-15 What Factors Should | Consider for a Site Selection? 67

should take a hard look at reducing the working capital, since this is the single largest
cash drain in excess of the budget, while also seeing whether cash inflow can be
increased to match the budgeted annual amounts for the last two years of the
investment.

2-15 WHAT FACTORS SHOULD | CONSIDER FOR
A SITE SELECTION?

 

The analysis of a capital request for a site selection is entirely different from the
analysis process for any other type of capital expenditure. Rather than a strict analysis
of constraints or discounted cash flows, this analysis involves the consideration of a
multitude of additional factors, which include the following items:

¢ Local labor force. If the proposed facility requires a great deal of skilled labor,
then the presence of a local university may be a key consideration. Alternatively,
if the facility requires low-cost labor, then this will mandate a location in an
economically depressed area or perhaps in another country with the needed
characteristics. Also, if the sheer quantity of available labor is a factor, then
locating near a population center will be important.

¢ Infrastructure. If the facility requires the transport of extremely bulky or heavy
items, this may mandate a location near a rail siding. In most cases, it will at least
call for locating next to a well-graded road with close access to a highway system
or airfield. The required infrastructure may also call for access to a broadband
communications network.

¢ Suppliers. If the new facility is to be operated on a just-in-time basis, or if supply
chain management is crucial to its success, the company may be forced to locate
near its key suppliers, or alternatively convince them to create facilities near the
new location. The result may be a facility that is equidistant from all key
suppliers.

¢ Weather. The type of business operated by a company may only be possible
under certain weather conditions, such as theme parks that must be open all year.

¢ Local incentives. Local governments may offer a broad array of incentives in
exchange for locating within their jurisdictions. Typical incentives are training
credits, free utility installations, free land, low-interest loans, and inclusions in
economic development zones.

¢ Local tax rates. Irrespective of other incentives offered by local governments,
long-term tax rates may differ so dramatically in some areas that they will have a
significant impact on the expected return from a site location.

Clearly, a vast array of factors must be considered in a site selection—many of
them such a mix of quantitative and qualitative factors that a site selection cannot be
entirely determined through the use of financial analysis. Instead, use some of the


68 Management Accounting Best Practices

quantitative factors outlined here to select a set of finalists, from which management
can pick the winning site based on additional, nonquantitative factors.

One alternative that is generally overlooked is finding extra space in existing
facilities, rather than obtaining entirely new facilities. It is frequently worthwhile to
review existing sites to see how much space can be consolidated, or whether some
items can be shipped off to lower-cost long-term storage. In some cases, it may also be
possible to have employees work from home and use generally available office space
only when they need to be in the office. By using any of these options, the potential
savings could be dramatic.

Credit and Collection
Decisions

The accountant is usually in charge of granting credit to customers, as well as
collecting funds from them. These basic responsibilities give rise to a number of
fundamental credit management questions, such as how to create a credit policy,
where to obtain financial information about customers, how to create a credit
granting system, and when to review existing credit levels. Once credit is granted,
the accountant must then determine the best ways to create and deliver invoices
in a manner that will be most likely to ensure payment, as well as develop a
system for keeping track of overdue invoices and ongoing contacts with customers.
Finally, it is necessary to collect on overdue invoices, which calls for the appro-
priate use of the sales staff in making collections, handling customer deductions,
optimizing the use of the collections staff, and involving legal assistance when
necessary.

This chapter provides answers to all of these key questions. The following
table itemizes the section number in which the answers to each question can be
found:

3-1 HOW DO | CREATE AND MAINTAIN A CREDIT POLICY?

 

One of the chief causes of confusion not only within the credit department but
also between the credit and sales departments is the lack of consistency in dealing
with customer credit issues. This includes who is responsible for credit tasks,
what logical structure is used to evaluate and assign credit, what terms of sale are
used, and what milestones are established for the collection process. Without
consistent application of these items, customers never know what credit levels they
are likely to be assigned, collection activities tend to jolt from one step to the next
in no predetermined order, and no one knows who is responsible for what
activities.

Establishment of a reasonably detailed credit policy goes a long way toward
resolving these issues. The policy should clearly state the mission and goals of the
credit department, exactly which positions are responsible for the most critical
credit and collection tasks, what formula shall be used for assigning credit levels,
and what steps shall be followed in the collection process. Further comments are as
follows:

¢ Mission. The mission statement should outline the general concept of how the
credit department does business: Does it provide a loose credit policy to
maximize sales, or work toward high-quality receivables (implying reduced
sales), or manage credit at some point in between? A loose credit policy might
result in this mission: “The credit department shall offer credit to all customers
except those where the risk of loss is probable.”

* Goals. This can be quite specific, describing the exact performance measure-
ments against which the credit staff will be judged. For example, “The depart-
ment goals are to operate with no more than one collections person per 1,000
customers, while attaining a bad debt percentage no higher than 2 percent of
sales, and annual days sales outstanding of no higher than 42 days.”

¢ Responsibilities. This is perhaps the most critical part of the policy, based on the
number of quarrels it can avert. It should firmly state who has final authority over
the granting of credit and the assignment of credit hold status. This is normally
the credit manager, but the policy can also state the order volume level at which
someone else, such as the CFO or treasurer, can be called upon to render final
judgment.

¢ Credit level assignment. This section may be of extreme interest to the sales staff,
the size of whose sales (and commissions) is based on it. The policy should at
least state the sources of information to be used in the calculation of a credit limit,
such as credit reports or financial statements, and can also include the minimum
credit level automatically extended to all customers, as well as the criteria used to
grant larger limits.

* Collections methodology. The policy can itemize what collection steps shall be
followed, such as initial calls, customer visits, e-mails, notification of the sales


3-1 How Do | Create and Maintain a Credit Policy? 71

staff, credit holds, and forwarding to a collections agency. This section can be
written in too much detail, itemizing exactly what steps are to be taken after a
certain number of days. This can constrain an active collections staff from taking
unique steps to achieve a collection, so a certain degree of vagueness is
acceptable here.

* Terms of sale. If there are few product lines in a single industry, it is useful to
clearly state a standard payment term, such as a | percent discount if paid in
10 days; otherwise full payment is expected in 30 days. An override policy can be
included, noting a sign-off by the controller or CFO. By doing so, the sales staff
will be less inclined to attempt to gain better terms on behalf of customers.
However, where there are multiple industries served with different customary
credit terms, it may be too complicated to include this verbiage in the credit
policy.

Company management can experience significant losses if it loosens the
credit policy without a good knowledge of the margins it earns on its products.
For example, if it earns only a 10 percent profit on a product that sells for $10 and
extends credit for one unit on that product to a customer who defaults, it has just
incurred a loss of $9 that will require the sale of nine more units to offset the loss.
On the other hand, if the same product had a profit of 50 percent, it would require
the sale of only one more unit to offset the loss on a bad debt. Thus, loosening or
tightening the credit policy can have a dramatic impact on profits when product
margins are low. Consequently, always review product margins before altering
the credit policy.

When economic conditions within an industry worsen, a company whose
credit policy has not changed from a more expansive period will likely find itself
granting more credit than it should, resulting in more bad debts. Similarly, a
restrictive credit policy during a boom period will result in lost sales that go to
competitors. This latter approach is particularly galling over the long term, since
customers may permanently convert to a competitor and not come back, resulting
in lost market share. To prevent these problems, schedule a periodic review of the
credit policy to see when it should be changed to match economic conditions. A
scheduled quarterly review is generally sufficient for this purpose. To prepare for
the meeting, assemble a list of leading indicators for the industry, tracked on a
trend line, that show where the business cycle is most likely to be heading. This
information is most relevant for the company’s industry, rather than the economy
as a whole, since the conditions within some industries can vary substantially from
the general economy. If a company has international operations, then the credit
policy can be tailored to suit the business cycles of specific countries.

Ifa company’s products are subject to rapid obsolescence, a tight credit policy can
result in limited product sales that leave excess quantities on hand that will be
scrapped. In such cases, loosen the credit policy on those inventory items most likely
to become obsolete in the near term. The logic is that, even if inventory is sold to
customers with a questionable ability to pay for the goods, this at least presents higher


72 Management Accounting Best Practices

odds of obtaining payment than if the company throws away the goods. To implement
this approach, keep the credit department informed of the obsolescence status of
inventory items, usually by having the sales, marketing, and logistics staffs flag
potentially obsolete items in the inventory database and giving the credit department
online access to this information. When customers send in orders, the credit staff
accesses this information, verifies the obsolescence status of the items ordered, and
modifies the credit policy as needed.

3-2 WHEN SHOULD | REQUIRE A CREDIT APPLICATION?

 

The credit application function can be a hit-or-miss affair, with some uncertainty
regarding the order volume at which an application is required. This is a particular
problem when a customer places a large number of small orders, none of which
individually are cause for concern, but which in total can represent a serious credit
risk. If the credit department is overwhelmed with work, it may not have the time to
delve into the need for applications, and will be content to let many seemingly smaller
orders pass by with no credit review. A solution for some situations is to require a
completed credit application from all customers, irrespective of order size. This at
least generates all paperwork needed to initiate a credit review, even if the credit staff
does not choose to pursue a complete investigation. This is not a valid best practice
when order sizes are small, since the extra hassle may drive away small customers.
Also, it is not useful when the credit staff is so small that it has no chance of ever
reviewing all the applications.

If a customer has not placed an order recently, its financial situation may have
changed considerably, rendering its previously assigned credit level no longer
valid. This is a particular problem when the customer may be shopping through an
industry to see who will accept an order, and is forced back to the company when
no other suppliers are willing to deal with it anymore. If the company’s credit
department simply dusts off the old credit review and allows the same credit limit,
there could be a bad debt lurking in the immediate future. A solution is to require
customers to complete a new credit application after a preset interval has passed,
such as two years. This represents a significant additional work load for the credit
staff, so require it only if the old credit level was a sufficiently high one to
represent a noticeable potential bad debt loss. Though the computer system can be
designed to flag these customers for a credit review when new orders arrive, an
alternative is to simply purge from the accounting database all customers with
whom there has been no business in the past two years. Then, when an order arrives
and the accounting system shows no customer record, the credit staff knows it
needs to get involved.

When customers are delinquent in paying, it is common to see their receivable
balances exceed their credit limits, especially when a company has a tight credit
policy and grants only moderate credit limits. In these cases, the collections staff
must constantly contact customers to hound them about payments. The usual threat


3-3 How Do | Obtain Financial Information About Customers? 73

is that all new orders will be held until the customers pay enough to bring the
outstanding balance sufficiently below the credit limit for them to place more
orders. This is a time-consuming and repetitive process. A simple alternative is a
standard mailing to customers having exceeded the credit limit, telling them of the
overage problem, and that they now have to fill out a new credit application in
order to have the chance of obtaining a new, higher credit limit. If the attached
credit application is sufficiently bulky, customers may very well choose to make a
payment rather than go through the ordeal of another credit application. In order to
accelerate this process, consider converting the credit application into PDF format
and e-mailing it to the customer.

3-3 HOW DO | OBTAIN FINANCIAL INFORMATION
ABOUT CUSTOMERS?

 

When a customer calls to ask for a delivery on credit, the credit department is
operating from a clean slate—it has no idea whether the information the customer
enters into a credit application is correct. Though a painstaking amount of labor
can eventually verify this information, there is a large time penalty required
to do so. Meanwhile, customers must wait for the application to be completed,
which may take days, sending frustrated customers elsewhere. One solution is to
purchase credit reports on customers. These reports list company locations, names,
officer information, credit histories, legal problems, banking relations, financial
information, and other data of great use to the credit department. The largest
purveyor of these reports is Dun &Bradstreet (www.dnb.com), followed by
Equifax (www.equifax.com). Report prices range from $40 to $125 for reports
with varying amounts of information, with reduced pricing if one agrees to
purchase a monthly subscription. Low-cost reports include only basic customer
information, such as corporate names, locations, ownership, and corporate history,
while the more expensive reports include a variety of financial and payment
information. Equifax reports present information more graphically, but the two
report providers issue essentially the same information. Both companies provide
credit reports over the Internet.

It is substantially easier to obtain financial information about publicly held
customers. By going to the www.sec.gov Web site, one can easily call up all of
the most recent financial filings submitted by these entities. The best source of
information is the 10-Q report, which details and discusses a company’s quarterly
results. Though a shorter report than the annual 10-K report, it contains much more
current information, and so is of more use to the credit department.

Another source of information is an industry credit group. These groups exchange
information about specific customers, such as recent problems with not-sufficient-
funds (NSF) checks, bankruptcies, accounts being sent to collections, and other
financial difficulties, so the credit department can take quick action to tighten credit
where necessary. The National Association of Credit Management (NACM), which

groups, including the following:

3-4 HOW DOES A CREDIT GRANTING SYSTEM WORK?

 

The credit staff should have a procedure for granting credit that uses a single set of rules
that are not to be violated. The exact procedure will vary by credit department and the
experience of the credit manager. As an example, a credit person can obtain a credit
report for a prospective customer and use this as a source of baseline information for
deriving a credit level. A credit report is an excellent source upon which to create a
standard credit level, for the information contained in it is collected in a similar manner
for all companies, resulting in a standardized and highly comparable basis of
information. Credit reports show the high, low, and median sales levels granted to
a customer by other companies, giving the credit manager some idea of what other
organizations consider to be an appropriate credit range for the customer. However, just
using existing sales levels is not sufficient, since one must also consider the number of
extra days beyond terms that a customer takes to pay its suppliers. This information is a
good indicator of creditworthiness and is also contained in the credit report.

An example of how the “payment” information can be included in the calculation
of acredit level is to take the median credit level other companies granted as a starting
point and then subtract 5 percent of this amount for every day that a customer pays


3-4 How Does a Credit Granting System Work? 75

its suppliers later than standard payment terms. For example, if the median credit
level is $10,000 and a customer pays an average of 10 days late, 50 percent of the
median credit level is taken away, resulting in a revised credit level of $5,000. The
exact system a company uses will be highly dependent on its willingness to incur
credit losses and expend extra effort on collections. A company willing to obtain
more marginal sales will adopt the highest credit level shown in the credit report and
not discount the impact of late payments at all, whereas a risk-averse company may
be inclined to use the lowest reported credit level and further discount it heavily for
the impact of any late payments by the potential customer.

Another example is to set up a system whereby the amount of credit granted is a
percentage of the customer’s reported level of equity. The percentage is calculated by
creating a credit score based on a variety of factors, such as the perceived riskiness of
the country in which the customer is located, the presence of a clean audit report,
positive cash flow, no family members in senior management positions, the possibility
of significant repeat business with the customer, and so on. The exact set of criteria
used will depend upon the industry in which the company is located and fine-tuning of
the system by the credit manager, who maintains it.

Another possibility is to create and consistently use a credit decision table. This is
a simple Yes/No decision matrix based on a few key credit issues. Here is an example
of how a decision table might work:

1. Is the initial order less than $1,000? If so, grant credit without review.

2. Is the initial order more than $1,000 but less than $10,000? Require a completed
credit application. Grant a credit limit of 10 percent of the customer’s net worth.

3. Is the initial order more than $10,000? Require a completed credit application and
financial statements. If a profitable customer, grant a credit limit of 10 percent of
the customer’s net worth. Reduce the credit limit by 10 percent for every percent
of customer loss reported.

4. Does an existing customer’s order exceed its credit limit by less than 20 percent
and there is no history of payment problems? If so, grant the increase.

5. Does an existing customer order exceed its credit limit by more than 20 percent or
there is a history of payment problems? If so, forward to the credit manager for
review. Use the same credit granting process listed in step 3.

6. Does an existing customer have any invoices at least 60 days past due? If so,
freeze all orders.

While this approach does not completely eliminate variability from the credit grant-
ing process, it sets up clear decision points governing what actions to take for the majority
of situations, leaving only the more difficult customer accounts for additional review.

Many companies do not have the resources to create an in-house credit scoring
system for their customers. An alternative is to use the Dun & Bradstreet credit scoring
model, called the “Credit e Valuator Report.” This report contains both a conservative
and aggressive credit limit, a customer’s payment performance trend, basic company
details, and legal filings information. The report costs $35 per customer, with a


76 Management Accounting Best Practices

discount if one purchases a subscription service with Dun & Bradstreet. This is
a good, low-cost approach for determining an approximate credit score, but it does
not include variables that may be of considerable importance in a specific industry.
Also, though the cost per report is low, this is not a sufficiently cost-effective scoring
approach for very small customer accounts.

3-5 WHAT PAYMENT TERMS SHOULD | OFFER
TO CUSTOMERS?

 

The baseline payment terms that a company should consider offering to its customers
is the standard terms offered in the industry, which may range from immediate
payment to 60-day terms. The key issue is to give the appearance of offering
competitive terms, so that prospective customers will not be turned away. However,
it is quite acceptable to modify these baseline terms considerably if a customer
appears to present a credit risk.

One solution is to shorten the terms of sale. For example, a customer may plan to
place 10 orders for $3,000 each within the company’s standard 30-day terms period,
resulting in a required credit line of $30,000. Reducing payment terms to 15 days would
mean that the customer should be able to purchase the same quantity of goods from the
company on a credit line of just $15,000. This approach works only if a customer is
placing many small orders rather than one large one, the orders are evenly spaced out,
and the customer’s own cash receipts cycle allows it to pay on such short terms.

Another possibility is to offer a leasing option to customers, which allows them to
make a series of smaller payments over time. Though the company could offer this
service itself and earn extra interest income on the sale, this still leaves the risk of
collection with the company. An alternative is to engage the services of an outside
leasing firm, so the company receives payment from the lessor as soon as payment is
authorized by the customer, thereby eliminating the collection risk in the shortest
possible time frame. A company can also earn a small interest percentage on the lease
as part of its outsourcing agreement with the leasing company, usually in the range of
¥% to | percent. This approach is most effective when the company and the leasing
agency have come to a joint leasing agreement well in advance of a customer sale, so
the sales staff can present the leasing option to the customer as part of the initial sale
presentation. This frequently gives the company a distinct advantage in making the
sale. Of course, a lease is a viable alternative only when the company is selling a fixed
asset that the customer intends to retain.

Another approach is to leave the payment terms alone, but to have an individual
with personal assets guarantee payment. The personal guarantee makes collection
easier, since the signer knows that he or she is responsible for the amount of the
receivable, and will make sure that this invoice is paid before other unsecured
invoices. If possible, obtain a joint guarantee from the individual and his or her spouse.
By doing so, the company can get around some state-level community property laws
requiring collection only if the spouse also agrees to a guarantee.


3-6 When Should | Review Customer Credit Levels? 77

Finally, consider leaving the payment terms alone, but obtaining credit insurance
on the invoice. This is a guarantee by an insurance company against customer non-
payment. Credit insurance is available for domestic credit, export credit, and coverage
of custom products prior to delivery, in case customers cancel orders. If a credit
insurance policy stipulates a maximum credit limit per customer, the insurance
company must make the decision to increase the credit limit, or the company can
take on the uninsured risk of granting extra credit. If a customer is considered by the
insurance company to be high-risk, it will likely grant no insurance at all. Also, goods
being exported to countries with a high perceived level of political risk will not be
granted credit insurance. The cost of credit insurance can exceed ¥ percent of the
invoiced amount, which varies considerably by the perceived risk of each customer.
The company does not have to absorb this cost; where possible, consider rebilling it to
the customer, who may be willing to pay it in order to obtain a larger line of credit than
would otherwise be the case.

3-6 WHEN SHOULD I REVIEW CUSTOMER CREDIT LEVELS?

 

Conducting a careful review of the credit levels of all customers can require a
massive investment of time by the credit staff. This can include requesting and
reviewing customer financial statements, pulling Dun & Bradstreet credit reports,
visiting customer sites, reviewing payment histories, and having customers revise
existing credit applications. With the burden of processing new credit applications
tacked onto this considerable chore, the typical credit department will be completely
buried in work.

A simple solution is to stratify the customer list by order volume over the past year,
and review the credit of only that 20 percent of the list comprising 80 percent of the
order volume. This approach drastically reduces the amount of credit analysis work
while still ensuring a high level of review on those accounts that could have a serious
bad debt impact on the company.

This approach can be further refined to exclude obviously creditworthy govern-
ment entities, such as the federal government. Conversely, it may be necessary to set
up an additional system for reviewing the credit of customers with smaller order
histories whose orders are increasing in size, even if they fall outside the 20 percent
review threshold. For example, if an existing customer increases its orders from
$1,000 per month to $10,000 per month, this sudden jump may be sufficient cause for
a credit review. However, these cases are exceptions that should not alter the credit
review work load to a noticeable extent.

Another option is to review customer credit levels when a customer issues more
than a single not-sufficient-funds (NSF) check within a predetermined time period.
This option requires the use of NSF tracking by customer. To make this process easier,
consider recording each NSF check returned by the bank in a separate general ledger
account, with each journal entry clearly identifying the customer. One can then
summarize this account to see which customers are repeat offenders.


78 Management Accounting Best Practices

When a customer gets into financial difficulty, a common ploy is to pay the
smallest invoice first, or to ignore the largest invoice in a group of invoices that are all
payable at the same time. By doing so, a company will at least receive something on
the due date, which may keep it from pursuing collection of the unpaid invoices quite
so aggressively as would normally be the case. Skipping payments is a clear sign that a
customer is experiencing cash flow difficulty. As soon as the cash application staff
sees this happening, they should notify the credit manager, who in turn should
schedule the customer for an immediate credit review. This review cannot be delayed,
since the financial condition of some customers may rapidly spiral down into
bankruptcy.

When a customer stops taking cash discounts, it is possible that the customer’s
financial condition has declined to the point where it no longer has the cash to make an
early payment. Thus, this is an excellent early warning of a decline in a customer’s
financial condition. If the cash application staff notices this change, they should notify
the credit manager at once, who can reevaluate the customer’s credit limit.

3-7 HOW CAN | ADJUST THE INVOICE CONTENT AND
LAYOUT TO IMPROVE COLLECTIONS?

 

Most invoices contain nearly all of the information a customer needs to make a
payment, but the layout may be so poor that they must hunt for the information. In
other cases, adding information will reduce payment problems. This section describes
a number of invoice layout changes that can help improve collections.

When a customer receives an invoice and has a question about it, whom does he
call? The invoice usually includes only the company’s mailing address, and may show
only a post office box where the corporate lockbox is located. The solution is to clearly
state contact information on the invoice. This should be delineated by a box and
possibly noted in bold or colored print. If the billing staff is large, it may not be
practical to put a specific contact name on the invoice, but at least list a central contact
phone number. If a company has chosen to assign specific customers to individuals in
the collections department, it may be possible to list the name of the assigned
collections person in the computer file of the customers for whom they are respon-
sible, so the names of assigned people appear on invoices.

Some customers prefer to pay for invoices with a credit card, rather than a check. If
so, they call the general number for the company, ask to be routed to the accounting
department, and leave credit card information with the first “live” person they
contact. This person is frequently not trained in the types of credit card information to
collect (writing down the name on the credit card, card number, expiration date,
billing address, and need for a receipt can be overwhelming for some), so inadequate
information is eventually forwarded to the person trained in processing credit card
payments. This person must call back the customer (who may not have left a return
phone number!) to obtain the required information. A better approach is to list the
credit card contact number on the invoice. A refinement of the concept is to list on the


3-7 How Can | Adjust the Invoice Content? 79

invoice the types of credit cards accepted by the company, which may prevent
customers from making unnecessary calls if they do not have the right types of
cards.

The standard invoice presentation shows the invoice date in one of the upper
corners, and the payment terms (such as ‘“‘Net 30’) somewhere in the header bar, just
above the detailed billing information. For the customer to calculate the proper
payment date, she must locate the invoice date, add to it the payment terms, and enter
this payment date in her computer system. The reality is more complex. The typical
accounting computer system automatically defaults the invoice date to the current
date (invariably later than the invoice date), and adds to it a default payment-terms
date that is stored in the customer file. Thus, there are two ways for a customer to delay
payment: (1) be lazy and accept the current date as the invoice date, and (2) always use
the preset payment terms. The result is chronically late payments. The solution is to
take the payment date calculation chore away from the customer and clearly state the
invoice payment date on the invoice, preferably in bold and located in a box. To make
matters as simple as possible, it may make sense to even eliminate all mention of
payment terms, so the customer does not try to second guess the company on the
proper payment date.

If there is too much clutter on an invoice, customers will have a difficult time
locating key information. For example, some information used by the accounting staff
but not by the customer is included in the header bar, such as the initials of the
customer’s salesperson (usually for commission calculation purposes) and the job
number. At a particularly high level of obscurity, some accounting systems label the
invoice number as something else, such as the ‘“document number.” The end result is
more time spent by the customer wading through an invoice to find the relevant
information, and a greater risk that the wrong or incorrect information will be
transferred from the invoice to the customer’s accounts payable system. The solution
is to strip out unnecessary information or clarify the labeling of needed items. All but
the most primitive accounting computer systems contain report writers that should
allow one to make these changes to the invoice template.

There may be cases where customers demand proof of their receipt of a delivery
from the company before they will pay its invoice. One way to provide this
information is to use either FedEx or United Parcel Service to make deliveries,
since both organizations post receipt signatures on their Web sites. One can then copy
the signature images out of the Web sites and paste them directly into an invoice,
thereby providing proof of receipt to the customer on the invoice. If necessary, the
billing staff can also add the delivery reference number used by either United Parcel
Service or FedEx to the invoice. Either the customer or the company can then go
straight to the Web site of either package delivery company to obtain further evidence
of the time and place of delivery of the package in question. This approach has the
distinct advantage of consolidating both the billing and receiving information for a
delivery on one piece of paper. The downside is that the invoice cannot be issued until
the delivery has been received by the customer, rather than being sent when the
package leaves the company’s premises.

3-8 HOW CAN | ADJUST BILLING DELIVERY
TO IMPROVE COLLECTIONS?

 

An excellent way to increase the speed of invoice delivery, as well as to enhance the
process flow of customer approvals, is to use Adobe’s Acrobat software to create a
perfect electronic copy of an invoice. This copy is then attached to an e-mail and
forwarded straight to a customer’s accounting department where it can be opened,
printed, and paid. Implementing the conversion of invoices into the Acrobat format is
quite simple. First, go to the Adobe Web site (www.adobe.com) to order the Acrobat
software, and purchase a copy for $249. Once installed, go to your accounting software
package and prepare to print an invoice. When the printing screen appears, change the
assigned printer to Adobe PDF, which will appear as one of the available printers. The
software will ask where to store the resulting file and what to name it. After a few
seconds, the conversion of the invoice into a picture-perfect PDF file will be complete.
This is a significant, inexpensive, and operationally elegant way to accelerate cash flow.

There are many situations in which a company knows the exact amount of a customer
billing well before the date on which the invoice is to be sent, such as for a recurring
subscription. In these cases, it makes sense to create the invoice and deliver it to the
customer one or two weeks in advance of the date when it is actually due. By doing so, the
invoice has more time to be routed through the receiving organization, passing through
the mail room, accounting staff, authorized signatory, and back to the accounts payable
staff for payment. This makes it much more likely that the invoice will be paid on time,
which improves cash flow and reduces a company’s investment in accounts receiv-
able. The main difficulty with advance billings is that the date of the invoice should be
shifted forward to the accounting period in which the invoice is supposed to be billed.

When an accounting department issues an invoice containing a large number of
line items, it is more likely that the recipient with have an issue with one or more of the
line items, and will hold payment on the entire invoice while those line items are
resolved. Though this may not be a significant issue when an invoice is relatively small,
it is a large issue indeed when the invoice has a large-dollar total, and holding the entire
invoice will have a serious impact on the amount of accounts receivable outstanding. To
avoid this problem, split apart large invoices into separate ones, with each invoice
containing just one line item. By doing so, it is more likely that some invoices will
be paid at once, while other ones over which there are issues will be delayed. This can
have a significant positive impact on a company’s investment in accounts receivable.
The only complaint arising from this approach is that customers can be buried under
quite a large pile of invoices. This can be ameliorated by clustering all of the invoices in
a single envelope, rather than sending a dozen separately mailed invoices on the same
day. Also, it may be prudent to cluster small-dollar line items on the same invoice, since
this will cut down on the number of invoices issued, while not having a significant
impact on the overall receivable balance if these invoices are put on hold.

Some customers with extremely large payment volumes create payments only on
certain days of the month in order to yield the greatest level of efficiency in processing
what may be thousands of checks. If a company does not send an invoice early enough


3-9 How Do | Accelerate Cash Collections? 81

to be included in the next check processing run, it may have to wait a number of
additional weeks before the next check run occurs, resulting in a late payment. The
solution is to ask customers when they process checks, and make sure that the
company issues invoices well in advance of these dates in order to be paid as early as
possible. If customers are unwilling to divulge this information, it should be possible
to guess at the check printing dates after a few months by tracking the dates when
payments are received.

3-9 HOW DO I ACCELERATE CASH COLLECTIONS?

 

The acceleration of cash movement from the customer to the company is a constant
problem for the accountant. The classic solution is to have them sent to a lockbox, which
is a mailbox maintained by the company’s bank. The bank opens all incoming
envelopes, cashes all checks contained therein, and forwards copies of the checks
to a single individual at the company. The advantage of this approach is that if all
customers are properly notified of the address, all checks will unerringly go to one
location, where they are deposited and then consolidated into a single packet and for-
warded to the cash application person at the company. There are two disadvantages to be
considered. One is the one-day delay in routing checks through a lockbox, which
translates into a one-day delay in applying the cash (though it has already been
deposited by the bank). This problem can be overcome by using lockboxes operated
only by banks that scan the incoming checks and post the images on secure Web sites.
This approach allows the collections staff to access check images immediately after
checks arrive at the lockbox. The other problem is that all customers must be notified of
the change to the lockbox address, which usually requires several follow-up contacts
with a few customers who continue to send their payments to the wrong address.

Lockbox locations will become out of date as customer locations change. For
example, if a company with its accounting headquarters in Kansas City sets up a
lockbox on the west coast to service the bulk of its customers, this does little good
when a geographical expansion to the east coast results in all the east coast checks
being sent to the west coast lockbox, thereby lengthening the mail float before the
company receives its cash. The solution is a periodic review of lockbox locations. A
company can conduct a simple lockbox review by comparing customer locations with
the nearest lockbox locations. However, the periodic change of lockbox locations will
require ongoing contacts with customers to inform them of the address changes,
inevitably resulting in a large number of repeat contacts before all customers are
mailing payments to the new addresses. Given the effort required for this last item, it is
unwise to change lockbox locations more than once a year.

Another way to accelerate cash receipts is to accept credit card payments,
preferably from every major credit card company. By doing so, a company can
frequently persuade the customer to place payment for smaller amounts on either a
corporate or personal credit card, and have the money appear in the corporate bank
account in one or two business days. The maximum amount customers can charge will


82 Management Accounting Best Practices

vary according to internal customer credit card policy, though somewhere in the range
of $1,000 to $2,500 is common. One downside is the credit card servicing fee charged
by the bank, typically resulting in a deduction of 2 to 3 percent. However, consider this
to be the same as offering an early payment discount; it is equivalent to a 2 to 3 percent
discount in exchange for nearly immediate cash.

Another option is to use lockbox truncation. This is the process of converting a
paper check into an electronic deposit. The basic process is to scan a check into a check
reader, which scans the magnetic ink characters on the check into a vendor-supplied
software package. The software sends this information to a third-party ACH processor,
which typically clears payment in one or two days. The system has the additional benefit
of eliminating deposit slips and the per-transaction deposit fees usually charged by
banks. Also, not-sufficient-funds (NSF) fees are lower than if a regular check pay-
ment had been made, while NSFs can be redeposited at once. Another use of lockbox
truncation is to enter into the system check information given to the company over the
phone or fax by a customer. Rather than use the check scanner, one can manually punch
in the information. This approach avoids the age-old check-is-in-the-mail excuse.

3-10 SHOULD | OFFER EARLY PAYMENT DISCOUNTS?

 

Only a company having severe cash flow problems should offer early payment
discounts to its customers. The problem is that the effective interest rate the company
is offering to its customers is extremely high. For example, allowing customers to take
a 2 percent discount if they pay in 10 days, versus the usual 30, means that the
company is offering a 2 percent discount in order to obtain cash 20 days earlier than
normal. The annualized interest rate of 2 percent for 20 days is about 36 percent. All
but the most debt-burdened companies can borrow funds at rates far lower than that!

Furthermore, many customers will not pay within the 10-day discount period, but
will still take the discount. This can lead to a great deal of difficulty in obtaining
payment of the withheld discount. In addition, the collection staff may have difficulty
in applying the cash to open receivables if it is not clear on which invoice a customer is
paying a discounted amount.

3-11 HOW DO | OPTIMIZE CUSTOMER CONTACTS?

 

The prime calling hours for most business customers are in the early to mid-morning
hours, before they have been called away for meetings or other activities. If customers
are concentrated in a single time zone, this can mean that the time period available for
calls is extremely short, and is a particular problem if the collections staff is not prepared
to call customers during that time period. Also, if the customer base spans multiple time
zones, a collections staff based in one time zone may be making calls to customers that
are outside the customers’ prime calling hours, resulting in few completed calls.
Awareness of prime calling hours for individual customers is key. The accountant
should avoid any meetings during prime calling hours, instead focusing on having the


3-12 How Do I Manage Customer Contact Information? 83

collections staff fully prepared to make calls, with all required information close at
hand. In addition, the accountant should require a collections workday that is built
around prime calling hours. For example, if the collections staff is based on the west
coast but most of its customer contacts are on the east coast, its workday should begin
very early in order to make up for the three-hour time difference.

The typical list of overdue invoices is so long that the existing collections staff
cannot possibly contact all customers about all invoices on a sufficiently frequent
basis. This problem results in many invoices not being collected for an inordinately
long time. A good solution is to utilize collections call stratification. The concept
behind this approach is to split up, or stratify, all of the overdue receivables and
concentrate the bulk of the collections staff’s time on the largest invoices. By doing so,
a company can realize improved cash flow by collecting the largest dollar amounts
sooner. The downside of this method is that smaller invoices will receive less attention
and therefore take longer to collect, but this is a reasonable shortcoming if the overall
cash flow from using stratified collections is improved. To implement it, perform a
Pareto analysis of a typical accounts receivable listing and determine the cutoff point
above which 20 percent of all invoices will constitute 80 percent of the total revenue.
For example, a cutoff point of $1,000 means that any invoice of more than $1,000 is in
the group of invoices representing the bulk of a company’s revenue. When it is
necessary to contact customers about collections issues, a much higher number of
customer contacts can be assigned for the invoices over $1,000. For example, a
collections staff can be required to contact customers about all high-dollar invoices
once every three days, whereas low-dollar contacts can be limited to once every two
weeks. By allocating the time of the collections staff in this manner, it is possible to
collect overdue invoices more rapidly.

The typical assignment of overdue customer accounts to the collections staff is quite
basic: Customer names beginning with A through D go to collector Smith, E through H
to collector Jones, and so on. Though this may seem to be a fair and equitable approach
to handing off work, what if the most difficult customers are all lumped into one cluster
of collections assignments? When the distribution of difficult customers does not
match the method of job assignment or (more commonly) the skill level of collectors
does not match the customers to whom they are assigned, a company will find that
its collections are not overly efficient. One solution is to measure the collections staff’s
performance to determine which ones are the top performers, and then assign them the
most difficult customers. By doing so, the company orients its collections resources in
the most targeted manner to achieve the highest possible collections percentage.

3-12 HOW DO | MANAGE CUSTOMER
CONTACT INFORMATION?

 

A poorly organized collections group is one that does not know which customers to
call, what customers said during previous calls, and how frequently contacts should be
made in the future. The result of this level of disorganization is overdue payments


84 Management Accounting Best Practices

being ignored for long periods, other customers being contacted so frequently that
they become annoyed, and continually duplicated efforts. To a large extent, these
problems can be overcome by using a collections call database. The basic concept of a
collections call database is to keep a record of all contacts with the customer, as well as
when to contact the customer next and what other actions to take. The first part of the
database, the key contact list, should contain the following information:

¢ Customer name

¢ Key contact name

¢ Secondary contact name

¢ Internal salesperson’s name with account responsibility
¢ Phone numbers of all contacts

¢ Fax numbers of all contacts

¢ E-mail addresses of all contacts

The contact log comprises the second part of the database and should contain:

¢ Date of contact

¢ Name of person contacted
¢ Topics discussed

¢ Action items

The information noted is easily kept in a notebook if there is a single collections
person, but may require a more complex, centralized database if there are many col-
lections personnel. However, a notebook-based database can be set up in a few hours
with minimal effort, whereas a computerized database, especially one closely linked
to the accounting records for each account receivable, may be a major undertaking.

For those who prefer to install a complete customer contact database on a rapid
time schedule, consider purchasing a software package such as GetPAID, which can
be reviewed at the www.getpaid.com Web site. This product is linked to a company’s
legacy accounting system (specifically, the open accounts receivable and customer
files) by customized interfaces, so there is either a continual or batched flow of
information into it. A key feature it offers is the assignment of each customer to a
specific collections person, so that each person can call up a subset of the overdue
invoices for which he or she is responsible. Within this subset, the software will also
categorize accounts in different sort sequences, such as placing those at the top that
have missed their promised payment dates. Also, the software will present on a single
screen all of the contact information related to each customer, including the promises
made by customers, open issues, and contact information. The system will also allow
the user to enter information for a fax, and then route it directly to the recipient without
requiring the collections person to ever leave his chair. It can also be linked to an auto-
dialer, so the collections staff spends less time attempting to establish connections


3-13 How Do | Involve the Sales Staff in Collections? 85

with overdue customers. To further increase the efficiency of the collections staff, it
will even determine the time zone in which each customer is located, and prioritize the
recommended list of calls, so that only those customers in time zones that are currently
in the midst of standard business hours will be called.

As can be the case in a long marriage, a company’s collections staff and a
customer’s accounts payable department can grow tired of each other, resulting in the
same old collections procedures that the customer gradually begins to ignore. One
solution is to maintain a special database of emergency customer contacts. This list
should never include an accounts payable person, focusing instead on someone a level
or more higher in the customer’s organization. There should be a personal link with
any person on the list, such as a prior meeting with a salesperson or a counterpart
within the company, so the individual will be more likely to assist the collections staff
with an occasional request. Once created, do not use it too much. People outside the
accounts payable area do not enjoy being pestered, and will not appreciate a flood of
requests. Instead, call emergency contacts only when an overdue receivable is a large
one or there is considerable trouble obtaining collection through normal channels.

3-13 HOW DO | INVOLVE THE SALES STAFF
IN COLLECTIONS?

 

The sales staff and credit and collections employees must sometimes wonder if
they work for the same company. The sales staff sees itself as trying to bring in new
orders to bolster company revenues and market share, while the credit and collec-
tions people do not like the burden of having to collect on overdue invoices from
some of the less creditworthy customers brought in by the sales staff. Thus, it is not
uncommon to see a considerable amount of bad feeling between these groups.
Though some tension is always likely to exist between the sales and credit
organizations, one can at least try to make the two groups see each others’ viewpoints
by fostering regular communications, which can take a variety of forms. One is to
have representatives of each department make presentations to or at least attend
the regular meetings of their counterparts. Another option, especially useful for
wide-ranging sales forces, is to include the credit staff in periodic conference calls
with the sales staff. Any of these approaches are especially useful when the company
has a change in credit policy, so the staff will be aware of its impact on them as soon
as possible. Other potential topics of conversation include descriptions of the credit
and collections procedures used, whom to contact within each department about a
variety of issues, and having open discussions about prospective changes within
each department that may impact the other group.

The sales staff tends to focus only on the commission resulting from the sale and not
on the excessive work required by the collections staff to bring in the payment, not to
mention the much higher bad debt allowance needed to offset uncollectible accounts. To
avoid this problem, change the commission system so that salespeople are paid a
commission only on the cash received from customers. This change will instantly turn


86 Management Accounting Best Practices

the entire sales force into a secondary collections agency, since they will be very
interested in bringing in cash on time. They will also be more concerned about the
creditworthiness of their customers, since they will spend less time selling to customers
that have little realistic chance of paying. However, this approach requires salespeople
to wait longer before they are paid a commission, so they are markedly unwilling to
change to this new system. A tougher variation is to not pay commissions at all if
invoices go over 90 days old, on the grounds that the commission system should push
the sales staff to collect as soon as possible. This variation is least effective when
commissions are quite small in comparison to the base pay of the sales staff, and most
effective when commissions make up a large proportion of a salesperson’s pay.

Another possibility is to periodically e-mail the accounts receivable aging report
directly to the sales staff, so they can quickly ascertain the payment status of their
customers. This is easily done in most commercially available accounting software
packages by converting the aging report to Excel, sorting the report by salesperson, and
issuing the file as an e-mail attachment. Since most salespeople have Excel on their
computers, they can easily call up the report, spot impending late payment situations,
and take action before accounts become so old that collection becomes problematic.

A negative way to involve the sales staff in collections is to periodically issue a
report listing bad debts by salesperson. Since many sales should never have been made
except at the insistence of the sales staff, and many collections are never made due to
their nonresponsiveness in assisting in the collections effort, this report serves as a
report card. The bad debt report must be issued with considerable caution, for it shows
only the bad side of a sales staff that may in other respects be highly productive.
Further, considering the potential level of conflict this report can engender, it is best to
present it to the sales manager during a face-to-face meeting, and not to spray it all
over the company with an e-mail distribution.

3-14 HOW DO | HANDLE PAYMENT DEDUCTIONS?

 

An annoying problem with deductions is how they are passed from person to person
within the company without ever reaching resolution. The usual problem is that the
initial reviewer passes it along to the person who initially appears to be most likely to
resolve the problem, and then forgets that the deduction exists, having merely
achieved the short-term goal of removing it from her desk. Then the recipient either
passes the issue along to a third person or requests a response from the customer,
promptly forgetting about the issue. This constant transfer of responsibility inevitably
results in very long deduction resolution periods, annoyed customers, and slow cash
flow. The solution is to centrally manage the deductions resolution process. A single
person should be assigned responsibility for the deductions of a small group of
customers and monitor the status of each open deduction on a daily basis, no matter
which person within the company is currently handling resolution issues. By doing so,
one can apply constant pressure to deduction resolution, thereby shrinking the number
of receivable days outstanding.


3-14 How Do | Handle Payment Deductions? 87

An accountant may inherit a large deductions problem where there are hundreds
of deductions sitting on the accounts receivable aging. The solution is to resolve
deductions for the largest-dollar items first, and then work down through the deduc-
tions list in declining dollar order. This approach is initially designed to take out of the
accounts receivable list the largest deductions; but more importantly, it allows the
collections staff to research the reasons why the largest deductions are occurring, and
to put a stop to them. As the staff gradually fixes these issues and moves down to
small deductions, it can address relatively smaller underlying deduction issues. Thus,
this approach is designed to use deduction dollar volume as the criterion for deter-
mining the relative importance of fixes needed to resolve problems causing deductions.
This approach may have the initial reverse result of actually increasing the number of
unresolved deductions on the books, since the collections staff is now focusing on the
largest and therefore most time-consuming deduction problems. Though a likely
outcome, the underlying problem resolutions implemented by the collections team
should gradually eliminate source problems, which will dry up the flood of incoming
deductions, so the situation will improve a number of months into the future.

As just noted, delving into the reasons why deductions occur is the key to reduc-
ing the overall number of deductions. To attack the core problems causing deduc-
tions, have the collections staff summarize all deductions on a regular basis and
forward this information to management. The management team can then review
the data to see what problems are causing the deductions, and correct them. The
summary report can be sorted a number of ways: by customer, by dollar volume, by
product, by date, and so on. It may be best to issue the report sorted in several for-
mats, since problems hidden within one reporting format are more visible in others.
This approach calls for the use of a central deductions database, which can be as
simple as an electronic spreadsheet for smaller organizations or a database compris-
ing part of a larger enterprise resources planning system, as is used in large companies.

Deductions management works even better when coupled with a deductions
handling procedure. The procedure tends to follow a tiered approach, where very
small deductions are not worth the effort of even a single customer contact, and are
immediately written off. For larger deductions, a company may require immediate
follow-up or only follow-up after the second deduction, or an immediate rebilling—
the choice is up to the individual company. The procedure should include such basic
steps as:

Ensuring that the customer has provided adequate documentation of the problem
Collection of data needed to substantiate or refute the claim

Contacting the customer to obtain missing information

Once collected, reviewing all information to determine a recommended course of
action

Depending on the size of the deduction, obtaining necessary approvals
Contacting the customer with resolution information

7. If approved, entering credit information into the accounting system to clear debit
balances representing valid deductions

The main point is to be consistent. The collections staff must be drilled in the use of
this procedure, so there is absolutely no question about how to handle a deduction.
This will favorably increase departmental efficiency and require less management
time to pass judgment on individual deductions problems.

3-15 HOW DO | COLLECT OVERDUE PAYMENTS?

 

There are a multitude of methods for collecting payments from customers. In this
section, we progress from several milder contact methods into significantly more
aggressive collections techniques.

Most collections departments do not start contacting customers until a number of
days after an invoice due date, either on the assumption that the Postal Service takes a
mighty long time to make deliveries or that a customer’s payment process may be
interfering with timely payment. Whatever the reason, customers with an interest in
delaying payment have an almost guaranteed extra week before a collections person
even begins to think about contacting them. Instead, begin calling immediately after
the invoice due date has passed. If the invoice is due in 30 days, this means contacting
the customer after 31 days. Though some checks will indeed be in the mail at this time,
rendering some calls unnecessary, the vast majority of calls made will be to companies
who have not paid. By taking this approach, the company instills in its customers the
idea that payment terms are to be taken seriously, and the company absolutely expects
payment on the stated date.

The best way to collect small overdue balances is to restrict collections activities to
the use of dunning letters. This is the least expensive way to contact customers, and is
to be preferred over more labor-intensive activities such as direct personal contact or
phone calls. Though only one collections method is advised in this situation, one can
certainly mix up the methods and timing of delivery in order to gain the customer’s
attention. Instead of the traditional mailing, try sending the letter by fax or e-mail, and
distribute it to different people within the customer’s organization in hopes of jarring
loose a response. An easy technological twist to this method is to send the dunning
letters by e-mail. Not only is transmission instantaneous, but recipients also tend to
forward the messages straight to the party who is best able to handle payment. Further,
an e-mail response is likely for a high percentage of these issuances, especially when
dunning messages are custom-written.

A series of dunning letters may not force a delinquent customer into paying for an
overdue invoice. The next step should be to issue an attorney letter. This is a letter
issued on an attorney’s letterhead and supposedly written by the attorney, threatening
legal action if payment is not made. The implication is that the customer is now much
closer to a lawsuit, which sometimes brings about a rapid settlement of the out-
standing balance. Attorney letters are expensive if custom-written by the attorney. To
reduce the cost, write the letter for the attorney and just ask him to print it on his
letterhead. To further reduce costs, state in the letter that all customer responses be
made back to the company, not the attorney. This has the double purpose of


3-15 How Do | Collect Overdue Payments? 89

keeping the attorney from being buried by phone calls and keeping down billed
hours.

Customers do not normally like to pay for an invoice until all disputes related to it
have been resolved, thereby allowing them to pay the full amount, staple the
remittance advice to the complete packet of resolution documentation, and file it
away. This approach is also used by customers not willing to pay at all; they create a
dispute over a small item and refuse payment on the entire invoice, resulting in very
long waits for payment. The solution is to insist on payment of undisputed balances
right away. This is especially appropriate on multiline invoices where only a few items
are being debated. If a customer has a history of withholding payment based on a
disputed item, act quickly and insist on immediate payment of the undisputed balance
until the customer figures out that this ploy will no longer work.

Customers like to promise payment by a certain date, wait for the date to pass, and
then dispute the details of their promise with the collections staff. Even if a collector
has properly documented the last customer contact, the customer can get into the “‘he
said, she said” game and claim that the collector did not write down the details
correctly. Besides being frustrating, this game also delays payment. The best solution
is to write down the promised payment information in a letter or e-mail and send it to
the customer. This confirmation approach ensures that customers see the collector’s
version of the earlier conversation as soon as possible, and have an opportunity to
dispute it at that time. By the time the promised payment date arrives, the customer
should have few excuses left for not paying. If a customer has agreed to a repetitive
series of payments, use this approach to both thank him for the most recent payment
and remind him of the amount and due date of the next payment. Though this may call
for the issuance of quite a few letters, customers will be very aware that the company is
keeping a close eye on the arrival dates of their payments.

There are a few cases where a shipped product is still on hand and untouched by the
customer, making it possible to accept a merchandise return. This possibility exists in
seasonal businesses, where customers may not have been able to sell off all their goods
during the peak season, and now have no way to clear out their inventories. Another
possibility is to review the latest customer financial statements and see if its inventory
turnover is very slow; if so, the customer’s overstocking practices may mean that the
company’s goods are still untouched in the customer’s warehouse. Even if a customer
has used up most of the company’s goods, there may still be a few units on hand that
can be sent back in partial settlement of the outstanding debt.

When a customer does not pay the balance of an overdue invoice, one option is to
shift it over to cash-on-delivery (COD) payment terms. If the customer has no other
source for goods and so must buy from the company, add the entire open balance or a
portion of it to the COD amount, thereby enforcing payment if the customer ever
wants to see any additional goods delivered.

A common approach when no other collections method works is to shift selected
invoices to a collections agency for more aggressive follow-up. In exchange, the
agency requires a percentage of each collected invoice (typically one-third) as pay-
ment for its services. Despite the common perception that collections agencies


90 Management Accounting Best Practices

only go after larger outstanding invoices, a few specialize in the more difficult types of
collections, such as discounts for pricing discrepancies, damaged goods, promotional
allowances, quality problems, quantity-delivered variances, unearned cash discounts,
and the like. Though collections agencies charge high fees for these specialized
services to compensate them for the extra effort required, this may still be better than a
complete write-off of the deductions.

3-16 WHEN SHOULD | TAKE LEGAL ACTION
TO COLLECT FROM A CUSTOMER?

 

Initiating legal action against a customer is an enormously expensive and prolonged
undertaking that is almost never worth the effort. The only party that is assured to
come out ahead on the situation is the lawyer. Even if the court awards a substantial
settlement, the customer may go to great lengths to hide its assets, so the company
never collects a dime. The solution is to always prescreen a customer’s debts prior to
initiating a legal action. This should at least involve purchasing a credit report on the
customer to determine the number of judgments and tax liens already filed against it,
as well as other types of outstanding debt. This type of investigation may very well
reveal that the customer has so many calls upon its assets already that an investment in
legal action is completely uneconomical.

A low-cost legal technique that may rattle an intransigent customer is the threat of
a small claims court filing. Even if the company has no real intent to take an issue to
court, just obtain the complaint documentation from the appropriate court, fill it out,
and send a copy to the customer, with a note attached stating when the cash has to be in
the company’s hands or else the paperwork will be filed with the court. It helps to build
up areference library of small claims court forms, which vary by state (and sometimes
by county), thereby making the filing process faster. Claims of this type are generally
filed in the county where the customer resides, so a great many forms may be required
to cover the locations of the entire customer base.

If the previously noted attempt to obtain payment by sending a small claims
complaint to a customer does not work, the next step is to actually file the complaint
with a small claims court. This is usually in the county where the customer resides, but
can also be where the action over which a complaint is filed took place. In either case,
check with the court to verify the maximum amount of money they will address. If the
amount being claimed is higher, waive the difference in order to fit under the court’s
maximum cap. Also, pull a credit report on the customer to verify its official legal
name and corporate status, so this information can be correctly listed on the complaint
form. Finally, locate a collections attorney located near the small claims court and
request representation at the court for a modest fee and percentage of any proceeds.
These steps are not difficult, and the cost of continuing the process into small claims
court is typically far less than the amount of the debt. Also, since a local attorney
represents the company in court, the collections staff does not waste time traveling to
court. To make the process even more efficient, create a procedure for this process and


3-16 When Should | Take Legal Action to Collect from a Customer? 91

maintain a list of local attorneys to contact for representation in court. With these steps
in place, collecting through small claims court becomes a mechanical and efficient
process.

Even if a court issues a judgment against a customer and in favor of the com-
pany, the customer may illegally attempt to dispose of corporate assets, so there is
nothing left for the company to attach. Thus, after all the time and expense of court
proceedings, a company still receives nothing for its efforts. Consider having the
court issue a restraining notice to the customer. This is a document stating that
the customer cannot dispose of any assets. It is especially effective when used to
freeze the customer’s bank account, since the receiving bank will block all account
access at once. This approach is useful only after a legal judgment has been
obtained, so a customer will have already had plenty of time (possibly years) to
fraudulently dispose of assets.

Though the average lawyer can be counted on to have training and expertise in the
general conduct of a lawsuit, this does not mean that she has any idea of how to collect
the money judgment in the event of a successful lawsuit. Collection requires tracking
down the location of assets (possibly through a court-ordered interrogatory), filing
the correct paperwork to attach them, and assisting in asset liquidation. Few lawyers
have taken the time to acquire this level of expertise. Clearly, finding a lawyer with
money judgment collection expertise is of paramount importance if a company
regularly finds itself with money judgments but no way to collect. Though one can find
the right lawyer through references from other attorneys or collections agencies, this
can involve a long process of trying out a succession of lawyers until a productive one
is found.

Control System Decisions

The proper use of controls has become an increasingly important part of the
accountant’s role, given the highly publicized abuse of company assets that
have been reported in the press in recent years. The accountant needs to be con-
cerned with control usage in many processes throughout the company, includ-
ing order entry, purchasing, payables, inventory management, billings, cash
receipts, and payroll. In all of these areas, the potential exists for significant asset
losses.

This chapter provides detailed answers to questions about which controls to install
over each of these areas, and more. The following table itemizes the section number in
which the answers to each question can be found:

4-1 WHY DO I NEED CONTROLS?

 

Any company operates under a complex set of policies and procedures that in total
comprise a set of processes that ultimately generate revenues and profits. These
processes are subject to breakdown at a variety of failure points, either inadvertently
or intentionally, through fraud. We install controls to identify or forestall process
failures.

A control can itself break down through inattention, lack of formal training
or procedures, or intentionally, through fraud. To mitigate these issues, some
processes involving especially high levels of asset loss are more likely to require
two controls to attain a single control objective, thereby reducing the risk that
the control objective will not be attained. However, double controls are not

92


4-2 How Do | Control Order Entry? 93

recommended in most situations, especially if the controls are not automated,
since they can increase the cost and duration of the processes they are designed to
safeguard.

All areas of a company contain some control weaknesses, while some harbor key
risk areas, especially the diversion of company assets or misrepresentation of
financial results. Of primary concern are those areas where these two issues
coincide. A major risk area is revenue recognition, for there are a variety of
ways to manipulate it to improperly accelerate revenues, thereby reporting exces-
sively profitable financial results. Other areas of significant risk are the capitaliza-
tion of assets and the valuation of such reserves as bad debts, warranty claims, or
product returns. Several other high-risk areas are also unrelated to basic process
flows: the valuation of acquired assets, related-party transactions, contingent
liabilities, and special-purpose entities. Thus, even with in-depth and comprehen-
sive controls over such key processes as purchasing, billings, and cash receipts,
there are still significant areas lying outside the traditional control systems that can
be easily circumvented.

4-2 HOW DO I CONTROL ORDER ENTRY?

 

Order entry is the initial point at which a customer order enters a company. It is not
only the creation of a sales order for distribution throughout the company, but also a
number of additional steps: verifying the existence of the customer, ensuring that
there is sufficient inventory on-hand to fill the order, and verifying pricing and related
order terms.

One significant control for order entry is verifying that the person placing
the order is an approved buyer. This control is not frequently used for small
orders, since the chances of a control problem are relatively slight in most cases.
However, it may be useful when the size of the order being placed is extremely
large.

Also, review the on-hand status of any inventory being ordered, in case the
company would otherwise be committing to an order it cannot ship. If the order entry
computer system is linked to the current inventory balance, then the system should
warn the order entry staff if there is not a sufficient quantity in stock to fulfill an order,
and will predict the standard lead time required to obtain additional inventory. A more
advanced level of automation results in the computer system presenting the order
entry staff with similar products that are currently in stock, which the staff can present
to customers as alternative purchases.

One of the best control improvements that a computer system brings to the
order entry process is the ability to automatically set up product prices based on
the standard corporate price book. If the information in the price book varies from
the price listed on the purchase order, then the order entry staff must either obtain
a supervisory override to use the alternative price, or discuss the situation with the
customer.


94 Management Accounting Best Practices

Ifthe order entry staff still fills out a sales order based on the customer order, rather
than entering this information into the computer for automatic distribution throughout
the company, then an additional control is to compare the information on the sales
order and originating customer purchase order, to ensure that the order information
was transcribed correctly.

Finally, when products are returned by customers, it is possible that an error in the
order entry or shipment processes caused the return. To investigate this potential
problem, compare the return documents with the customer purchase order and sales
order.

4-3 HOW DO I CONTROL CREDIT MANAGEMENT?

 

The credit management function involves an examination of the finances of custo-
mers, to ensure that they are financially capable of paying for any orders that the
company ships to them. There is a considerable risk that orders may be shipped in
circumvention of the credit management process, so the controls noted below should
be considered essential.

A mandatory control is to require that all sales orders be sent to the credit
department for approval before any shipment is made. It is customary to bypass the
credit approval process for small orders, repair and maintenance orders, and when
customers have established credit lines with the company.

If the order entry system has a workflow management capability, then any orders
entered by the order entry staff will be routed to the credit department as soon as the
orders are entered. This control not only speeds up the credit review process, but also
ensures that every order entered will be routed to the credit department. This control is
typically modified, so that orders falling below a minimum threshold are automa-
tically approved.

It is possible for sales orders to be fraudulently routed around the credit depart-
ment, so create an approval stamp to be used on each sales order. This approval stamp
should include space for the signature of the credit manager, and for the date when the
approval was granted. The shipping manager should not ship from any sales order that
does not contain this signed approval stamp. Also, the credit approval stamp should be
locked up when not in use.

If an enterprisewide computer system is in use, then the credit department
can issue an online approval of a customer order, which the computer system
then routes to the shipping department for fulfillment. The beauty of this con-
trol is that the shipping staff never sees the customer order until it has been
approved, so there is minimal risk of an unapproved order inadvertently being
shipped.

A serious control problem arises when there is no formal definition of how to
calculate a credit limit. This results in widely varying credit levels being granted. To
resolve this problem, create and consistently apply a standardized credit policy to all
customers.


4-4 How Do | Control Purchasing? 95

Finally, the financial condition of customers will inevitably change over time,
thereby rendering the original credit review obsolete. A useful control is to build
several flags into the computer system that highlight those customers whose order-
ing or payment habits indicate a change in their financial condition. These flags
should trigger a credit review. Examples of possible flags are customer checks being
returned due to insufficient funds in their bank accounts, recurring evidence of
payments being skipped, and early payment discounts no longer being taken. In
addition, a regularly scheduled credit review of the largest customers may spot
incipient credit problems.

4-4 HOW DO I CONTROL PURCHASING?

 

The purchasing process can result in considerable losses if a few key controls are not
implemented. These losses can be considerable, since the bulk of all corporate
expenditures flow through the purchasing department. Further, if a company uses
automated check signing, rather than a review by a manager before any checks are
manually signed, then the purchasing process is the only point at which improper
payments can be spotted.

The first necessary control is a policy that a purchase order must be issued for every
purchase made by the company. This means that the purchasing staff must also
forward a copy of each purchase order to the receiving dock, where it is used to verify
the purchasing authorization for each item received.

As a continuation of the last control, the receiving staff must reject any
incoming deliveries for which there is no authorizing purchase order. This control
can be quite time-consuming for the receiving department, which must research
purchase order information for every delivery. To ease their workload, suppliers
should be asked to prominently tag their deliveries with the authorizing purchase
order number.

Also, if the purchasing department uses paper-based purchase orders, then it must
restrict access to the purchase orders by locking them in a storage cabinet when not in
use. Otherwise, blank forms could be used by unauthorized parties to order goods. In
addition, the purchasing manager can more easily determine if blank forms have been
removed by prenumbering all purchase orders, keeping track of the numbers used, and
investigating any missing numbers.

If the purchasing department creates all of its purchase orders through a
computer database, then it must restrict access to that database to guard against
the unauthorized creation of purchase orders. Typical controls include pass-
word protection, regular password changes, access being limited to a small
number of purchasing staff, and a human resources check-off list for departing
employees that calls for the immediate cancellation of their database access
privileges.

Finally, a detective control is to compare payments with authorizing purchase
orders, in order to spot payments made without a supporting purchase order. This


96 Management Accounting Best Practices

constitutes evidence of a breach of the corporate policy to require a purchase order for
all expenditures.

4-5 HOW DO I CONTROL PROCUREMENT CARDS?

 

Procurement cards are essentially credit cards that are used by designated employees
to purchase small-dollar items without any prior authorization. Their use greatly
reduces the labor of the purchasing department, which can instead focus its purchas-
ing efforts on large-dollar items. However, because the use of procurement cards falls
completely outside the normal set of controls used for the procurement cycle, an
entirely different set of controls are needed.

The first key control for procurement cards is for users to enter their receipt
information into a procurement card transaction log. When employees use pro-
curement cards, there is a danger that they will purchase a multitude of items, and
not remember all of them when it comes time to approve the monthly purchases
statement. By maintaining a log of purchases, the card user can tell which statement
line items should be rejected. A sample transaction log is shown in Exhibit 4.1.

Another key control is to reconcile the transaction log with the monthly card
statement. Each card holder must review his or her monthly purchases, as itemized
by the card issuer on the monthly card statement. A sample of the statement of
account used for this reconciliation is shown in Exhibit 4.2, where it is assumed
that the company obtains an electronic feed of all procurement card transactions
from the card provider, and dumps this information into individualized reports
for each card user. This approach provides each user with a convenient checklist
of reconciliation activities within the statement of account, but the same result can
be obtained by stapling a reconciliation activity checklist to a copy of the bank
statement.

Each card user must also fill out a missing receipt form. This form itemizes
each line item on the statement of account for which there is no receipt. The
department manager must review and approve this document, thereby ensuring
that all purchases made are appropriate. A sample missing receipt form is shown in
Exhibit 4.3.

In addition, there must be an organized mechanism for card holders to reject
line items on the statement of account. A good approach is to use a procurement

4-6 HOW DO I CONTROL PAYABLES?

 

The accounts payable process is among the most complex and difficult to control of
all company processes, because it is the recipient of a blizzard of paperwork
from all over the company—supplier invoices, receiving documents, purchase orders,
and expense reports. The key to controlling payables is to install iron-clad controls
in just a few control points, where incoming information can be properly sorted,
identified, and scheduled for payment.

The first control is locating authorization of payment for every supplier invoice.
The complex variation on this control is the three-way match, whereby the supplier
invoice is matched against both the authorizing purchase order and receiving
documentation. This is a tedious, error-prone, and inefficient control, and so should
be used only for the most expensive purchases.

Also, if supplier invoices are being stored in an accounting database, have the
software automatically conduct a duplicate invoice number review. This results in the
automatic rejection of duplicate invoices.

Having multiple supplier records for the same supplier presents a problem when
attempting to locate duplicate supplier invoices, since the same invoice may have been
charged multiple times to different supplier records. One of the best ways to address
this problem is to adopt a standard naming convention for all new supplier names, so
that it will be readily apparent if a supplier name already exists. For example, the file
name might be the first seven letters of the supplier name, followed by a sequential
number. Under this sample convention, the file name for Smith Brothers would be
recorded as SMITHBROO1.

A lesser control is that payments may be made to suppliers too early or too late,
either depriving the company of interest income (in the first place) or causing it to incur
supplier ill-will or late charges (in the latter case). If the payables system is paper-
based, the proper control for this is to store payables by their due dates, and then pay
based on this filing system. If the system is computer-based, the best control is to not
only set up payment terms in the vendor master file, but also to periodically compare
supplier invoices against this file, to see whether any payment terms have changed.

An employee with access to the vendor master file could alter a supplier’s remit-to
address, process checks having a revised address that routes the checks to the
employee, and then alter the vendor master record again, back to the supplier’s
remit-to address. If this person can also intercept the cashed check copy when it is
returned by the bank, there is essentially no way to detect this type of fraud. The
solution is to run a report listing all changes to the vendor master record, which
includes the name of the person making changes.

The payment part of the payables process calls for several additional controls.
First, always keep unused check stock in a locked storage cabinet. In addition, the


4-7 How Do | Control Inventory? 101

range of check numbers used should be stored in a separate location, and cross-
checked against the check numbers on the stored checks, to verify that no checks have
been removed from the locked location. Also, the check signer must compare the
backup information attached to each check against the check itself, verifying the
payee name, amount to be paid, and the due date. This review is intended to spot
unauthorized purchases, payments to the wrong parties, or payments being made
either too early or too late. This is a major control point for companies not using
purchase orders, since the check signer represents the only supervisory-level review
of purchases.

In addition, if there are many check signers, it is possible that unsigned checks will
be routed to the person least likely to conduct a thorough review of the accompanying
voucher package, thereby rendering this control point invalid. Consequently, it is best
to have only two check signers: one designated as the primary signer to whom all
checks are routed, and a backup who is used only when the primary check signer is not
available for a lengthy period of time.

Finally, always perforate the voucher package with the word ‘‘Paid,” or some other
word that clearly indicates the status of the voucher package. Otherwise, the voucher
package could be reused as the basis for an additional payment.

4-7 HOW DO I CONTROL INVENTORY?

 

A company’s investment in inventory may be considerable, so maintaining proper
controls over both the quantity and the valuations assigned to it may be paramount.
Controls in this area cover both the storage of inventory and its movement within the
company’s premises.

Inventory is nearly impossible to store if employees are allowed into the storage
area, since they may move it within the warehouse or remove it entirely. Accordingly,
a necessary control is to fence in the storage area, and allow only authorized
warehouse staff into the storage area. Also, all storage locations within the warehouse
must be tagged in an orderly and logical manner, so that inventory can be more easily
located by its storage identification numbers.

Additionally, qualified employees who are highly knowledgeable in inventory
identification should label each inventory item with the correct part number and unit
of measure, so that inventory is not lost through misidentification.

Furthermore, all received inventory should be put away at once and its identification
and storage information entered into an inventory database immediately. Otherwise,
there will be no record of received inventory, so it can be neither used nor counted.

Another control that may be of considerable use to companies handling customer
inventory is to physically segregate such inventory, so that it is not commingled with
company-owned inventory. Commingled assets will likely result in an incorrect
overstatement of on-hand inventory.

When inventory is moved from the warehouse to the production or shipping areas,
there is a chance that the picking information will be inaccurate, especially if it has


102 Management Accounting Best Practices

been copied from a source document. To avoid the possibility of transcription errors,
always use a copy of the source document, such as the sales order or the customer’s
original purchase order, to ensure that the correct items are picked. Also, always
record inventory movements on move tickets that can then be used to enter the
changes into the inventory database (or better yet, scan the information on-site with a
bar-code scanner). Otherwise, the warehouse staff will quickly lose track of its move
transactions, resulting in the complete corruption of the inventory database. These
move tickets should also be prenumbered, so that all missing move tickets can be
periodically investigated.

Inventory valuation will be more accurate if it is supported by several controls.
First, if the company’s computer system has a bill of materials, periodically review the
file change log to determine what changes have been made, and by whom. This log
contains evidence of alterations that could significantly change the inventory valuation.
Another way to achieve the same result is to compare the unextended product cost
on a per-unit basis with the same cost in previous periods, to spot any changes. The
inventory valuation may also be affected by journal entries made to the inventory or
cost-of-goods-sold account. Accordingly, part of the standard month-end closing
procedure should include the investigation of all journal entries made to these accounts.

Inventory valuation may also be affected by the application of the lower-of-cost-
or-market (LCM) rule, whereby inventory can be valued no higher than its market
price as of the measurement date. To ensure that the company is not surprised by such
changes, always schedule an LCM review as part of the closing process.

Another issue impacting inventory valuation is obsolete inventory, which
must be written off once it has been identified. One control used to mitigate this
expense is a policy requiring that impacted inventory be used up before an
engineering change order that affects them is implemented. Also, items identified
as obsolete should be segregated in a central area, where they can be more easily
dispositioned.

Finally, the inventory valuation will be greatly assisted by the implementation of a
cycle counting system, which is arguably the best inventory control of all. Under cycle
counting, a small percentage of the inventory is counted by experienced warehouse
personnel every day, with all variances being thoroughly investigated and resolved.
The problem-resolution phase of cycle counting will likely locate a number of
process-related problems that, if corrected, will lead to a much more accurate
database and inventory valuation.

4-8 HOW DO I CONTROL BILLINGS?

 

The act of creating and delivering an invoice is central to a company’s ability to collect
cash from its customers, so several key controls are required to ensure that this process
proceeds smoothly.

The first and most important control is to compare the shipping log to the invoice
register to ensure that all shipments have been billed. If a company is in the service


4-9 How Do | Control Cash Receipts? 103

industry, then a similar comparison would be between the log of billed hours and the
invoice register. The intent is to ensure that all products or services provided to
customers are properly billed.

A form of control is to modify the physical layout of the invoice in order to make it
as simple as possible for the recipient to understand and process for payment. This
should include the clear presentation of the amount due, invoice number, and due date.
Of equal importance, all information not relevant to the customer (such as the name of
the salesperson, the job number, and the document number) should be removed from
the invoice. Also, if there are continuing problems with the accuracy of issued
invoices, then a good control is to include an accounting manager’s phone number on
the standard invoice form, and encourage customers to call if they have problems. Do
not have customers call the person who created the invoice, since this person would be
more likely to ignore or cover up the complaint.

Some invoices are so complex, involving the entry of purchase order numbers,
many line items, price discounts and other credits, that it is difficult to create an error-
free invoice. If so, customers reject the invoices, thereby delaying the payment process.
To correct this problem, assign a second person to be the invoice proofreader. This
person has not created the invoice, and so has an independent view of the situation and
can provide a more objective view of invoice accuracy. However, due to the delay
caused by proofreading, it may be unnecessary for small-dollar or simplified invoices.

Finally, the billing and collection functions should always be segregated. By
doing so, it becomes much more difficult for a collections person to fraudulently
access incoming customer payments and alter invoices and credit memos to hide the
missing funds.

4-9 HOW DO I CONTROL CASH RECEIPTS?

 

Cash has historically been the most obvious asset to steal from a company. Accord-
ingly, the handling of checks and cash has been burdened with the largest number of
controls of all processes, even though the total amount of cash on hand at any time is
usually much less than for other types of company assets. Accordingly, use only the
minimum number of controls noted in this section to ensure a reasonable level of
control over cash receipts; any additional controls will only increase the workload on
an already inefficient process.

The best control over cash receipts is to not receive the cash at all—have customers
send it to a lockbox instead. This approach eliminates many controls, since the cash is
immediately deposited by the receiving bank. The next best control is to have the
mailroom staff immediately reroute all incoming payments to the lockbox, thereby
also avoiding the same controls.

If cash or checks must be received in-house, then the first control is to have
the mailroom staff prepare a check prelist, which itemizes the amounts of all checks
and cash received. Preferably, two people in the mailroom should open the mail
together, to ensure that no cash is stolen at this point. This list can then be compared


104 Management Accounting Best Practices

with the results of downstream processing operations to see if any payment informa-
tion was subsequently modified. The mailroom staff also endorses all checks ‘‘for
deposit only” and clearly specifies the account number into which they should be
deposited, so that they cannot be cashed into some other account.

The cashier then enters the receipts into the cash receipts journal, prepares a daily
bank deposit slip, and sends the checks and cash to the bank. A different person should
then compare the check prelist against the deposit slip (even better, use the validated
deposit slip that is returned by the bank) and cash receipts journal to see if the numbers
match. Finally, another clerk should reconcile the month-end bank statement to
the general ledger, to ensure that the company’s cash receipt records match those of
the bank.

If a company is primarily handling cash, rather than checks, then the control
situation is somewhat different. When receiving cash from a customer, always give
that person a receipt and retain a copy; this gives the customer a chance to spot an error
on the receipt. Also, a different clerk from the one who initially entered the cash
receipts should reconcile the on-hand cash to the receipt copies. Then, the cash should
be transported to the bank in a locked container. Finally, the bank’s deposit receipt
should be reconciled to the company’s receipt records.

A few additional cash-handling controls can enhance the cash control en-
vironment. First, give only one person access to a cash register during a work
shift. This makes it easier to assign responsibility for any inaccuracies in the recording
of cash receipts. A more obtrusive control is video surveillance of the cash registers.

Second, require supervisory approval of cash refunds. This is because an
employee can steal cash by taking money from the cash register and recording a
refund on the cash register tape. By requiring a supervisory password or key entry for
every refund issued, the cash register operator has no opportunity to steal cash by this
method.

The use of petty cash is not recommended, since it is too easy for anyone to
pilfer the petty cash box, or to steal the entire box. Thus, the best control over petty
cash is to eliminate it entirely. If this cannot be achieved, then always require a valid
receipt as proof of expenditure whenever issuing petty cash, and also require a
receipt signature on all payments. The signature requirement is especially impor-
tant, since otherwise the petty cash custodian could manufacture receipts and
directly pocket funds from the petty cash box. In addition, conduct unannounced
audits of petty cash, looking for incomplete or suspicious receipts, missing receipt
vouchers, or missing cash. Finally, install a petty cash contact alarm that will be
triggered if the petty cash box is removed.

4-10 HOW DO | CONTROL PAYROLL?

 

In many companies, payroll comprises the largest expense, especially in the service
industry. Accordingly, payroll controls must be especially stringent in order to avoid
excessive expenditures.


4-10 How Do | Control Payroll? 105

An essential control is to verify that all timecards have been received, because it is
entirely possible for an employee’s timesheet to disappear during the accumulation of
timesheet data, or to never be submitted. In either case, once payday comes and there
is no check, impacted employees will want an immediate payment, which represents
not only additional work for the payroll staff, but a sudden and unexpected additional
cash outflow.

Supervisors should also review the time submitted by employees, and speci-
fically approve all overtime hours worked. This is needed, because employees
may pad their timesheets with extra hours, hoping to be paid for these amounts.
Alternatively, they may have fellow employees clock them in and out on days when
they are not working. Despite this control, such actions can be difficult to spot,
especially when there are many employees for a supervisor to track, or if employees
work in outlying locations.

Avery important control is to obtain written approval of all pay rate changes, since
these changes can cumulatively result in extremely large increases in expenditures.
This approval should be from a person knowledgeable in the proposed rate of change
in pay, and of what pay rate has been budgeted. It is also useful to have someone
besides the payroll clerk compare the payroll register to the authorizing pay docu-
ments, to ensure that the correct pay rates are being used.

If the company uses an employee self-service portal, it is possible that
employees will make erroneous changes to their employee records. To spot
these problems, have the payroll system automatically send a confirming e-mail
message detailing the change. This gives employees the opportunity to spot
errors in their entries, while also notifying them if someone else has gained
access to the payroll system using their access codes and has altered their pay-
roll information.

When calculated manually, payroll is the single most error-prone function in the
accounting area. To reduce the number of errors, have someone other than the payroll
clerk review the wage and tax calculations for errors. This does not have to be a
detailed duplication of all calculations made; a simple scan for reasonableness is
likely to spot obvious errors.

The person who physically hands out paychecks to employees is sometimes
called the paymaster. This person does not prepare the paychecks or sign them, and
his sole responsibility in the payroll area is to hand out paychecks. If an employee is
not available to accept a paycheck, then the paymaster retains that person’s check in
a secure location until the employee is personally available to receive it. This
approach avoids the risk of giving the paycheck to a friend of the employee who
might cash it, and also keeps the payroll staff from preparing a check and cashing it
themselves.

It is quite useful to periodically give supervisors a list of paychecks issued to
everyone in their departments, because they may be able to spot payments being made
to employees who are no longer working there. This is a particular problem in larger
companies, where any delay in processing termination paperwork can result in
continuing payments to ex-employees. It is also a good control over any payroll


106 Management Accounting Best Practices

clerk who may be trying to defraud the company by delaying termination paperwork
and then pocketing the paychecks produced in the interim.

When the bank sends back copies of cashed checks as part of its monthly bank
statement, consider reviewing the checks for double endorsements. If a payroll
clerk has continued to issue checks to a terminated employee and is pocketing the
check, then the cashed check should contain a forged signature for the departed
employee, as well as a second signature for the account name into which the check
is deposited.

4-11 HOW DO | CONTROL FIXED ASSETS?

 

Fixed assets can involve very large sums of cash, so controls are needed over their
initial acquisition, as well as their subsequent tracking and ultimate disposition.

The first control over fixed asset acquisitions is to obtain funding approval through
the annual budgeting process. This is an intensive review of overall company
operations, as well as of how capital expenditures will be integrated into the
company’s strategic direction. Expenditure requests included in the approved budget
should still be subjected to some additional approval at the point of actual expenditure,
to ensure that they are still needed. However, expenditure requests not included in the
approved budget should be subjected to a considerably higher level of analysis and
approval, to ensure that there is a justifiable need for them.

Given the significant amount of funds usually needed to acquire a fixed asset,
always require and review a completed capital investment approval form before
issuing a purchase order. An example is shown in Exhibit 4.5. Depending on the size
of the acquisition, a number of approval signatures may be required, extending up to
the company president or even the chairperson of the board of directors.

A good detective control to ensure that all acquisitions have been properly
authorized is to periodically reconcile all fixed asset additions to the file of approved
capital expenditure authorizations. Any acquisitions for which there is no authoriza-
tion paperwork are then flagged for additional review, typically including reporting of
the control breach to management.

Compare fixed asset serial numbers with the existing serial number database.
There is a possibility that employees are acquiring assets, selling them to the
company, then stealing the assets and selling them to the company again. To spot
this behavior, always enter the serial number of each acquired asset in the fixed asset
master file, and then run a report comparing serial numbers for all assets to see if there
are duplicate serial numbers on record.

There are a number of downstream errors that can arise when fixed asset
information is incorrectly entered in the fixed asset master file. For example, an
incorrect asset description can result in an incorrect asset classification, which in turn
may result in an incorrect depreciation calculation. Similarly, an incorrect asset
location code can result in the subsequent inability to locate the physical asset, which
in turn may result in an improper asset disposal transaction. Further, an incorrect

acquisition price may result in an incorrect depreciation calculation. To mitigate the
risk of all these errors, have a second person review all new entries to the fixed asset
master file for accuracy.

If a company acquires assets that are not easily differentiated, then it is useful to
affix an identification plate to each one to assist in later audits. The identification plate


4-11 How Do | Control Fixed Assets? 109

can be a metal tag if durability is an issue, or can be a laminated bar-code tag for easy
scanning, or even a radio frequency identification tag. The person responsible for
tagging should record the tag number and asset location in the fixed asset master
file.

There is a significant risk that assets will not be carefully tracked through the
company once they are acquired. To avoid this, formally assign responsibility for each
asset to the department manager whose staff uses the asset, and send all managers a
quarterly notification of what assets are under their control. Even better, persuade the
human resources manager to include “asset control” as a line item in the formal
performance review for all managers.

Fixed assets decline in value over time, so it is essential to conduct a regular review
to determine whether any assets should be disposed of before they lose their resale
value. This review should be conducted at least annually, and should include
representatives from the accounting, purchasing, and user departments. An alternative
approach is to create capacity utilization metrics (which are most easily obtained for
production equipment), and report on utilization levels as part of the standard monthly
management reporting package; this tends to result in more immediate decisions to
eliminate unused equipment.

There is a risk that employees could sell off assets at below-market rates or
disposition assets for which an alternative in-house use had been planned. Also, if
assets are informally disposed of, the accounting staff will probably not be notified,
and so will continue to depreciate an asset no longer owned by the company, rather
than writing it off. To avoid these problems, require the completion of a signed capital
asset disposition form such as the one shown in Exhibit 4.6.

If the company owns fixed assets that can be easily moved and have a significant
resale value, then there is a risk that they will be stolen. If so, consider restricting
access to the building during non-work hours, and hire a security staff to patrol the
perimeter or at least the exits. An alternative is to affix a radio frequency identification
(RFID) tag to each asset, and then install a transceiver near every building exit that will
trigger an alarm if the RFID tag passes by the transceiver.

Financial Analysis Decisions

The accountant is constantly asked to conduct a variety of financial analyses
regarding key management decisions. These analyses usually require a knowl-
edge of analysis techniques well beyond the typical transaction processing and
accounting presentation skills learned in college. Instead, the accountant must
understand breakeven analysis, product mix analysis, how to create a what-if
analysis with an electronic spreadsheet, how to create a cost variance table, how to
allocate funds, and how throughput analysis can assist with a number of major
decisions.

This chapter provides answers to all of these issues and more. The following table
itemizes the section number in which the answers to each question can be found:

5-1 HOW DO I CALCULATE THE BREAKEVEN POINT?

 

Breakeven analysis is the revenue level at which a company earns exactly no profit. It
is also known as the cost-volume-profit relationship. To determine a breakeven point,
add up all the fixed costs for the company or product being analyzed, and divide it by
the associated gross margin percentage. This results in the sales level at which a
company will neither lose nor make money—its breakeven point. The formula is
shown in Exhibit 5.1.

110


5-1 How Do | Calculate the Breakeven Point? 111

 

Exhibit 5.1. The Breakeven Formula

 

 

 

Total fixed costs /Gross margin percentage = Breakeven sales level

 

For those who prefer a graphical layout to a mathematical formula, a breakeven
chart can be quite informative. In the sample chart shown in Exhibit 5.2, we show a
horizontal line across the chart that represents the fixed costs that must be covered by
gross margins, irrespective of the sales level. The fixed cost level will fluctuate over
time and in conjunction with extreme changes in sales volume, as noted in the next
section, but we will assume no changes for the purposes of this simplified analysis.
Also, there is an upward-sloping line that begins at the left end of the fixed cost line
and extends to the right across the chart. This is the percentage of variable costs, such
as direct labor and materials that are needed to create the product. The last major
component of the breakeven chart is the sales line, which is based in the lower-left
corner of the chart and extends to the upper-right corner. The amount of the sales
volume in dollars is noted on the vertical axis, while the amount of production
capacity used to create the sales volume is noted across the horizontal axis. Finally,

there is a line that extends from the marked breakeven point to the right and that is
always between the sales line and the variable cost line. This represents income tax
costs. These are the main components of the breakeven chart.

It is also useful to look between the lines on the graph and understand what the
volumes represent. For example, as noted in Exhibit 5.2, the area beneath the fixed
costs line is the total fixed cost to be covered by product margins. The area between
the fixed cost line and the variable cost line is the total variable cost at different
volume levels. The area beneath the income line and above the variable cost line is
the income tax expense at various sales levels. Finally, the area beneath the revenue
line and above the income tax line is the amount of net profit to be expected at various
sales levels.

5-2 WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF FIXED COSTS ON
THE BREAKEVEN POINT?

 

A common alteration in fixed costs is when additional personnel or equipment are
needed in order to support an increased level of sales activity. As noted in the

Exhibit 5.3. Breakeven Chart Including Impact of Step Costing


5-3 Whatis the Impact of Variable Cost Changes on the Breakeven Point? 113

breakeven chart in Exhibit 5.3, the fixed cost will step up to a higher level (an
occurrence known as step costing) when a certain capacity level is reached. An
example of this situation is when a company has maximized the use of a single
shift, and must add supervision and other overhead costs such as electricity and
natural gas expenses in order to run an additional shift. Another example is when
a new facility must be brought on line or an additional machine acquired.
Whenever this happens, management must take a close look at the amount of
fixed costs that will be incurred, because the net profit level may be less after the
fixed costs are added, despite the extra sales volume. In Exhibit 5.3, the maximum
amount of profit that a company can attain is at the sales level just prior to
incurring extra fixed costs, because the increase in fixed costs is so high. Though
step costing does not always involve such a large increase in costs as noted in
Exhibit 5.3, this is certainly a major point to be aware of when increasing capacity
to take on additional sales volume. In short, more sales do not necessarily lead to
more profits.

5-3 WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF VARIABLE COST
CHANGES ON THE BREAKEVEN POINT?

 

Though one would think that the variable cost is a simple percentage that is
composed of labor and material costs, and which never varies, this is not the
case. This percentage can vary considerably, and frequently drops as the sales
volume increases. The reason for the change is that the purchasing depart-
ment can cut better deals with suppliers when it orders in larger volumes. In
addition, full truckload or railcar deliveries result in lower freight expenses
than would be the case if only small quantities were purchased. The result is
shown in Exhibit 5.4, where the variable cost percentage is at its highest when
sales volume is at its lowest, and gradually decreases in concert with an increase
in volume.

Because material and freight costs tend to drop as volume increases, it is
apparent that profits will increase at an increasing rate as sales volume goes up,
though there may be step costing problems at higher capacity levels, as is the case
in Exhibit 5.4.

Another point is that the percentage of variable costs will not decline at a steady
rate. Instead, and as noted in Exhibit 5.4, there will be specific volume levels at which
costs will drop. This is because the purchasing staff can negotiate price reductions
only at specific volume points. Once such a price reduction has been achieved, there
will not be another opportunity to reduce prices further until a separate and distinct
volume level is reached once again. In short, suppliers do not charge lower prices just
because a customer’s sales volume goes up incrementally by one unit—they only
reduce prices when there are increases in the volume of purchases of thousands of
units.

Exhibit 5.4 Breakeven Chart Including Impact of Volume Purchases

5-4 HOW DO PRICING CHANGES ALTER
THE BREAKEVEN POINT?

 

Acommon problem impacting the volume line in the breakeven calculation is that unit
prices do not remain the same when volume increases. Instead, a company finds that it
can charge a high price early on, when the product is new and competes with few other
products in a small niche market. Later, when management decides to go after larger
unit volume, unit prices drop in order to secure sales to a larger array of customers, or
to resellers who have a choice of competing products to resell. Thus, higher volume
translates into lower unit prices. The result appears in Exhibit 5.5, where the revenue
per unit gradually declines despite a continuing rise in unit volume, which causes a
much slower increase in profits than would be the case if revenues rose in a straight,
unaltered line.

The breakeven chart in Exhibit 5.5 may make management think twice before
pursuing a high-volume sales strategy, since profits will not necessarily increase. The
only way to be sure of the size of price discounts would be to begin negotiations with
resellers or to sell the product in test markets at a range of lower prices to determine
changes in volume. Otherwise, management is operating in a vacuum of relevant data.
Also, in some cases the only way to survive is to keep cutting prices in pursuit of

greater volume, since there are no high-priced market niches in which to sell. For
example, would anyone buy a flat panel color television set for more than a slight price
premium? Of course not; this market is so intensely competitive that all competitors
must continually pursue a strategy of selling at the smallest possible unit price.

The breakeven chart previously noted in Exhibit 5.5 is a good example of what the
breakeven analysis really looks like in the marketplace. Fixed costs jump at different
capacity levels, variable costs decline at various volume levels, and unit prices drop
with increases in volume. Given the fluidity of the model, it is reasonable to
periodically revisit it in light of continuing changes in the marketplace in order to
update assumptions and make better calculations of breakeven points and projected
profit levels.

PROFITABILITY?

 

Product mix has an enormous impact on corporate profits, except for those very rare
cases where all products happen to have the same profit margins. To determine how

shown in Exhibit 5.6, that contains the number of units sold and the standard margin
for each product or product line, and the resulting gross margin dollars. The resulting
average margin will impact the denominator in the standard breakeven formula. For
example, if the average mix for a month’s sales results in a gross margin of 40 percent,
and fixed costs for the period were $50,000, the breakeven point would be $50,000/40
percent, or $125,000. If the product mix for the following month were to result in a
gross margin of 42 percent, the breakeven point would shift downward to $50,000/42
percent, or $119,048. Thus, changes in product mix will alter the breakeven point by
changing the gross margin number that is part of the breakeven formula.

5-6 HOW DO I CONDUCT A “WHAT-IF” ANALYSIS WITH
A SINGLE VARIABLE?

 

When the accountant must determine the answer to a formula where one element
varies, the simplistic approach is to create a table containing all possible expected
values of the variable, and calculate the answer for each one. Though workable, this
approach is slow. Instead, consider using the table-fill function of Excel to more
rapidly develop an answer. An example is shown in Exhibits 5.7 through 5.9. In
Exhibit 5.7, we have set up a formula to determine the present value of a series of
payments of $1,500 per payment, extending over eight periods. However, the interest
rate could vary, so a results table has been created below the present value calculation,
showing a range of possible interest rates in quarter-percent increments. Comment
fields show the present value calculation in cell C8, and also show that the information
appearing in cells B12 and C12 at the top of the results table are references from cells
C4 and C8, respectively. All other interest rates shown in cells B13 to B32 are typed in.
The main task remaining is to fill in the present value for each of the interest rates
shown in the results table. We could recreate the present value calculation next to each
of those interest rates, but there is an alternative approach.

The alternative method is to highlight the range of cells from B12 to C32, and
then access the Data, Table command in Excel. This results in the screen shown in
Exhibit 5.8, where a data entry pop-up screen asks where the input value comes from
(the interest rate field in cell C4), and whether we want the results to appear vertically in
acolumn, or horizontally in a row. Since we want the present value results to appear ina

The problem becomes more difficult when there are two variables in the formula,
since the range of possible answers becomes much greater. In this case, the use of
automation tools becomes more helpful to the controller, since the alternative is to
manually create a large number of formulas.

Exhibit 5.10 Layout of a Double-Variable Table

We will continue with the present value example used for single-variable
analysis to illustrate how double variables can be addressed. In Exhibit 5.10,
we assume that both the interest rate and the duration of payments may vary,
which yields a large number of possible present values that shall be con-
tained within a grid covering cells C13 to G33. Possible interest rates are listed
down the left side of this grid, as was the case for the single-variable calculation,


5-8 How Do | Calculate Cost Variances? 121

while the number of possible periods is displayed in a row across the top of the
grid.

For the double-variable calculation to function properly, the present value result
cell must be placed in the top-left corner of the results table, where the column and
row headings intersect. The point of this intersection is cell B12, which in turn
references the present value result cell, which is located at cell C8.

The next step is to reformat cell B12 to identify it as “Interest Rate,” even while
the underlying formula is still present. To achieve this step, click on cell B12
and then access the Format, Cell commands in Excel. This will bring up the Format
Cells screen, which is shown in Exhibit 5.11. As shown in the exhibit, click on the
“Custom” field under the Category heading, then select the “‘General”’ option under
the Type heading, and enter ‘‘Interest Rate”’ in the Type data entry field. The number
in cell B12 will be replaced with the words ‘Interest Rate,” though the underlying
formula will still be present.

Next, highlight cells B12 through G33, which places cell B12 in the upper-
left corner of the results table. This tells Excel the location of the present value
calculation that it will replicate throughout the results table. Then access the Data,
Table command in Excel. This creates a data entry pop-up screen, as shown in
Exhibit 5.12, which asks for the source of the number of periods in the present value
calculation (which is cell C5), as well as the source of the interest rates to be used in
the same calculation (which is cell C4).

After completing the data entry pop-up screen and clicking on OK, Excel
automatically populates the results table with a complete set of present values
for all interest rates and periods listed in the table. The final result is shown in
Exhibit 5.13.

 

5-8 HOW DO I CALCULATE COST VARIANCES?

 

There are many types of cost variance, which fall into the two general categories
of price and efficiency variances. The price variance is the difference between the
standard and actual price paid for anything, multiplied by the number of units of each
item purchased. The derivations of price variances for materials, wages, variable
overhead, and fixed overhead are as follows:

¢ Materials price variance. This is based on the actual price paid for materials
used in the production process, minus their standard cost, multiplied by the
number of units used. It is typically reported to the purchasing manager. This
calculation is a bit more complicated than it at first seems, since the actual cost is
probably either the LIFO, FIFO, or average cost of an item. Here are some
additional areas to investigate if there is a materials price variance:

° The standard price is based on a different purchase volume.

° The standard price is incorrectly derived from a different component.

ces manager because this person is responsible for setting the allowable wage
rates that employees are paid. This tends to be a relatively small variance, as long
as the standard labor rate is regularly revised to match actual labor rates in the
production facility. Since most job categories tend to be clustered into rela-
tively small pay ranges, there is not much chance that a labor price variance will

become excessive. Here are some areas to investigate if there is a labor price

variance:

° The standard labor rate has not been recently adjusted to reflect actual pay

changes.

° The actual labor rate includes overtime or shift differentials that were not

included in the standard.


5-8 How Do | Calculate Cost Variances? 125

° The staffing of jobs is with employees whose pay levels are different from those
used to develop standards for those jobs.

* Variable overhead spending variance. To calculate this variance, subtract the
standard variable overhead cost per unit from the actual cost incurred, and
multiply the remainder by the total unit quantity of output. This is very similar
to the material and labor price variances, since there are some overhead costs
that are directly related to the volume of production, as is the case for materials
and labor. The detailed report on this variance is usually sent to the production
manager, who is responsible for all overhead incurred in the production area.
This variance can require considerable analysis, for there may be a number of
costs that fall into this category, all of which may be hiding significant
variances. Here are some areas to investigate if there is a variable overhead
spending variance:

° The cost of activities in any of the variable overhead accounts has been altered
by the supplier.

° The company has altered its purchasing methods for the variable overhead costs
to or from the use of blanket purchase orders (which tend to result in lower
prices due to higher purchase volumes).

° Costs are being misclassified between the accounts, so that the spending
variance appears too low in one account and too high in another.

¢ Fixed overhead spending variance. This is the total amount by which fixed
overhead costs exceed their total standard cost for the reporting period. Notice
that, unlike the preceding price variance definitions, this one is not multiplied by
any type of production volume. There is no way to relate this price variance to
volume, since it is not directly tied to any sort of activity volume. The detailed
variance report on this topic may be distributed to a number of people, depending
on who is responsible for each general ledger account number that it contains.
Investigation of variances in this area generally centers on a period-to-period
comparison of prices charged to suppliers, with particular attention to those
experiencing recent price increases. It may be beneficial to link this investigation
to asummary of all contractual agreements with suppliers, since these documents
will reveal any allowable pricing changes; only those not allowed by such
agreements will still require further investigation.

The efficiency variance is the difference between the actual and standard usage
of a resource, multiplied by the standard price of that resource. The efficiency
variance applies to materials, labor, and variable overhead. It does not apply to
fixed overhead costs, since these costs are incurred independently from any
resource usage. Here is a closer examination of the efficiency variance, as applied
to each of these areas:

¢ Materials yield variance. Though its traditional name is slightly different, this
is still an efficiency variance. It measures the ability of a company to manufacture


126 Management Accounting Best Practices

a product using the exact amount of materials allowed by the standard. A variance
will arise if the quantity of materials used differs from the preset standard. It is
calculated by subtracting the total standard quantity of materials that are
supposed to be used from the actual level of usage, and multiplying the remainder
by the standard price per unit. This information is usually issued to the production
manager. Here are some of the areas to investigate to correct the material yield
variance:

° Excessive machine-related scrap rates

° Poor material quality levels

° Excessively tight tolerance for product rejections
° Improper machine setup

° Substitute materials that cause high reject rates

¢ Labor efficiency variance. This measures the ability of a company’s direct
labor staff to create products with the exact amount of labor set forth in the
standard. A variance will arise if the quantity of labor used is different from the
standard; note that this variance has nothing to do with the cost per unit of labor
(which is the price variance), only the quantity of it that is consumed. It is
calculated by subtracting the standard quantity of labor consumed from the
actual amount, and multiplying the remainder times the standard labor rate per
hour. As was the case for the material yield variance, it is most commonly
reported to the production manager. Here are the likely causes of the labor
efficiency variance:

° Employees have poor work instructions.

° Employees are not adequately trained.

° Too many employees are staffing a workstation.

° The wrong mix of employees is staffing a workstation.

° The labor standard used as a comparison is incorrect.

¢ Variable overhead efficiency variance. This measures the quantity of variable
overhead required to produce a unit of production. For example, if the machine
used to run a batch of product requires extra time to produce each product,
there will be an additional charge to the product’s cost that is based on the price of
the machine, multiplied by its cost per minute. This variance is not concerned
with the machine’s cost per minute (which would be examined through a price
variance analysis), but with the number of minutes required for the production of
each unit. It is calculated by subtracting the budgeted units of activity on which
the variable overhead is charged from the actual units of activity, times the
standard variable overhead cost per unit. Depending on the nature of the costs that
make up the pool of variable overhead costs, this variance may be reported to
several managers, particularly the production manager. The causes of this
variance will be tied to the unit of activity on which it is based. For example,

if the variable overhead rate varies directly with the quantity of machine time
used, then the main causes will be any action that changes the rate of machine
usage. If the basis is the amount of materials used, then the causes will be those

just noted for the materials yield variance.

5-9 HOW DO I CONDUCT A PROFITABILITY ANALYSIS
FOR SERVICES?

 

In the services industry, employee billable hours constitute the prime criterion for
overall corporate profitability. Financial analysis should encompass the following
three factors, which encompass the primary determinants of profitability in the
services sector:

1. Percentage of time billed
Full labor cost per hour
3. Billing price per hour

N

The percentage of time billed can be easily tracked with a spreadsheet, such as the
one shown in Exhibit 5.15, where billable employee time is listed by week, with a
month-to-date billable percentage listed not only by employee, but also for the entire
company. This approach easily highlights any staff who is not meeting minimum
billable targets.

In the exhibit, note the ““Workdays”’ row at the bottom, which indicates the number
of standard working days in each week of the report, as well as the maximum number
of hours that employees can bill during the month. The exhibit shows that more than
100 percent of possible employee hours were billed during the first week of February,
due to the billable overtime hours worked by T. Chubby. However, J. Abrams later
becomes unbillable, resulting in only a 46 percent billable percentage for that
employee by the end of the month. In total, the group has an 82 percent billable
percentage during the month.

The full labor cost per hour encompasses not only the hourly rate paid per
employee, but also the hourly cost of payroll taxes, various types of insurance, and
other benefits (net of deductions paid by employees). Exhibit 5.16 shows the
calculation of the full labor cost per hour for several employees.

A key consideration is that, if the employees providing services are being
paid on a salary basis, then any overtime hours worked by them that are billable
to customers represent a pure profit increase, since there is no offsetting labor
cost.

The price billed per hour means little unless it is compared with the full labor
rate cost per hour, thereby arriving at the margin being earned on each hour worked.
Otherwise, a high hourly cost could entirely offset an otherwise impressive bill-
ing rate, resulting in no profitability for the company. Exhibit 5.17 shows how the
billing rate, full labor cost per hour, and billable percentage can be combined to reveal
a complete picture of profitability for billable employees.

In the exhibit, the billable percentage for J. Abrams has dropped so low that the
net billing rate per hour is less than that employee’s fully burdened labor cost per
hour; the solution is to either increase the billing rate, increase the billable per-
centage, reduce the employee’s cost, or terminate the employee. The situation for
the third employee on the list, T. Chubby, is somewhat different. We assume that
Chubby does not receive extra overtime pay; if this were not the case, then the labor
cost per hour in the exhibit would increase substantially to include the cost of an
overtime premium.

The analysis in Exhibit 5.17 could also include a charge for a commission
percentage, on the grounds that a salesperson is being paid a commission for having
obtained the services contract under which the employee is now billable.

Another use for Exhibit 5.17 is to calculate the breakeven billable percentage for
each employee, which management can then use as a minimum billable target. This
information can be determined by shifting the information in the exhibit slightly and
revising the calculation, as shown in Exhibit 5.18.

The analysis in Exhibit 5.18 reveals a different aspect of the situation; though
J. Abrams is currently not profitable, a relatively low billing percentage of 49 percent
will result in a profit. Conversely, though T. Chubby is currently profitable on an
hourly basis, the breakeven analysis reveals that a much higher billable percentage is

required to maintain this situation, because the margin on Chubby’s services is lower
than for the other two employees.

The analysis of profitability for services is nearly complete, and excludes
only the consideration of corporate overhead. The gross margins noted for
employees in Exhibit 5.17 must be extrapolated by the total number of hours
worked in the reporting period to arrive at the grand total gross margin earned
during the period. Overhead expenses are then compared with this figure to
determine the profit or loss for the period, as shown in Exhibit 5.19. The exhibit
reveals that the company must either pare overhead expenses drastically, obtain
additional billable staff, or greatly increase the gross margin per hour of the
existing employees in order to earn a profit.

5-10 HOW ARE PROFITS AFFECTED BY THE NUMBER
OF DAYS IN A MONTH?

 

In a service-related business, the prime focus of conversation usually includes
such factors as billable rates per hour and the percentage of billable time. However, a
third factor is worth a considerable amount of attention, as well: the number of
business days in the month. Using the standard number of federal holidays in the

Figure out the number of business days it takes for the consulting or service
business to break even. If it takes 21 business days, then the company will lose money
in7 months out of 12. If it takes 22 or 23 business days, then there is a real problem. If
this appears to be an issue, calculate the expense reduction required to reduce the
breakeven point by one incremental day. This is an excellent approach for monitoring
how well the business is structured to make money throughout the year.

5-11 HOW DO I DECIDE WHICH RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TO FUND?

 

The traditional approach is to require all R&D proposals to pass a minimum return-
on-investment hurdle rate. However, when there is limited funding available and too
many investments passing the hurdle rate to all be funded, managers tend to pick the
projects most likely to succeed. This selection process usually results in the least risky
projects being funded, which are typically extensions of existing product lines or other
variations on existing products that will not achieve breakthrough profitability. An
alternative that is more likely to achieve a higher return on R&D investment is to
apportion investable funds into multiple categories: a large percentage that is only to
be used for highly risky projects with associated high returns, and a separate pool
of funds specifically designated for lower-risk projects with correspondingly lower
levels of return. The exact proportions of funding allocated to each category will
depend on management’s capacity for risk, as well as the size and number of available
projects in each category. This approach allows a company the opportunity to
achieve a breakthrough product introduction that it would probably not have
funded if a single hurdle rate had been used to evaluate new product proposals.

If this higher-risk approach to allocating funds is used, it is likely that a num-
ber of new product projects will be abandoned prior to their release into the
market, on the grounds that they will not yield a sufficient return on investment
or will not be technologically or commercially feasible. This is not a bad situa-
tion, since some projects are bound to fail if a sufficiently high level of project


132 Management Accounting Best Practices

risk is acceptable to management. Conversely, if no projects fail, this is a clear
sign that management is not investing in sufficiently risky investments. To mea-
sure the level of project failure, calculate R&D waste, which is the amount of
unrealized product development spending (e.g., the total expenditure on canceled
projects during the measurement period). Even better, divide the amount of R&D
waste by the total R&D expenditure during the period to determine the proportion
of expenses incurred on failed projects. Unfortunately, this measure can be easily
manipulated by accelerating or withholding the declaration of project termination.
Nonetheless, it does give a fair indication of project risk when aggregated over the
long term.

Though funding may be allocated into broad investment categories, manage-
ment must still use a reliable method for determining which projects will receive
funding and which will not. The standard approach is to apply a discount rate to
all possible projects, and then to select those having the highest net present
value (NPV). However, the NPV calculation does not include several key vari-
ables found in the expected commercial value (ECV) formula, making the ECV
the preferred method. The ECV formula requires one to multiply a prospective
project’s net present value by the probability of its commercial success, minus
the commercialization cost, and then multiply the result by the probability of
technical success, minus the development cost. Thus, the intent of using ECV is to
include all major success factors into the decision to accept or reject a new product
proposal. The formula is as follows:

(((Project net present value x Probability of commercial success)
—Commercialization cost) x (Probability of technical success))
— Product development cost

As an example of the use of ECV, the Moravia Corporation collects the follow-
ing information about a new project for a battery-powered lawn trimmer, where
there is some technical risk that a sufficiently powerful battery cannot be developed
for the product:

 

Project net present value $4,000,000
Probability of commercial success 90%
Commercialization cost $750,000
Probability of technical success 65%
Product development cost $1,750,000

 

Based on this information, Moravia computes the following ECV for the lawn
trimmer project:

((($4,000,000 Project net present value x 90% Probability of commercial success)
—$750,000 Commercialization cost) x (65% Probability of technical success))
—$1,750,000 Product development cost

Expected commercial value = $102,500


5-12 How Do | Create a Throughput Analysis Model? 133

Even if some projects are dropped after being run through the preceding valuation
analysis, this does not mean that they should be canceled for good. On the contrary,
these projects may become commercially viable over time, depending on changes in
price points, costs, market conditions, and technical viability. Consequently, the R&D
manager should conduct a periodic review of previously shelved projects to see
whether any of the factors just noted have changed sufficiently to allow the company
to reintroduce a project proposal for development.

5-12 HOW DO | CREATE A THROUGHPUT
ANALYSIS MODEL?

 

The primary focus of throughput accounting is on how to force as many through-
put dollars as possible through the capacity constraint. It does this by first deter-
mining the throughput dollars per minute of every production job scheduled to run
through the capacity constraint, and rearranging the order of production priority
so that the products with the highest throughput dollars per minute are completed
first. The system is based on the supposition that only a certain amount of production
can be squeezed through a bottleneck operation, so the production that yields
the highest margin must come first in order of production scheduling priority, to
ensure that profits are maximized. The concept is most easily demonstrated in the
example shown in Exhibit 5.20.

In the example, we have four types of products that a company can sell. Each
requires some machining time on the company’s capacity constraint, which is the
circuit board manufacturing process (CBMP). The first item is a 19” color television,
which requires four minutes of the CBMP’s time. The television sells for $100.00, and
has associated direct materials of $67.56, which gives it a throughput of $32.44 (the
price and direct materials cost are not shown in the exhibit, merely inferred). We then
divide the throughput of $32.44 by the four minutes of processing time per unit on the
capacity constraint to arrive at the throughput dollars per minute of $8.11 that is shown
in the second column of the exhibit. We then calculate the throughput per minute for
the other three products, and sort them in high-low order, based on which ones
contribute the most throughput per minute. This leaves the 19” color television at the
top of the list. Next, we multiply the scheduled production for each item by the time
required to move it through the constrained resource. We do this for all four products,
and verify that the total planned time required for the constraint operation is equal to or
less than the actual time available at the constraint, as shown in the ‘Total planned
constraint time’’ row. In the exhibit, the maximum available constraint time is listed in
bold as 8,000 minutes, which is the approximate usage level for an eight-hour day ina
21-day month of business days, assuming 80 percent efficiency. This number will vary
dramatically, depending on the number of shifts used, scrap levels, and the efficiency
of operation of the constrained resource.

A key concept is that the maximum number of units of the highest throughput-
per-minute item (in this case, the 19” color television) is to be sold, as well as the

maximum volume for each product listed below it. Only the production volume of
the product listed at the bottom of the table (in this case, the 42” plasma television)
will be reduced in order to meet the limitations of the constrained resource. The
amount of planned production as well as the amount of potential sales are shown in
the “Units of Scheduled Production’? column of the throughput model. For
example, ‘500/500’ is shown in this column for the 19” color television, which
means that there are 500 units of potential sales for this product, and the company
plans to produce all 500 units. Only for the last product in the table, the 42” plasma
television, do the units of production not match the potential sales (180 units are
being produced instead of the 400 units of potential sales). By doing so, a company
can maximize throughput.


5-13 How Do | Determine whether More Volume 135

Then, by multiplying the throughput per minute by the number of minutes for each
product, and then multiplying the result by the total number of units produced, we
arrive at the total throughput for each product, as shown in the final column, as well as
for the entire production process for the one-month period, which is $52,085. How-
ever, we are not done yet. We must still subtract from the total throughput the sum
of all operating expenses for the facility, which is $47,900 in the exhibit. After they
are subtracted from the total throughput, we find that we have achieved a profit of
8.0 percent and a return on investment (annualized, since the results of the model are
only for a one-month period) of 15.7 percent.

This is the basic throughput financial analysis model, incorporating all the key
throughput analysis elements of throughput dollars, operating expenses, and return
on investment. It will be used as the foundation for several additional financial
analysis scenarios later in this chapter. When reviewing a proposal with this
model, one must review the impact of the decision on the incremental change in net
profit caused by a change in throughput minus operating expenses, divided by the
change in investment. If there is an incremental improvement in the model, then
the proposed decision should be accepted. The model makes it easy to determine
the exact amount of system improvement (or degradation) occurring by incre-
mentally changing one element of the production system.

5-13 HOW DO | DETERMINE WHETHER MORE VOLUME
AT A LOWER PRICE CREATES MORE PROFIT?

 

What happens when a customer indicates that a very large order is about to be issued—
but only if the company grants a significant price reduction? The typical analysis is for
the accountants to determine the fully burdened cost of the product in question,
compare it with the low requested price, and then reject the proposal out of hand
because they state that the company cannot cover its overhead costs at such a low price
point. Conversely, the sales manager will ram through approval of the proposal, on the
grounds that “‘we will make up the loss with higher volume.” Which is right? Based on
their logic, neither one, because they are not considering the net impact of this
proposal on total system throughput. Perhaps the following example will clarify the
situation.

The sales manager of the electronics company in our previous example runs into
the corporate headquarters, flush from a meeting with the company’s largest account,
Electro-Geek Stores (EGS). He has just agreed to a deal that drops the price of the 32”
LCD television by 20 percent, but which guarantees a doubling in the quantity of EGS
orders for this product for the upcoming year. The sales manager points out that the
company may have to hold off ona few of the smaller-volume production runs of other
products, but it’s no problem—the company is bound to earn more money on the extra
volume. To test this assumption, the accountant pulls up the throughput model on his
computer, shifts the LCD TV to the top of the priority list, adjusts the throughput to
reflect the lower price, and obtains the results shown in Exhibit 5.21.

To be brief, the sales manager just skewered the company. By dropping the price
of the LCD television by 20 percent, much of the product’s throughput was eli-
minated, while so much of the capacity constraint was used up that there was little
room for the production of any other products that might generate enough added
throughput to save the company. Specifically, because of its low level of throughput
dollars per minute, the planned production of the 42” plasma television had to be
dropped from 180 units to just 25, nearly eliminating the throughput of this product.

This example clearly shows that one must carefully consider the impact on the
capacity constraint when debating whether to accept a high-volume sales deal. This is a
particularly dangerous area in which to ignore throughput accounting, for the accep-
tance of a really large-volume deal can demand all of the time of the capacity constraint,
eliminating any chance for the company to manufacture other products, and thereby
eliminating any chance of offering a wide product mix to the general marketplace.


5-15 Should | Add Staff to the Bottleneck Operation? 137

5-14 SHOULD | OUTSOURCE PRODUCTION?

 

Acommon decision to consider is whether to outsource production. The usual analysis
will focus on the reduced margin that the company will earn, since the supplier will
likely charge a higher price than the company can achieve if it keeps the work in-house.
However, the correct view of the situation is whether the company can earn more
throughput on a combination of the outsourced production and the additional new
production that will now be available through the constrained resource.

For example, one of the company’s key suppliers has offered to take over the entire
production of the 50” high-definition television, package it in the company’s boxes,
and drop ship the completed goods directly to the company’s customers. The catch is
that the company’s throughput per unit will decrease from its current $62.10 to
$30.00. The cost accounting staff would likely reject this deal, on the grounds that
profits would be reduced. To see if this is a good deal, we turn once again to the
throughput model, which is reproduced in Exhibit 5.22. In this exhibit, we have
removed the number from the ‘“‘Units of Scheduled Production’’ column for the high-
definition television, since it can now be produced without the use of the capacity
constraint. However, we are still able to put a cumulative throughput dollar figure into
the final column for this product, since there is some margin to be made by outsourcing
it through the supplier. By removing the high-definition television’s usage of the
capacity constraint, we are now able to produce more of the next product in line, which
is the plasma television set. This additional production allows the company to increase
the amount of throughput dollars, thereby creating $3,885 more profits than was the
case before the outsourcing deal.

The traditional cost accounting approach would have stated that profits would be
lowered by accepting an outsourcing deal that clearly cost more than the product’s
internal cost. However, by using this deal to release some capacity at the bottleneck,
the company is able to earn more money on the production of other products.

5-15 SHOULD | ADD STAFF TO THE BOTTLENECK
OPERATION?

 

When a company starts using constraint management as its guiding principle in
managing throughput, an early area of decision making will be how to increase the
output of the constrained resource. An obvious first step is to add staff to it, with
the intent of achieving faster equipment setup time, less equipment downtime, more
operational efficiency per machine, and so on. As long as the incremental increase in
throughput exceeds the cost of each staff person added to the constraint, this should
be a logical step to take. However, traditional accounting analysis will likely find that
the additional labor assigned to the constrained resource will not be needed at all times
and would therefore have a low level of efficiency, and would reject the proposal.

For example, the company realizes that it can vastly reduce job setup time by
adding an employee to the constrained resource, thereby increasing the maximum

constraint time from 8,000 minutes per month to 8,800 minutes. Due to scheduling
issues, the employee must be assigned to the constrained resource for an entire eight-
hour day, even though she is only needed for a total of one hour per day. Her cost is
$25 per hour, or $4,200 per month ($25/hour x 8 hours x 21 business days). The
result of this change is shown in Exhibit 5.23.

The exhibit reveals that the company can use the extra capacity to build more units
of the 42” plasma television, resulting in $5,160 of additional throughput that, even
when offset against the $4,200 additional labor cost (which has been added to the
operating expense line item), still results in an incremental profit improvement of
$960. The main problem is that the employee will be working on the constrained
resource for only one hour out of eight, which is a 12.5 percent utilization percentage
that will certainly draw the attention of the accounting staff. Consequently, low

incremental labor efficiency on the constrained resource can make sense if the

5-16 SHOULD | PRODUCE A NEW PRODUCT?

 

When adding a new product that requires use of the constrained resource, manage-
ment may be startled to find that profits actually decline as a result of the introduction,
because the new product eliminated an old product that yielded more throughput per
minute. The traditional cost accounting system will not spot this problem, because it
focuses on the profitability of a product, rather than the amount of the constrained
resource needed to produce it.

5-16 Should | Produce a New Product? 141

For example, the company’s engineers have designed a new, lower-cost 32”
LCD television to replace the existing model. The two products are compared in
Exhibit 5.24.

The traditional accountant would review this comparative exhibit and conclude
that the new model is clearly better, since it costs less to build, resulting in a profit $15
greater than the old model. However, the new model achieves less throughput per
minute, because its larger throughput is being spread over a substantial increase in the
required amount of time on the constrained resource. By replacing the old model with
the new model, we arrive at the results shown in Exhibit 5.25.

The model shows that profits have declined by $570, because the new model has
used up so much constraint time that the company is no longer able to produce as many
of the 42” plasma televisions. Furthermore, the throughput per minute on the new
product has declined so much that it is now ranked as the third most profitable product,

instead of occupying the new number-two position, as was the case for its predecessor
product.

Let us now modify the analysis so that the company’s product engineers have
spent their time reducing the required amount of constraint time for the 32” LCD
television, rather than in reducing its cost. In fact, let us assume that they increase
the product’s cost by $5 while reducing the amount of required constraint time
from six minutes to five minutes, which increases its throughput per minute to
$8.00. The result is shown in Exhibit 5.26, where the company’s total throughput
has increased because more time is now available at the constrained resource for
additional production of the plasma television. However, this new product intro-
duction would almost certainly have been canceled by the accountants because the
cost per unit would have increased.

Payroll Decisions

The payroll function has traditionally been highly labor-intensive, but available
technology now makes it possible to automate almost every aspect of the process,
leaving the payroll staff with only an oversight role, reviewing transactions for
errors.

To see how simplification can be achieved, it is easiest to first break down the
payroll function into three categories: inputs, processing, and outputs. In the
inputs category, the payroll staff is usually burdened with manual rekeying of
employee timecards, which can now be eliminated through the use of computerized
time clocks, Web-based timekeeping systems, and data entry by phone. In the
processing category, the payroll staff usually spends its time processing payroll
deductions, issuing and receiving forms, and calculating payments. These tasks
can now be automated with self-service portals, deduction management, and the
outsourcing of payroll processing. The final category is outputs, or payments to
employees, where the payroll staff traditionally creates and distributes checks.
Instead, it is now possible not only to pay employees by several electronic methods,
but also to post their remittance information on the Internet, rather than mailing it
to them.

This chapter clarifies how all of these payroll simplification techniques work. The
following table itemizes the section number in which the answers to each question can
be found:

6-1 HOW CAN | AUTOMATE TIME CLOCK
DATA COLLECTION?

 

The most labor-intensive task in the payroll area is calculating hours worked for
hourly employees. To do so, a payroll clerk must collect all of the employee timecards
for the most recently completed payroll period, manually accumulate the hours listed
on the cards, and discuss missing or excessive hours with supervisors. This is a lengthy
process with a high error rate, due to the large percentage of missing start or stop times
on timecards. Any errors are usually found by employees as soon as they are paid,
resulting in possibly confrontational visits to the payroll staff, demanding an
immediate adjustment to their pay with a manual check. These changes disrupt
the payroll department and introduce additional inefficiencies to the process.

The solution is to install a computerized time clock. This clock requires an
employee to swipe a uniquely identified card through a reader on its side. The card is
encoded with either a magnetic strip or a bar code that contains the employee’s
identification number. Once the swipe occurs, the clock automatically stores the date
and time, and downloads this information upon request to the payroll department’s
computer, where special software automatically calculates the hours worked and
also highlights any problems for additional research (such as missed card swipes).
Many of these clocks can be installed through a large facility or at outlying locations
so that employees can conveniently record their time, no matter where they may be.
More advanced clocks also track the time periods when employees are supposed to
arrive and leave, and require a supervisor’s password for card swipes outside of that
time period; this feature allows for greater control over employee work hours. Many of
these systems also issue absence reports, so that supervisors can tell who has not
shown up for work. Thus, an automated time clock eliminates much low-end clerical
work while at the same time providing new management tools for supervisors.

Before purchasing such a clock, be aware of its limitations. The most important
one is cost. This type of clock costs $2,000 to $3,000 each, or can be leased for several
hundred dollars per month. If several clocks are needed, this can add up to a substantial
investment. In addition, outlying time clocks that must download their information to
acomputer at a distant location may require their own phone line. There may also be a
fee for using the software on the central computer that summarizes all the incoming
payroll information. Given these costs, it is most common for bar-coded time clocks to
be used only in those situations where there are so many hourly employees that there is
a significant savings in the payroll department resulting from their installation.

One problem with the computerized time clock is that it suffers from an integrity
flaw—employees can use each other’s badges to enter and exit from the payroll
system. This means that some employees may be paid for hours when they were never
really on-site at all. The biometric time clock resolves this problem by requiring an
employee to place his or her hand on a sensor, which matches its size and shape to the
dimensions already recorded for that person in a central database. The time entered
into the terminal will then be recorded against the payroll file of the person whose
hand was just measured. Thus, only employees who are on-site can have payroll hours


6-2 How Do | Collect Time Information by Telephone? 145

credited to them. These systems have a secondary benefit, which is that no one
needs an employee badge or passkey; these tend to be lost or damaged over time
and so represent a minor headache for the accounting or human resources staffs,
who must track them. In a biometric monitoring environment, all an employee needs
is a hand.

Though the use of bar-coded or biometric time clocks certainly solves a variety of
timekeeping problems in environments where many employees are clustered
together, the approach does not work well where employees are scattered over a
wide area. It is not efficient for these employees to travel long distances to the time
clocks to record their time, and the clocks are too expensive to multiply into every
possible employee location. In these cases, consider setting up a Web-based time-
keeping system. Under this approach, employees call up a Web page that simulates a
timecard, and use it to enter their hours worked. By doing so, the payroll staff has no
keypunching duties at all, the online system can warn employees of obvious key-
punching errors on the spot, and timekeeping data is available much more quickly to
management.

Web-based timekeeping systems are becoming widely available through the
larger payroll outsourcing suppliers. These products include ADP’s ezLaborManager
product, Cignify Corporation’s PeopleNet product, and TALX Corporation’s Fast-
Time product. These products allow employees to charge time against a wide range
of labor accounts. Using one of these outsourced solutions is particularly appealing
if the payroll processing function is already outsourced, since the supplier can
automatically port the input data directly into its payroll application, resulting in
even less payroll processing work by the payroll department.

An alternative is to construct an in-house Web-based system, which may be more
useful in companies that have closely integrated their timekeeping systems to a job
billing system. Under this more customized approach, a logical configuration is to
have employees enter time not only against a job number, but also to a labor code
that translates into a specific billable hourly rate. The resulting reports should specify
exactly who worked on a customer project during what time period, how many hours
they worked, their billable rate, and the total charge being invoiced to the customer.
Though this type of system requires considerable programming effort, the result
is excellent automation not only of the timekeeping process, but of the billing process
as well.

6-2 HOW DO | COLLECT TIME INFORMATION
BY TELEPHONE?

 

The initial entry of timekeeping data remains a problem for many companies. They
can either install computerized timekeeping units on the company premises, or
require employees to log onto a Web-based system. The first solution requires a
capital investment of up to $2,000 per unit and keeping track of employee badges,
while the second solution requires everyone to have access to a computer. Until


146 Management Accounting Best Practices

recently, the only other solution was having employees fill out paper timesheets,
which the payroll staff would have to manually enter into the computer system (with
the usual data entry errors).

An interesting alternative is the telephone. Under this approach, the company buys
a rack-mounted server that contains an interactive voice response (IVR) system, and
links it to their phone system. Employees then call into the IVR system to enter their
time in response to a series of prompts. The capacity of the system ranges from one
employee to over 100,000.

An online demonstration IVR system has been set up by Telliris, Inc. To use it,
call 203-924-7000, extension 5000 and enter partner code 0000. Then use
employee number 00001 to enter a variety of transactions, such as clocking in
and out, reporting sick time, vacation time, bereavement, jury duty, and family
illness.

A timekeeping IVR system requires a reduced investment, since it takes advan-
tages of existing phones. Also, the system is so intuitive that employee training is
almost completely unnecessary. Furthermore, the system has built-in validation, to
avoid initial data entry errors by employees. It is even possible to limit phone calls to
specific telephone numbers (presumably originating from fixed phone locations),
so that employees can call in only from where they are supposed to be. This is a very
good solution for mobile employees, such as those involved with equipment servi-
cing, facilities maintenance, and health care. It is also useful for temporary employ-
ees, since the company would otherwise have to issue them an employee badge in
order to use any in-house timekeeping systems.

In addition to Telliris, timekeeping IVR systems are also offered by TimeLink and
TALX (though TALX’s FastTime solution is offered only to companies having more
than 3,500 employees).

6-3 HOW CAN | SIMPLIFY PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS?

 

A company can offer a large number of benefits to its employees, many of which
require some sort of deduction from payroll. For example, a company can set up
deductions for employee medical, dental, life, and supplemental life insurance, as
well as flexible spending account deductions for medical insurance or child care
payments, as well as 401(k) deductions and 401(k) loan deductions. If there are
many employees and many deduction types, the payroll staff can be snowed
under at payroll processing time by the volume of changes continually occurring
in this area. Also, whenever there is a change in the underlying cost of insurance
provided to the company, the company commonly passes along some portion
of these costs to the employees, resulting in a massive updating of deductions for
all employees who take that particular type of insurance. This not only takes
time away from other, more value-added payroll tasks, but also is subject to error,
so that adjustments must later be made to correct the errors, which requires even
more staff time.


6-4 How Do Employees Enter Their Own Payroll Changes? 147

There are several ways to address this problem. One is to eliminate the employee-
paid portion of some types of insurance. For example, if the cost to the company for
monthly dental insurance is $20 per employee and the related deduction is only $2 per
person, management can elect to pay for the entire cost, rather than burden the payroll
staff with the tracking of this trivial sum. Another alternative is to eliminate certain
types of benefits, such as supplemental life insurance or 401(k) loans, in order to
eliminate the related deductions. Yet another alternative is to create a policy that limits
employee changes to any benefit plans, so they can only make a small number of
changes per year. This eliminates the continual changing of deduction amounts in
favor of just a few large bursts of activity at prescheduled times during the year. A very
good alternative is to create a benefit package for all employees that requires a
single deduction of the same amount for everyone, or for a group (such as one
deduction for single employees and another for employees with families); employees
can then pick and choose the exact amount of each type of benefit they want within
the boundaries of each benefit package, without altering the amount of the under-
lying deduction. This last alternative has the unique advantage of consolidating all
deductions into a single item, which is much simpler to administer. Any of these
approaches to the problem will reduce the number or timing of deduction changes,
thereby reducing the workload of the payroll staff.

6-4 HOW DO EMPLOYEES ENTER THEIR OWN
PAYROLL CHANGES?

 

Employees always have some sort of data change they want to make in the payroll
system, such as changes to their direct deposit, withholding, address, name, and
marital status information. The payroll staff must make all of these changes, as well as
the inevitable corrections caused by errors in data entry. For example, when an
employee first wants to set up direct deposit, she forwards this information to the
payroll staff, which inputs it into whatever payroll software is in use. If the employee
forwards incorrect information or it is incorrectly keypunched into the system, it is
rejected and must be dealt with again during the next payroll cycle. In addition,
employees may switch bank accounts or want to split deposits into multiple accounts,
all of which require additional work by the payroll staff. Depending on the number of
employees, these types of changes can represent a significant ongoing effort.

The latest advance in the area of self-service is for payroll outsourcing companies
to manage self-service Web sites on behalf of their clients, who merely provide a link
to these sites from their intranet sites. A typical self-service site allows the payroll
manager to upload a variety of employee-centric documents, such as the employee
manual, company phone directory, payroll forms, and news releases. In addition to
these basic functions, the site also allows employees to access their pay statements and
W-2 forms, view their earnings history, check their remaining vacation time, see
performance reviews, view their 401(k) plan balances, and verify their benefits
elections.


148 Management Accounting Best Practices

An alternative is to construct this type of portal for an in-house legacy payroll
system, but the programming effort required is so substantial that a company must
have a considerable number of employees to make it worthwhile. An alternative
would be to install a self-service module if a company uses commercial off-the-shelf
payroll software that already provides this functionality.

Self-service portals can also be constructed for managers, who can input a
different set of information into the payroll system. This includes the setup and
deletion of employees from the payroll database, as well as the recording of payroll
events, such as employee pay raises, transfers, and employee leave situations.
Though a few outsourcing payroll suppliers offer manager portals, they are still
rare. Consequently, it may be necessary to construct a custom portal for managers.
If so, consider the following issues before constructing the system:

¢ Install data limit checkers. Managers may inadvertently enter incorrect infor-
mation that is patently false, such as a $1,000,000 salary, by not entering a
decimal place. The data entry system can include a number of data limit checkers
that will automatically reject data unless it falls within a tight parameter range.

¢ Require transaction-specific approvals. If a manager wants to give an employee
an inordinately large pay raise, the system should bring this raise to the attention
of the payroll staff or an upper-level manager, who must approve it before the
payroll database is updated with the new information.

¢ Issue warnings to affected departments. When a manager enters an employee
termination into the computer system, this should trigger a message to the
human resources department, which may want to conduct an exit interview.
Similarly, the 401(k) plan administrator needs to know about the termination
in order to send plan termination documents to the former employee; the
same goes for the health plan administrator, who must mail out a packet of
COBRA information. A number of similar notifications are needed at the point
of initial hire.

Thus, the manager self-service portal requires complex interfaces. It must
review input data, issue notifications and warnings, and generally take over the role
of an experienced payroll clerk to ensure that employee transition data is correctly
handled throughout the company. Given the complexity of this portal, itis generally
best to roll out only one function at a time, to ensure that sufficient system testing is
conducted.

6-5 HOW DO! AUTOMATE PAYROLL FORM DISTRIBUTION?

 

Employees frequently come to the payroll department to ask for any of the variety
of forms required for changes to their payroll status, such as the IRS’s W-4 form,
address changes, flexible spending account sign-up or change forms, and so on.


6-6 Should | Pay Employees via Direct Deposit? 149

These constant interruptions interfere with the orderly flow of payroll work,
especially when the department runs out of a form and must scramble to replenish
its supplies.

This problem is neatly solved by converting all forms to Adobe Acrobat’s PDF
format and posting them on a company intranet site for downloading by all
employees. By using this approach, no one ever has to approach the payroll staff
for the latest copy of a form. Also, employees can download the required form
from anywhere, rather than having to wait until they are near the payroll location
to physically pick one up. Further, the payroll staff can regularly update the
PDF forms on the intranet site, so there is no risk of someone using an old and
outmoded form.

Converting a regular form to PDF format is simple. First, purchase the Acrobat
software from Adobe’s Web site and install it. Then access a form in whatever
software package it was originally constructed, and print it to “PDF Acrobat,” which
will now appear on the list of printers. There are no other steps—your PDF format is
complete! The IRS also uses the PDF format for its forms, which can be downloaded
from the www.irs.gov site and posted to the company intranet site.

6-6 SHOULD | PAY EMPLOYEES VIA DIRECT DEPOSIT?

 

A major task for the payroll staff is to issue paychecks to employees. This task can be
subdivided into several steps. First, the checks must be printed; though it seems easy, it
is all too common for the check run to fail, resulting in the manual cancellation of the
first batch of checks, followed by a new print run. Next, the checks must be signed by
an authorized check signer, who may have questions about payment amounts that may
require additional investigation. After that, the checks must be stuffed into envelopes
and then sorted by supervisor (since supervisors generally hand out paychecks to their
employees). The checks are then distributed, usually with the exception of a few
checks that will be held for those employees who are not currently on-site for later
pickup. If checks are stolen or lost, the payroll staff must cancel them and manually
issue replacements. Finally, the person in charge of the bank reconciliation must track
those checks that have not been cashed and follow up with employees to get them to
cash their checks—there are usually a few employees who prefer to cash checks only
when they need the money, surprising though this may seem. In short, there are a
startlingly large number of steps involved in issuing payroll checks to employees.
How can we eliminate this work?

We can eliminate the printing and distribution of paychecks by using direct
deposit, which involves issuing payments directly to employee bank accounts.
Besides avoiding some of the steps involved with issuing paychecks, it carries the
additional advantage of putting money in employee bank accounts at once, so that
those employees who are off-site on payday do not have to worry about how they will
receive their money—it will appear in their checking accounts automatically, with no
effort on their part. Also, there is no longer a problem with asking employees to cash


150 Management Accounting Best Practices

their checks, since it is done automatically. Further, there is no longer any need to have
an elaborate set of controls designed to store and track unused checks.

It can be difficult to get employees to switch over to direct deposit. Though
the benefits to employees may seem obvious, there will be some portion of employees
who prefer to cash their own checks or who do not have bank accounts. To get around
this problem, an organization can either force all employees to accept direct deposit,
or do so only with new employees (while existing employees are allowed to continue
taking paychecks). If employees are forced to accept direct deposit, the company can
either arrange with a local bank to give them bank accounts, or issue the funds to a
debit card ). Some companies also use raffles and other promotional devices to reward
those employees who switch to direct deposit.

Another problem is the cost of this service. A typical charge by the bank is $0.50
for each transfer made, which can add up to a considerable amount if there are many
employees and/or many pay periods per year. However, banks also charge a fee to
process checks, so the net cost of processing a direct deposit instead of a check is
relatively low. Also, this problem can be reduced by shrinking the number of pay
periods per year. Also, one must factor in the time lost when employees go to the bank
to deposit their checks; this factor alone makes the switch to direct deposit a cost-
effective one.

Implementing direct deposit requires the transfer of payment information to
the company’s bank in the correct direct deposit format, which the bank uses to
shift money to employee bank accounts. This information transfer can be
accomplished either by purchasing an add-on to a company’s in-house payroll
software, or by paying extra to a payroll outsourcing company to provide the
service; either way, there is an expense associated with starting up the service. If
there is some trouble with finding an intermediary to make direct deposits, this
can also be done through a Web site that specializes in direct deposits. For
example, www.directdeposit.com provides this service, and even has upload links
from a number of popular accounting packages, such as ACCPAC, DacEasy, and
Great Plains.

Also, some paper-based form of notification should still be sent to employees,
so that they know the details of what they have been paid. This means that using
direct deposit will not eliminate the steps of printing a deposit advice, stuffing it in
an envelope, and distributing it. An alternative is to send remittance information
to employees in an electronic format, which is dealt with later in this chapter in Sec-
tion 6-10 (“How do I automate payroll remittances?’’).

6-7 HOW DO PAYCARDS COMPARE WITH PAYMENTS
BY DIRECT DEPOSIT?

 

A paycard is a debit card into which employee pay is deposited. The original reason
for payroll cards was to provide funds for unbanked employees. This is not a small
group, numbering about 30 million in the United States alone, but it does not apply to


6-7 How Do Paycards Compare with Payments by Direct Deposit? 151

many employers who have few unbanked employees, and who are probably already
paying their employees via direct deposit. However, payroll card features have
gradually expanded, making them more competitive with direct deposit. Payroll
cards are superior to direct deposit in the following respects:

¢ First payment is electronic. When paying an employee through direct deposit,
the first payment to a new employee is with a check, since the bank wants to
prenote the first direct deposit transaction. This is not the case for a payroll card,
where the first payment can be issued electronically.

¢ Data collection. Direct deposit requires the employer to collect bank routing and
account number information from employees, which may be incorrect or difficult
to obtain. This is not needed for payroll cards, since the employer creates each
account.

* Account lockdown. Employees sometimes shut down their bank accounts and
forget to inform the company that direct deposit payments must now be sent to a
new location. Since the employer controls the payroll card account, employees
cannot shut down the account.

¢ Termination pay. Terminated employees can be paid within one day through a
payroll card, and there is no need for them to come back to the office to pick up a
final check.

¢ Information security. Unlike direct deposit, an employer does not need to retain
personal banking information for payroll cards, since it is setting up all accounts.

¢ Additional cards. Some card providers will issue extra payroll cards to other
family members, which allows them to withdraw funds in other cities; this keeps
the wage earner from paying wire transfer fees to send money to other family
members.

¢ Pay routing. Some card providers now allow card users to automatically route
incoming funds to personal bank accounts, though there is a one-day delay in the
funds transfer.

Payroll cards have the following additional benefits over paychecks:

© Check cashing time and cost. There is no need to wait in a bank line, since funds
are sent electronically and can be withdrawn at any ATM. There is also no check
cashing fee, though there may be an ATM fee.

* Unclaimed property. Since there is no check that an employee might not cash,
there is no unclaimed property to track.

Do these benefits mean that it is time to convert to payroll cards? Most employees
will probably stay with direct deposit, because they are accustomed to this payment
approach. However, look for payroll cards to gradually encroach on the direct deposit
and paycheck turf over the next few years.


152 Management Accounting Best Practices

6-8 WHAT ISSUES SHOULD | CONSIDER WHEN SETTING
UP A PAYCARD PROGRAM?

 

Here are some considerations regarding the setup of a paycard program:

* Withdrawal fees. Employees should not have to pay a withdrawal fee when they
extract funds from an ATM (in some states, it is illegal to require employees to
pay such a fee as part of their payroll payments). Accordingly, either have the
company pay the ATM fee, or have the paycard supplier specify in its contract
which ATMs will offer free services to employees. It is also possible to set up an
on-site company-owned ATM, which ensures that ATM fees will be free.

* Card fees. Paycard issuers can impose a blizzard of fees, such as fees for an
excessive number of paycard transactions, card replacements, a “‘load fee” (when
a card is funded), and a monthly fee. First, be sure than none of these fees are
charged to employees, only the company. Second, write limitations into the
contract on increases in these fees, as well as the exclusion of as-yet unspecified
fees. Also, it is helpful to model the full cost of all fees, using reasonable
estimates of card usage, in order to determine which paycard program is the most
economical.

¢ Bank insurance. Some paycard issuers are not banks, so funds issued to paycards
maintained by them could be lost if the issuer goes out of business. Instead,
provide your employees with some extra security by using only paycards issued
by a bank, which carries FDIC insurance on funds deposited with it.

6-9 HOW DO | MAKE ELECTRONIC CHILD
SUPPORT PAYMENTS?

 

A larger company likely has been served with a large number of court orders,
requiring it to deduct child support payments from the pay of those employees who
have been unable or unwilling to make these payments on their own. Though most
states still allow these payments to be made by check, an increasing number are
requiring electronic payments. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
maintains a Web page at the following address that itemizes the child support payment
status for each state: http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cse/newhire/employer/
contacts/eftedi_statecontacts.htm.

Currently, California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, and Massachusetts require that
electronic payments be made, though the trigger point depends on either the size of the
business or the number of remittances that it makes each month. The use of electronic
payments is expanding, so rather than viewing this requirement as yet another
payment exception that will increase the amount of work in the payroll department,
consider attempting to install it for all states (except South Carolina, which does not


6-11 Should | Outsource Payroll? 153

yet accept electronic payments). By going fully electronic, it is much easier to make
automated, recurring support payments in a timely manner.

To learn more about the process of setting up recurring electronic child support
payments, the National Automated Clearing House Association has posted an
excellent “‘User Guide for Electronic Child Support Payments” online, which is
located at http://ecsp.nacha.org/resources.html. The guide provides an overview of
how these payments work and why they are required, as well as explaining exactly
how to set up the data contents of the Payment Order/Remittance Advice Transaction
Set (820) for an electronic data interchange payment.

6-10 HOW DO | AUTOMATE PAYROLL REMITTANCES?

 

Acompany may go toa great deal of trouble to install a direct deposit option in order to
avoid sending checks to employees, only to find that it must still send a remittance
advice, which lists the amounts paid and incidental data such as vacation or sick time
earned. Because a company must send its employees some evidence of payment, it is
difficult to avoid this distribution step.

If a company has outsourced its payroll processing, it is possible that the supplier
offers an Internet-based delivery solution, whereby it notifies employees by e-mail
that remittances are available on the supplier’s Web site. Employees then use a
password to access images of their remittances, which they can print as needed.

If a company processes its payroll in-house, then the solution is the same but
becomes more difficult to implement. The payroll system must compile a set of
electronic messages after each payroll run, which are then loaded into the company’s
e-mail system for distribution to employees. Further, the company must post the
remittance information on an intranet site, and do so with sufficient security to
reasonably ensure that personal information cannot be accessed by an unauthorized
person.

A variation on e-mail notifications is to post a schedule of remittance posting dates
in the employee manual, so that employees know when to access their accounts on
those dates to ascertain pay information. This eliminates the need for an e-mail
notification step.

6-11 SHOULD | OUTSOURCE PAYROLL?

 

A typical in-house payroll department has many concerns. Besides the task of issuing
paychecks, it may have to do so for many company locations, where tax rates differ,
employees are paid on different dates, and tax deposits must be made to state
governments by different means (e.g., direct deposit, bank deposit, or mail) and
W-2 forms must be issued to all employees at the beginning of each year. Of all these
issues, the one carrying the heaviest price for failure is a government tax deposit—
missing such a payment by a single day can carry a large penalty that rapidly


154 Management Accounting Best Practices

accumulates in size. All of these problems and costs can be avoided by handing over
some or all portions of the payroll function to an outside supplier. Here are additional
reasons for outsourcing payroll:

¢ Tax remittances. A supplier pays all payroll taxes without troubling the company.
The savings from avoiding government penalties for late tax payments will in
some cases pay for the cost of the payroll supplier!

¢ Multilocation processing. The supplier can usually process payroll for all
company locations; several suppliers are based in all major cities, so they can
handle paycheck deliveries to nearly any location. Other smaller suppliers get
around not having multiple locations by sending checks via overnight delivery
services—either approach works very well.

¢ Direct deposit. Suppliers can deposit payments directly into employee bank
accounts, which is something that many in-house payroll systems, especially the
smaller ones, are incapable of doing.

* Check stuffing. The time-consuming task of stuffing checks into envelopes is one
that many suppliers will handle, thereby freeing up the internal staff for less
mundane work.

¢ Reporting. Suppliers also provide a wide array of reports, usually including a
report-writing package that can address any special reporting needs. Once again,
many smaller in-house payroll systems lack a report-writing package, so this can
be a real benefit.

¢ New hire reporting. Most states require a company to report to them whenever a
new employee is hired, so they can determine if that person can be garnished for
some outstanding court claim. Suppliers sometimes provide this service for free,
since they can easily batch all new hires for all their customers and forward this
information electronically to the state governments.

¢ Expert staff: Suppliers are staffed with a large team of experts who know all
about the intricacies of the payroll process. They can answer payroll questions
over the phone, provide specialized or standard training classes, or come out to
company locations for hands-on consulting.

* Cost. A study commissioned by ADP and independently conducted by Price-
WaterhouseCoopers shows that the total cost of outsourcing can be 30 percent
less than the cost of having in-house payroll processing. The wide array of
benefits has convinced thousands of companies to switch to an outsourced payroll
solution.

¢ Backups. Though not usually considered a significant reason to outsource,
suppliers back up their payroll systems at least daily, so there is minimal risk
of lost payroll data.

* Other services. Some suppliers offer additional services, especially in the areas
of benefits administration, 401(k) plans, and unemployment compensation

management, that allow a company to outsource not only much of its payroll
work, but also a great deal of its human resources functions as well.

Suppliers offering some or all of the functionality just noted include ADP, Inc.;
Ceridian; Paychex, Inc.; and PayMaxx, Inc.

However, before jumping on the outsourcing bandwagon, consider a few reasons
for not using a payroll supplier. One is that outsourcing can be more expensive than an
in-house solution in some situations (despite the finding of the ADP study noted
above), because the supplier must spend funds to market its services as well as make a
profit—two items that an in-house payroll department does not include in its budget.
A supplier will usually sell its services to a company by offering an apparently
inexpensive deal with a small set of baseline services, and then charge high fees for
add-on services, such as direct deposit, check stuffing, early check deliveries, report-
writing software, and extra human resources functionality. As long as a company is
well aware of these extra fees and budgets them into its initial cost-benefit calcula-
tions, there should be no surprises later on, as more supplier services are added and
fees continue to mount.

The other main problem with outsourcing is that the payroll database cannot be
linked to a company’s other computer systems. Since its payroll data is usually located
in a mainframe computer at an off-site supplier location, it is difficult to create an
interface that will allow for electronic user access to payroll data. The best alternative
(though a poor one) is to either keypunch the most important data in a company
payroll database from payroll reports printed by the supplier or to download data from
the supplier’s computer. Because of this missing database linkage, a number of larger
companies prefer to keep their payroll-processing work in-house.

In short, there are many good reasons for a company to outsource its payroll
function to a qualified supplier. The only companies that should not do so are those
that are either highly sensitive to the cost of payroll processing or those that must link
their payroll data to other company databases.

6-12 CAN | OUTSOURCE EMPLOYMENT VERIFICATIONS?

 

Companies with a large number of employees will find that their payroll departments
are constantly burdened with employment verification requests for both current and
previous employees. This can be a considerable chore, and one that cannot wait, since
employees need these verifications in order to qualify for car loans, mortgages,
apartment leases, and so on.

A solution to this labor-intensive activity is to have a third party handle all
employment verifications with both automated voice response and Internet access.
The largest provider of this service is The Work Number, which is a service of the
TALX Corporation. Using this service, employers send employee information to The
Work Number’s central database in either flat file or XML format. Then, when an


156 Management Accounting Best Practices

outside party wants to verify employment information, they enter the employee’s
Social Security number and the 5-digit employer code (which is accessible on The
Work Number’s Web site at www.theworknumber.com). If they also want salary
information, then the employee must use his PIN number to create a Salary Key Code
(either through the Web site or over the phone), which is good for a one-time access of
his salary information.

If the outside party is a low-volume user of The Work Number, they will pay $13
for each employment verification and $16 for each salary verification, while a higher-
volume user will pay $11 and $14, respectively.

Fees to the employer are remarkably inexpensive. The Work Number charges the
employer $0.25 per active employee per year, as well as a fee of between $4 and $5 for
each social services verification.

The Work Number gives employers access to webManager, which is an online site
on which they can see metrics for verification information, including verifications by
the Web versus the phone, and for verifications of active versus inactive employee
records.

By taking this approach, employers can eliminate all employment verification
work, while also speeding up the verification process for their employees and ensuring
that the information provided is as accurate as possible.

6-13 CAN | OUTSOURCE BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION?

 

Though benefits are normally administered through a separate human resources
department, the payroll staff can become involved in two ways: first, the company is so
small that both functions are combined into the payroll department; second, the
payroll staff must handle benefit-related deductions and the disposition of the
deducted funds. The latter situation occurs in nearly all companies, since a growing
trend is to shift a greater proportion of benefit costs to employees through deductions.
If there are a large number of different benefit providers, this can result in more time
being spent on deduction tracking than on timekeeping!

Outsourcing benefits administration to the same company that provides a
company’s payroll services is an ideal way to improve the situation. For example,
by shifting 401(k) withholding to the payroll supplier, the payroll staff no longer
has to track the amount of 401(k) funds to transfer to the third-party plan
administrator, since this is now done automatically by the payroll supplier. The
same approach applies to flexible spending accounts (FSAs), which can be
administered by the payroll supplier. An added benefit here is that a company
can eliminate a bank account, which is usually kept separately to track withheld
FSA funds. Further, employees can usually manage changes to their benefit
packages online by accessing Web portals maintained by the payroll supplier,
thereby removing benefits data entry from the payroll staff’s list of responsibilities.
Payroll suppliers that provide benefits services include ADP, Inc.; Ceridian; and
PayMaxx, Inc.


6-14 How Many Payroll Cycles Should | Have? 157

Outsourcing benefits administration tends to be a better approach than acquiring
software that conducts the same functions. The reason is that one can pay for only
those aspects of a benefits outsourcing program that are most necessary, whereas
acquiring a commercial software program will result in the acquisition and payment
of ongoing maintenance on all the functionality of that software, which likely
contains a great deal more than is needed.

If there is a downside to the consolidation of many services with a single supplier,
it is the company’s dependence on that organization for a long period of time, since it
can be quite difficult (or at least inconvenient) to shift services away from a supplier
once they have been consolidated. Consequently, it is useful to closely examine the
payroll and benefits administration supplier’s financial status, local operations staff,
and operating procedures to ensure that there is a close fit that will likely result in a
comfortable long-term relationship.

6-14 HOW MANY PAYROLL CYCLES SHOULD | HAVE?

 

Many payroll departments are fully occupied with processing some kind of payroll
every week, and possibly even several times in one week. The latter situation occurs
when different groups of employees are paid for different time periods. For example,
hourly employees may be paid every week, while salaried employees may be paid
twice a month. Processing multiple payroll cycles eats up most of the free time of the
payroll staff, leaving it with little room for cleaning up paperwork or researching
improvements to its basic operations.

All of the various payroll cycles should be consolidated into a single, company-
wide payroll cycle. By doing so, the payroll staff no longer has to spend extra time on
additional payroll processing, nor does it have to worry about the different pay rules
that may apply to each processing period—instead, everyone is treated exactly the
same. To make payroll processing even more efficient, it is useful to lengthen the
payroll cycles. For example, a payroll department that processes weekly payrolls must
run the payroll 52 times a year, whereas one that processes monthly payrolls only does
so 12 times per year, which eliminates 75 percent of the processing that the first
department must handle. These changes represent an enormous reduction in the
payroll-processing time the payroll staff requires.

Any changes to the payroll cycles may be met with opposition by the orga-
nization’s employees. The primary complaint is that the employees have
structured their spending habits around the timing of the old pay system and
that any change will not give them enough cash to continue those habits. For
example, employees who currently receive a paycheck every week may have a
great deal of difficulty in adjusting their spending to a paycheck that arrives only
once a month. If a company were to switch from a short to a longer pay cycle, it
is extremely likely that the payroll staff will be deluged with requests for pay
advances well before the next paycheck is due for release, which will require a


158 Management Accounting Best Practices

large amount of payroll staff time to handle. To overcome this problem, consider
increasing pay cycles incrementally, perhaps to twice a month or once every two
weeks, and also tell employees that pay advances will be granted for a limited
transition period. By making these incremental changes, one can reduce the
associated amount of employee discontent.

Review the prospective change with the rest of the management team to make sure
that it is acceptable to them. They must buy into the need for the change, because their
employees will also be impacted by it, and they will receive complaints about it. This
best practice requires a long lead time to implement, as well as multiple notifications
to the staff about its timing and impact on them. It is also useful to go over the granting
of payroll advances with the payroll staff, so that they are prepared for the likely surge
in requests for advances.

6-15 HOW CAN | REDUCE THE NUMBER OF
EMPLOYEE PAYROLL-RELATED INQUIRIES?

 

Payroll departments spend a great deal of time answering employee questions
about their pay. According to some surveys, this involves at least one-third
of all department time! Though most of the questions are simple enough to
answer, when they are multiplied by the number of employees in the company it
is easy to see how the payroll staff can spend so much time just responding to
queries.

If the payroll staff could compile a list of the most commonly asked questions
by employees, it would not be an especially long list—perhaps just 10 or
20 questions for a basic payroll system, and maybe twice that amount if they
also handle benefits through the payroll system. Given the high proportion of
questions dealing with a limited number of issues, this is an ideal area in which
to create answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) and post them on a
company intranet site. Employees can then be directed to the FAQs list, and only
then asked to address the payroll staff regarding more complex questions. Sample
FAQs are as follows:

¢ If Iam on direct deposit, at what time of day on payday will my pay be
deposited in my checking account?
Answer: Your pay will be available in your checking account as of 8 A.M. on
payday.

¢ If payday falls on a weekend, when am I paid?
Answer: If payday falls on a weekend, you will be paid as of the first business day
prior to that weekend.

¢ Can I get an advance on my next paycheck?
Answer: No. The company policy is never to issue pay advances under any
circumstances.


6-15 How Can | Reduce the Number of Employee Payroll—Related Inquiries? 159

¢ If resign from the company, when will I be paid my final paycheck?
Answer: If you voluntarily leave the company, you will be paid as part of the next
regularly scheduled payroll.

¢ How much unused vacation time can I roll forward into next year?
Answer: You can roll 40 hours forward. For exceptional cases, you must apply to
your department manager for a waiver.

Though these FAQs can be also listed in the employee manual, employees do not
always refer to that document. By also presenting them on the intranet site (which
employee tend to access more frequently, especially if it is a rich, multifunction site),
there is a much greater chance that employees will access the FAQs instead of the
payroll staff.

Inventory Decisions

If a company has invested in inventory, the accountant faces a number of key
decisions. The issue of most immediate importance is how to gain assurance regarding
the accuracy of the inventory, so the inventory valuation can be included in the
financial statements. Another accounting concern, though one that is not so immedi-
ate, is how to develop a system for reliably locating and dealing with obsolete
inventory. This is needed to ensure that inventory is not incorrectly overvalued at year-
end, when it will presumably be audited. Once identified, the obsolete inventory must
be dispositioned in the most profitable manner possible. Along the same lines, the
accountant must set up a lower of cost or market procedure to ensure that inventory
items are not overvalued in relation to their current market value.

There are also several systems-related issues to consider. The accountant must
determine what type of inventory costing system to use, the controls needed to ensure
that costs are correctly recorded, and a set of measurements to monitor inventory
levels. Finally, the accountant may become involved in such inventory management
issues as the determination of inventory service levels, shifting inventory ownership to
suppliers, and the mitigation of price protection costs. This chapter provides answers
to all of these key questions. The following table itemizes the section number in which
the answers to each question can be found:

7-1 HOW DO I MANAGE INVENTORY ACCURACY?

 

A physical inventory count can be eliminated if accurate perpetual inventory records
are available. Many steps are required to implement such a system, requiring

160


7-1 How Do | Manage Inventory Accuracy? 161

considerable effort. The controller should evaluate a company’s resources prior to
embarking on this process to ensure that they are sufficient to set up and maintain this
system. This section contains a sequential listing of the steps that must be completed
before an accurate system is achieved. This is a difficult implementation to shortcut,
for missing any of the following steps will have an impact on the accuracy of the
completed system. If a company skips a few steps, it will likely not achieve the
requisite high levels of accuracy that it wants, and ends up having to backtrack and
complete those steps at a later date. Consequently, a company should sequentially
complete all of the following steps to implement a successful inventory tracking
system:

1. Select and install inventory tracking software. The primary requirements for this
software are:

° Track transactions. The software should list the frequency of product usage,
which allows the materials manager to determine what inventory quantities
should be changed, as well as to determine which items are obsolete.

° Update records immediately. The inventory data must always be up-to-date,
because production planners must know what is in stock, while cycle counters
require access to accurate data. Batch updating of the system is not acceptable.

° Report inventory records by location. Cycle counters need inventory records
that are sorted by location in order to more efficiently locate and count the
inventory.

2. Test inventory tracking software. Create a set of typical records in the new
software, and perform a series of transactions to ensure that the software
functions properly. In addition, create a large number of records and perform
the transactions again, to see if the response time of the system drops sig-
nificantly. If the software appears to function properly, continue to the next step.
Otherwise, fix the problems with the software supplier’s assistance, or acquire a
different software package.

3. Revise the rack layout. It is much easier to move racks prior to installing a
perpetual inventory system, because no inventory locations must be changed in
the computer system. Create aisles that are wide enough for forklift operation if
this is needed for larger storage items, and cluster small parts racks together for
easier parts picking. The services of a consultant are useful for arriving at the
optimum warehouse configuration.

4. Create rack locations. A typical rack location is, for example, A-01-B-01. This
means that this location code is located in Aisle A, Rack 1. Within Rack 1, it is
located on Level B (numbered from the bottom to the top). Within Level B, it is
located in Partition 1. Many companies skip the use of partitions, on the grounds
that an aisle-rack-level numbering system will get a stock picker to within a few
feet of an inventory item.

As one progresses down an aisle, the rack numbers should progress in
ascending sequence, with the odd rack numbers on the left and the even

numbers on the right. Thus, the first rack on the left side of aisle D is D-01,


162 Management Accounting Best Practices

the first rack on the right is D-02, the second rack on the left is D-03, and so on.
This layout allows a stock picker to move down the center of the aisle, efficiently
pulling items from stock based on sequential location codes.

5. Lock the warehouse. One of the main causes of record inaccuracy is removal
of items from the warehouse by outside staff. To stop this removal, all entrances
to the warehouse must be locked. Only warehouse personnel should be
allowed access to it. All other personnel entering the warehouse should be
accompanied by a member of the warehouse staff to prevent the removal of
inventory.

6. Consolidate parts. To reduce the labor of counting the same item in multiple
locations, group common parts into one place. This is not a one-shot process, for
it is difficult to combine parts when there are thousands of them scattered
throughout the warehouse. Expect to repeat this step at intervals, especially
when entering location codes in the computer, when it tells you that the part has
already been entered for a different location!

7. Assign part numbers. Have several experienced personnel verify all part
numbers. A mislabeled part is as useless as a missing part, since the computer
database will not show that it exists. Mislabeled parts also affect the inventory
cost; for example, a mislabeled engine is more expensive than the item
represented by its incorrect part number, which may identify it as (for example)
a spark plug.

8. Verify units of measure. Have several experienced people verify all units of
measure. Unless the software allows multiple units of measure to be used, the
entire organization must adhere to one unit of measure for each item. For
example, the warehouse may desire tape to be counted in rolls, but the
engineering department had rather create bills of materials with tape measured
in inches instead of fractions of rolls. If someone goes into the inventory
database to change the unit of measure to suit his or her needs, this will also alter
the extended cost of the inventory; for example, when 10 rolls of tape with an
extended cost of $10 is altered so that it becomes 10 inches of tape, the cost will
drop to a few pennies, even though there are still 10 rolls on the shelf.
Consequently, not only must the units of measure be accurate, but the file
that stores this information must be kept off limits.

9. Pack the parts. Pack parts into containers, seal the containers, and label
them with the part number, unit of measure, and total quantity stored inside.
Leave a few parts free for ready use. Open containers only when additional stock
is needed. This method allows cycle counters to rapidly verify inventory
balances.

10. Count items. Count items when there is no significant activity in the warehouse,
such as during a weekend. Elaborate cross-checking of the counts, as would be
done during a year-end physical inventory count, is not necessary. It is more
important to have the perpetual inventory system operational before the ware-
house activity increases again; any errors in the data will quickly be detected


11.

12.

13.

14.

How Do | Manage Inventory Accuracy? 163

during cycle counts and flushed out of the database. The initial counts must
include a review of the part number, location, and quantity.

Train the warehouse staff. The warehouse staff should receive software training
immediately before using the system, so that they do not forget how to operate
the software. Enter a set of test records into the software, and have the staff
simulate all common inventory transactions, such as receipts, picks, and cycle
count adjustments.

Enter data into the computer. Have an experienced data entry person input the
location, part number, and quantity into the computer. Once the data has been
input, another person should cross-check the entered data against the original
data for errors.

Quick-check the data. Scan the data for errors. If all part numbers have the same
number of digits, then look for items that are too long or too short. Review
location codes to see if inventory is stored in nonexistent racks. Look for units of
measure that do not match the part being described. For example, is it logical to
have a pint of steel in stock? Also, if item costs are available, print a list of
extended costs. Excessive costs typically point to incorrect units of measure. For
example, a cost of $1 per box of nails will become $500 in the inventory report if
nails are incorrectly listed as individual units. All of these steps help to spot the
most obvious inventory errors.

Initiate cycle counts. In brief, print out a portion of the inventory list, sorted by
location. Using this report, have the warehouse staff count blocks of the
inventory on a continuous basis. They should look for accurate part numbers,
units of measure, locations, and quantities. The counts should concentrate on
high-value or high-use items, though the entire stock should be reviewed
regularly. The most important part of this step is to examine why mistakes
occur. If a cycle counter finds an error, its cause must be investigated and then
corrected, so that the mistake will not occur again. It is also useful to
assign specific aisles to cycle counters, which tends to make them more familiar
with their assigned inventory and the problems causing specific transactional
errors.

The standard way to determine which inventory should be cycle counted is to
count the most expensive items the most frequently. Accountants recommend
this approach, because it ensures the accuracy of the most expensive items in
stock, which gives them some reasonable assurance that the inventory value they
record in the financial statements is approximately correct.

The problem with this approach is that the accuracy of low-cost items is
considered less important—even though the absence of those items could
potentially keep an order from shipping, which negatively impacts revenue.

The solution is to base cycle counts on the frequency of item usage, which
means that an item that is used continually is counted the most frequently. This
approach still satisfies accountants, because a high-cost item that does not move
much will still be accurate with just a few counts per year, since very little can


164 Management Accounting Best Practices

possibly happen to it if it just sits on a shelf. Conversely, an item that is
constantly cycling in and out of the warehouse will be counted a great deal,
which will hopefully ensure a high level of accuracy and therefore assist in
avoiding stockouts that could halt shipments.

Creating a cycle count sample under a frequency-of-usage approach will
require a custom report from a materials planning system. To do so, accumulate
the number of putaways and picks per stock keeping unit on a rolling basis over
the past few months (possibly up to a year, if inventory turnover levels are low),
and then create a report that is sorted in declining order by volume of total
putaways and picks. This report can be used to manually select higher-frequency
items for more frequent counts.

However, this approach also requires recordkeeping to ensure that high-
frequency items are indeed counted more regularly than low-frequency items.
An alternative is to rearrange inventory so that higher-frequency items are stored
in specific aisle areas, for which an average usage frequency is calculated; then
count every item in each aisle area during a single count, and track the frequency
of cycle counts for the entire block of inventory. This results in much less
recordkeeping.

15. Initiate inventory audits. The inventory should be audited frequently, perhaps as
much as once a week. This allows the accountant to track changes in the
inventory accuracy level and initiate changes if the accuracy drops below
acceptable levels. In addition, frequent audits are an indirect means of telling
the staff that inventory accuracy is important, and must be maintained. The
minimum acceptable accuracy level is 95 percent, with an error being a mistaken
part number, unit of measure, quantity, or location. This accuracy level is needed
to ensure accurate inventory costing, as well as to assist the materials department
in planning future inventory purchases. In addition, establish a tolerance level
when calculating the inventory accuracy. For example, if the computer record of
a box of screws yields a quantity of 100 and the actual count results in 105
screws, then the record is accurate if the tolerance is at least 5 percent, but
inaccurate if the tolerance is reduced to 1 percent. The maximum allowable
tolerance should be no higher than 5 percent, with tighter tolerances being used
for high-value or high-use items.

16. Post results. Inventory accuracy is a team project, and the warehouse staff feels
more involved if the audit results are posted against the results of previous
audits. Accuracy percentages should be broken out for the counting area
assigned to each cycle counter, so that everyone can see who is doing the
best job of reviewing and correcting inventory counts.

17. Reward the staff. Accurate inventories save a company thousands of dollars in
many ways. This makes it cost-effective to encourage the staff to maintain and
improve the accuracy level with periodic bonuses that are based on the
attainment of higher levels of accuracy with tighter tolerances. Using rewards
results in a significant improvement in inventory record accuracy.


7-2 How Do | Identify Obsolete Inventory? 165

The long list of requirements to fulfill before achieving an accurate perpetual
inventory system makes it clear that this is not a project that yields immediate
results. Unless the inventory is very small or the conversion project is heavily
staffed, it is likely that a company faces many months of work before it arrives at the
nirvana of an extremely accurate inventory. Consequently, one should set expecta-
tions with management that project completion is a considerable way down the road,
and that only by making a major investment of time and resources will it be
completed.

Despite the major effort needed to implement this system, it is still absolutely
necessary as the first step in creating a closing process where there is no need to spend
days determining the proper inventory valuation.

7-2 HOW DO | IDENTIFY OBSOLETE INVENTORY?

 

The materials review board (MRB) is responsible for evaluating all obsolete
inventory, and determining the most appropriate disposition for each item. The
MRB is composed of representatives from every department having any interaction
with inventory issues: accounting, engineering, logistics, and production. For exam-
ple, the engineering staff may need to retain some items that they are planning to
incorporate into a new design, while the logistics staff may know that it is impossible
to obtain a rare part, and so prefer to hold onto the few items left in stock for service
parts use.

The simplest long-term way to find obsolete inventory without the assistance of
a computer system is to leave the physical inventory count tags on all inventory
items following completion of the annual physical count. The tags taped to any
items used during the subsequent year will be thrown away at the time of use,
leaving only the oldest unused items still tagged by the end of the year. One can then
tour the warehouse and discuss with the MRB each of these items to see if an
obsolescence reserve should be created for them. However, tags can fall off or be
ripped off inventory items, especially if there is a high level of traffic in nearby bins.
Though extra taping will reduce this issue, it is likely that some tag loss will occur
over time.

Even arudimentary computerized inventory tracking system is likely to record the
last date on which a specific part number was removed from the warehouse for
production or sale. If so, it is an easy matter to use a report writer to extract and sort this
information, resulting in a report listing all inventory, starting with those products
with the oldest “‘last used” date. By sorting the report with the oldest last usage date
listed first, one can readily arrive at a sort list of items requiring further investigation
for potential obsolescence. However, this approach does not yield sufficient proof that
an item will never be used again, since it may be an essential component of an item that
has not been scheduled for production in some time, or a service part for which
demand is low.

A more advanced version of the “last used” report is shown in Exhibit 7.1. It
compares total inventory withdrawals against the amount on hand, which by itself
may be sufficient information to conduct an obsolescence review. It also lists
planned usage, which calls for information from a material requirements plan-
ning system, and which informs one of any upcoming requirements that might
keep the MRB from otherwise disposing of an inventory item. An extended cost
for each item is also listed, in order to give report users some idea of the write-
off that might occur if an item is declared obsolete. In the exhibit, the subwoofer,
speaker bracket, and wall bracket appear to be obsolete based on prior usage,
but the planned use of more wall brackets would keep that item from being
disposed of.

Ifa computer system includes a bill of materials, there is a strong likelihood that it
also generates a “where used”’ report, listing all the bills of materials for which an
inventory item is used. If there is no “‘where used” listed on the report for an item, it is
likely that a part is no longer needed. This report is most effective if bills of materials
are removed from the computer system or deactivated as soon as products are
withdrawn from the market; this more clearly reveals those inventory items that
are no longer needed.

An additional approach for determining whether a part is obsolete is reviewing
engineering change orders. These documents show those parts being replaced by
different ones, as well as when the changeover is scheduled to take place. One can then
search the inventory database to see how many of the parts being replaced are still in
stock, which can then be totaled, yielding another variation on the amount of obsolete
inventory on hand.

A final source of information is the preceding period’s obsolete inventory report.
Even the best MRB will sometimes fail to dispose of acknowledged obsolete items.
The accounting staff should keep track of these items and continue to notify
management of those for which there is no disposition activity.


7-3 How Do | Dispose of Obsolete Inventory? 167

7-3 HOW DO | DISPOSE OF OBSOLETE INVENTORY?

 

This section outlines a number of disposition possibilities, beginning with full-price
sales and moving down through options having progressively lower returns.

In some situations, one can recover nearly the entire cost of excess items by asking
the service department to sell them to existing customers as replacement parts. This
approach is especially useful when the excess items are for specialized parts that
customers are unlikely to obtain elsewhere, since these sales can be presented to
customers as valuable replacements that may not be available for much longer.
Conversely, this approach is least useful for commodity items or those subject to rapid
obsolescence or having a short shelf life.

It is possible that some parts should be kept on hand for a number of years, to be
sold or given away as warranty replacements. This will reduce the amount of
obsolescence expense, and also keeps the company from having to procure or
remanufacture parts at a later date in order to meet service/repair obligations. The
amount of inventory to be held in this service/repair category can be roughly
calculated based on the company’s experience with similar products, or with the
current product if it has been sold for a sufficiently long period. Any additional
inventory on hand exceeding the total amount of anticipated service/repair parts can
then be disposed of. Of particular interest is the time period over which management
anticipates storing parts in the service/repair category. There should be some period
over which the company has historically found that there is some requirement for
parts, such as 5 or 10 years. Once this predetermined period has ended, a flag in the
product master file should trigger a message indicating that the remaining parts can be
eliminated. Prior to doing so, management should review recent transactional
experience to see if the service/repair period should be extended, or if it is now
safe to eliminate the remaining stock.

Another possibility is to return the goods to the original supplier. Doing so will
likely result in a restocking fee of 15 to 20 percent, which is still a bargain for
otherwise useless goods. Rather than buying back parts for cash, many suppliers will
only issue a credit against future purchases. This option becomes less likely if the
company has owned the goods for a very long time, since the supplier may no longer
have a need for them or no longer stocks them at all. Of course, this approach fails if
the supplier will only issue a credit and the company has no need for other parts sold by
the supplier.

Some types of inventory are categorized by suppliers as non-cancelable and non-
returnable (NCNR), usually because the inventory is so customized that they cannot
expect to resell it elsewhere. If so, the goods will be difficult to disposition, so it is best
to install a variety of up-front procedures to ensure that less NCNR inventory is
ordered or left unused by the company, thereby reducing the amount of future write-
offs. Here are some options to consider:

¢ Designate a field in the inventory item master file as the NCNR flag, and use it to
designate which inventory items are categorized as NCNR by suppliers.


168 Management Accounting Best Practices

¢ Using the NCNR flag, modify the corporate material requirements planning
system to forward all automatically generated purchase orders for these items to
the materials planning staff, who verifies that they are really needed.

¢ Use the NCNR flag to create reports showing any NCNR inventory that will no
longer be usable when an engineering change order is activated, when a bill of
materials is modified for some other reason, or when a customer cancels a sales order.

¢ Use the NCNR flag to report on any scheduled production requiring NCNR items
that is based on a forecast, rather than actual demand. When management realize
the extra risk associated with this type of inventory, they tend to reduce the size of
their forecasts.

¢ Finally, the NCNR status of inventory will be altered by suppliers from time to
time, so be sure to update the NCNR flags in the item master file at least once a year.

It may be possible to sell goods online through an auction service. Though the
best-known is eBay, there are other sites designed exclusively for the disposition of
excess goods, such as www.salvagesale.com. These sites are more proactive in
maintaining contact with potential buyers within specific commodity categories,
and so can sometimes generate higher resale prices.

A poor way to sell off excess inventory to salvage contractors is to allow them to
pick over the items for sale, only selecting those items they are certain to make a profit
on. By doing so, the bulk of the excess inventory will still be parked in the warehouse
when the contractors are gone. Instead, divide the inventory into batches, each one
containing some items of value, which a salvage contractor must purchase in total in
order to obtain that subset of items he really wants. Then have the contractors bid on
each batch. Though the total amount of funds realized may not be much higher than
would have been the case if the contractors had cherry-picked the inventory, they will
take on the burden of removing the inventory from the warehouse, thereby allowing
the company to avoid disposal expenses.

There are some instances where a company can donate excess inventory to a
charity. By doing so, it can claim a tax deduction for the book value of the donated
items. This will not generate any cash flow if the company has no reportable income,
though the deduction can contribute to a net operating loss carryforward that can be
carried into a different tax reporting year. If this approach looks viable, request a copy
of nonprofit status from the receiving entity, proving that it has been granted nonprofit
status under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Service tax code.

One of the major channels for inventory donations is the National Association for
the Exchange of Industrial Resources (www.naeir.org), which accepts new items from
donors and distributes them to nonprofits and schools. Here is how the process works:

1. Create a list of items to donate, with a description, quantity, and retail value.

2. Fax the list to NAEIR at 309-343-0862.

3. NAEIR will send back an acceptance letter if they can use the inventory. If they
cannot use it, do not ship it.


7-4 How Do | Set Up a Lower of Cost or Market System? 169

4. Ship the accepted items to NAEIR (the sender pays the freight).

5. NAEIR issues documentation needed for a tax claim. For tax purposes, a donating
company can deduct its cost, plus half the difference between its cost and the fair
market value, with a maximum deduction of twice its cost.

On the other end of the transaction, nonprofits and schools pay a $595 annual fee to
NAEIR. In exchange, they receive a catalog of what NAEIR has in stock five times a
year. NAEIR allocates inventory from each catalog on a weekly basis, over a 10-week
period (after which they issue a new catalog). They do this so that their stocks of high-
demand items are not taken as soon as each new catalog is issued. Each member can
request items from the catalog, but there is no assurance that there will be enough
inventory to go around.

Because NAEIR accepts only certain types of inventory that its members need, this
is not a catchall avenue for the disposition of inventory, and so should be considered
only one of a variety of inventory disposition options.

Finally, even if there is no hope of obtaining any form of compensation for
obsolete goods, strongly consider throwing them in the dumpster. By doing so, there
will be more storage space in the warehouse, allowing one to allocate the space to
other uses. Further, the amount of inventory insurance coverage will be less, resulting
in a smaller annual insurance premium. Depending on the local tax jurisdiction, one
can also avoid paying a property tax on the inventory that has been disposed of.
Further, one can also reduce the number of inventory items to track in the warehouse
database, which can lead to a reduction in the number of cycle-counting hours
required per day to review the entire inventory on a recurring basis.

7-4 HOW DO I SET UP A LOWER OF COST OR
MARKET SYSTEM?

 

The lower of cost or market (LCM) rule states that the cost of inventory cannot be
recorded higher than its replacement cost on the open market; the replacement cost is
bounded at the high end by its eventual selling price, less costs of disposal, nor can it
be recorded lower than that price, less a normal profit percentage. The concept is best
demonstrated with the four scenarios listed in the following example:

 

 

Completion/ — Upper Lower Existing
Selling Selling Price Normal Price Inventory Replacement Market
Item Price — Cost = Boundary— Profit = Boundary Cost Cost (1) Value (2) LCM
A $ 15.00 $ 4.00 $11.00 $2.20 $8.80 $ 8.00 $ 12.50 $11.00 $8.00
B 40.15 6.00 34.15 5.75 28.40 35.00 34.50 34.15 34.15
Cc 20.00 6.50 13.50 3.00 10.50 17.00 12.00 12.00 12.00
D 10.50 2.35 8.15 2.25 5.90 8.00 5.25 5.90 5.90

(1) The cost at which an inventory item could be purchased on the open market.
(2) Replacement cost, bracketed by the upper and lower price boundaries.

 


170 Management Accounting Best Practices

In the example, the numbers in the first six columns are used to derive the upper
and lower boundaries of the market values that will be used for the lower of cost or
market calculation. By subtracting the completion and selling costs from each
product’s selling price, we establish the upper price boundary (in bold) of the market
cost calculation. By then subtracting the normal profit from the upper cost boundary of
each product, we establish the lower price boundary. Using this information, the LCM
calculation for each of the listed products is as follows:

¢ Product A, replacement cost higher than existing inventory cost. The market
price cannot be higher than the upper boundary of $11.00, which is still higher
than the existing inventory cost of $8.00. Thus, the LCM is the same as the
existing inventory cost.

¢ Product B, replacement cost lower than existing inventory cost, but higher than
upper price boundary. The replacement cost of $34.50 exceeds the upper price
boundary of $34.15, so the market value is designated at $34.15. This is lower
than the existing inventory cost, so the LCM becomes $34.15.

¢ Product C, replacement cost lower than existing inventory cost, and within price
boundaries. The replacement cost of $12.00 is within the upper and lower price
boundaries, and so is used as the market value. This is lower than the existing
inventory cost of $17.00, so the LCM becomes $12.00.

¢ Product D, replacement cost lower than existing inventory cost, but lower than
lower price boundary. The replacement cost of $5.25 is below the lower price
boundary of $5.90, so the market value is designated as $5.90. This is lower than
the existing inventory cost of $8.00, so the LCM becomes $5.90.

The lower of cost or market calculation is likely to be conducted at such infrequent
intervals that the inventory accountant forgets how the calculation was made in the
past. Thus, there is a considerable risk that the calculations will be conducted
differently each time, yielding inconsistent results. To avoid this problem, consider
including in the accounting procedures manual a clear definition of the calculation to
be followed. A sample procedure is shown in Exhibit 7.2.

7-5 WHICH INVENTORY COSTING SYSTEM
SHOULD | USE?

 

There is no single inventory costing system that will work perfectly for every
company, so this section presents the essentials of a number of costing
systems, from which the reader can choose the most appropriate system. When
making a selection, a guiding principle is that the costing system used should be as
simple to calculate and easy to maintain as possible. The costing systems are as
follows:


7-5 Which Inventory Costing System Should | Use? 171

 

Exhibit 7.2 Lower of Cost or Market Procedure:

 

Use this procedure to periodically adjust the inventory valuation for those items whose
market value has dropped below their recorded cost.

1. Export the extended inventory valuation report to an electronic spreadsheet. Sort
it by declining extended dollar cost, and delete the 80% of inventory items
that do not comprise the top 20% of inventory valuation. Sort the remaining 20%
of inventory items by either part number or item description. Print the report.

2. Send a copy of the report to the materials manager, with instructions to compare
unit costs for each item on the list to market prices, and be sure to mutually
agree upon a due date for completion of the review.

3. When the materials management staff has completed its review, meet with the
materials manager to go over its results and discuss any major adjustments.
Have the materials management staff write down the valuation of selected items in
the inventory database whose cost exceeds their market value.

4. Have the accounting staff expense the value of the write-down in the accounting
records.

5. Write a memo detailing the results of the lower of cost or market calculation.
Attach one copy to the journal entry used to write down the valuation, and issue
another copy to the materials manager.

 

 

 

THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) METHOD

A computer manufacturer knows that the component parts it purchases are subject to
extremely rapid rates of obsolescence, sometimes rendering a part worthless in a
month or two. Accordingly, it will be sure to use up the oldest items in stock first,
rather than running the risk of scrapping them a short way into the future. For this type
of environment, the first-in first-out (FIFO) method is the ideal way to deal with the
flow of costs. This method assumes that the oldest parts in stock are always used first,
which means that their associated old costs are used first, as well.

The concept is best illustrated with an example, which we show in Exhibit 7.3. In
the first row, we create a single layer of inventory that results in 50 units of inventory, at
a per-unit cost of $10.00. So far, the extended cost of the inventory is the same as we
saw under the LIFO, but that will change as we proceed to the second row of data. In
this row, we have monthly inventory usage of 350 units, which FIFO assumes will use
the entire stock of 50 inventory units that were left over at the end of the preceding
month, as well as 300 units that were purchased in the current month. This wipes out
the first layer of inventory, leaving us with a single new layer that is composed of 700
units at a cost of $9.58 per unit. In the third row, there is 400 units of usage, which
again comes from the first inventory layer, shrinking it down to just 300 units.
However, since extra stock was purchased in the same period, we now have an extra
inventory layer that is comprised of 250 units, at a cost of $10.65 per unit. The rest of
the exhibit proceeds using the same FIFO layering assumptions.


172 Management Accounting Best Practices

There are several factors to consider before implementing a FIFO costing system.
They are as follows:

¢ Fewer inventory layers. The FIFO system generally results in fewer layers of
inventory costs in the inventory database than would a last-in, first-out (LIFO)
system, because a LIFO system will leave some layers of costs completely
untouched for long time periods if inventory levels do not drop, whereas a FIFO
system will continually clear out old layers of costs, so that multiple costing
layers do not have a chance to accumulate.

¢ Reduces taxes payable in periods of declining costs. Though it is very unusual to
see declining inventory costs, it sometimes occurs in industries where there is
either ferocious price competition among suppliers, or else extremely high rates
of innovation that in turn lead to cost reductions. In such cases, using the
earliest costs first will result in the immediate recognition of the highest
possible expense, which reduces the reported profit level and therefore reduces
taxes payable.

¢ Shows higher profits in periods of rising costs. Since it charges off the earliest
costs first, any very recent increase in costs will be stored in inventory, rather than
being immediately recognized. This will result in higher levels of reported profits,
though the attendant income tax liability will also be higher.

¢ Less risk of outdated costs in inventory. Because old costs are used first in a
FIFO system, there is no way for old and outdated costs to accumulate
in inventory. This prevents the management group from having to worry
about the adverse impact of inventory reductions on reported levels of profit,
either with excessively high or low charges to the cost of goods sold. This
avoids the dilemma noted earlier for LIFO, where just-in-time systems may
not be implemented if the result will be a dramatically different cost of goods
sold.

In short, the FIFO cost layering system tends to result in the storage of the most
recently incurred costs in inventory and higher levels of reported profits. It is most
useful for those companies whose main concern is reporting high profits rather
reducing income taxes.

THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD

In a supermarket, the shelves are stocked several rows deep with products. A
shopper will walk by and pick products from the front row. If the stocking person
is lazy, he will then add products to the front row locations from which products were
just taken, rather than shifting the oldest products to the front row and putting new ones
in the back. This concept of always taking the newest products first is called last-in first-
out (LIFO). The following factors must be considered before implementing a LIFO
system:

174 Management Accounting Best Practices

¢ Many layers. The LIFO cost flow approach can result in a large number of
inventory layers. Though this is not important when a computerized accounting
system is used that will automatically track a large number of such layers, it can
be burdensome if the cost layers are manually tracked.

¢ Alters the inventory valuation. If there are significant changes in product costs
over time, the earliest inventory layers may contain costs that are wildly different
from market conditions in the current period, which could result in the recogni-
tion of unusually high or low costs if these cost layers are ever accessed. Also,
LIFO costs can never be reduced to the lower of cost or market, thereby
perpetuating any unusually high inventory values in the various inventory layers.

¢ Interferes with the implementation of just-in-time systems. As noted in the
previous bullet point, clearing out the final cost layers of a LIFO system can
result in unusual cost of goods sold figures. If these results will cause a significant
skewing of reported profitability, company management may be put in the
unusual position of opposing the implementation of advanced manufacturing
concepts, such as just-in-time, that reduce or eliminate inventory levels.

¢ Reduces taxes payable in periods of rising costs. In an inflationary environment,
costs that are charged off to the cost of goods sold as soon as they are incurred will
result in a higher cost of goods sold and a lower level of profitability, which in turn
results in a lower tax liability. This is the principle reason why LIFO is used by
most companies.

¢ Requires consistent usage for all reporting. Under IRS rules, if a company uses
LIFO to value its inventory for tax reporting purposes, then it must do the same for its
external financial reports. The result of this rule is that acompany cannot report lower
earnings for tax purposes and higher earnings for all other purposes by using an
alternative inventory valuation method. However, it is still possible to mention what
profits would have been if some other method had been used, but only in the form of a
footnote appended to the financial statements. If financial reports are generated only
for internal management consumption, then any valuation method may be used.

In short, LIFO is used primarily for reducing a company’s income tax liability.
This single focus can cause problems, such as too many cost layers, an excessively low
inventory valuation, and a fear of inventory reductions due to the recognition of
inventory cost layers that may contain very low per-unit costs, which will result in
high levels of recognized profit and therefore a higher tax liability. Given these issues,
one should carefully consider the utility of tax avoidance before implementing a LIFO
cost layering system.

As an example, The Magic Pen Company has made 10 purchases, which are
itemized in Exhibit 7.4. In the exhibit, the company has purchased 500 units of a
product with part number BK0043 on May 3, 2007 (as noted in the first row of
data), and uses 450 units during that month, leaving the company with 50 units.
These 50 units were all purchased at a cost of $10.00 each, so they are itemized in
Column 6 as the first layer of inventory costs for this product. In the next row of

data, an additional 1,000 units were bought on June 4, 2007, of which only 350
units were used. This leaves an additional 650 units at a purchase price of $9.58,
which are placed in the second inventory layer, as noted on Column 7. In the third
row, there is a net decrease in the amount of inventory, so this reduction comes out
of the second (or last) inventory layer in Column 7; the earliest layer, as described
in Column 6, remains untouched, since it was the first layer of costs added, and will
not be used until all other inventory has been eliminated. The exhibit continues
through seven more transactions, at one point increasing to four layers of inventory
costs.

THE DOLLAR VALUE LIFO METHOD

This method computes a conversion price index for the year-end inventory in
comparison to the base year cost. This index is computed separately for each company
business unit. The conversion price index can be computed with the double-extension
method. Under this approach, the total extended cost of the inventory at both base year
prices and the most recent prices are calculated. Then the total inventory cost at the
most recent prices is divided by the total inventory cost at base year prices, resulting in
a conversion price percentage, or index. The index represents the change in overall
prices between the current year and the base year. This index must be computed and
retained for each year in which the LIFO method is used.

There are two problems with the double-extension method. First, it requires a
massive volume of calculations if there are many items in inventory. Second, tax
regulations require that any new item added to inventory, no matter how many years
after the establishment of the base year, have a base year cost included in the LIFO
database for purposes of calculating the index. This base year cost is supposed to be
the one in existence at the time of the base year, which may require considerable
research to determine or estimate. Only if it is impossible to determine a base year cost
can the current cost of a new inventory item be used as the base year cost. For these
reasons, the double-extension inventory valuation method is not recommended in
most cases.

As an example, a company carries a single item of inventory in stock. It has
retained the following year-end information about the item for the past four years:

 

 

Ending Extended at
Ending Unit Current Current Year-end
Year Quantity Price Price
1 3,500 $32.00 $112,000
2 7,000 34.50 241,500
3 5,500 36.00 198,000
4 7,250 37.50 271,875

 

The first year is the base year upon which the double-extension index will be based
in later years. In the second year, we extend the total year-end inventory by both the


7-5 Which Inventory Costing System Should | Use? 177

base year price and the current year price, as follows:

 

 

Extended Ending Extended

Year-end Base Year at Base Current at Ending
Quantity Cost Year Cost Price Current Price

7,000 $32.00 $224,000 $34.50 $241,500

 

To arrive at the index between year 2 and the base year, we divide the extended
ending current price of $241,500 by the extended base year cost of $224,000, yielding
an index of 107.8 percent.

The next step is to calculate the incremental amount of inventory added in year 2,
determine its cost using base year prices, and then multiply this extended amount by
our index of 107.8 percent to arrive at the cost of the incremental year two LIFO layer.
The incremental amount of inventory added is the year-end quantity of 7,000 units,
less the beginning balance of 3,500 units, which is 3,500 units. When multiplied by the
base year cost of $32.00, we arrive at an incremental increase in inventory of
$112,000. Finally, we multiply the $112,000 by the price index of 107.8 percent
to determine that the cost of the year 2 LIFO layer is $120,736.

Thus, at the end of year 2, the total double-extension LIFO inventory valuation is
the base year valuation of $112,000 plus the year-2 layer’s valuation of $120,736,
totaling $232,736.

In year 3, the amount of ending inventory has declined from the previous year, so
no new layering calculation is required. Instead, we assume that the entire reduction of
1,500 units during that year were taken from the year-2 inventory layer. To calculate
the amount of this reduction, we multiply the remaining amount of the year-2 layer
(5,500 units less the base year amount of 3,500 units, or 2,000 units) times the ending
base year price of $32.00 and the year-2 index of 107.8 percent. This calculation
results in a new year-2 layer of $68,992.

Thus, at the end of year 3, the total double-extension LIFO inventory valuation is
the base layer of $112,000 plus the reduced year-2 layer of $68,992, totaling $180,992.

In year 4, there is an increase in inventory, so we can calculate the presence of a
new layer using the following table:

 

 

Extended Ending Extended

Year-end Base Year at Base Current at Ending
Quantity Cost Year Cost Price Current Price

7,250 $32.00 $232,000 $37.50 $271,875

 

Again, we divide the extended ending current price of $271,875 by the
extended base year cost of $232,000, yielding an index of 117.2 percent. To
complete the calculation, we then multiply the incremental increase in inventory
over year 3 of 1,750 units, multiply it by the base year cost of $32.00/unit, and then


178 Management Accounting Best Practices

multiply the result by our new index of 117.2 percent to arrive at a year-4 LIFO
layer of $65,632.

Thus, after four years of inventory layering calculations, the double-extension
LIFO valuation consists of the following three layers:

 

 

Layer Type Layer Valuation Layer Index
Base layer $112,000 0.0%
Year 2 layer 68,992 107.8%
Year 4 layer 65,632 117.2%
Total $246,624 _—

 

THE LINK CHAIN METHOD

Another way to calculate the dollar-value LIFO inventory is to use the link-chain
method. This approach is designed to avoid the problem encountered during double-
extension calculations, where one must determine the base year cost of each new item
added to inventory. However, tax regulations require that the link-chain method be
used for tax reporting purposes only if it can be clearly demonstrated that all other
dollar-value LIFO calculation methods are not applicable due to high rates of churn in
the types of items included in inventory.

The link-chain method creates inventory layers by comparing year-end prices to
prices at the beginning of each year, thereby avoiding the problems associated with
comparisons to a base year that may be many years in the past. This results in a rolling
cumulative index that is linked (hence the name) to the index derived in the preceding
year. Tax regulations allow one to create the index using a representative sample of the
total inventory valuation that must comprise at least one-half of the total inventory
valuation. In brief, a link-chain calculation is derived by extending the cost of
inventory at both beginning-of-year and end-of-year prices to arrive at a pricing index
within the current year; this index is then multiplied by the ongoing cumulative index
from the previous year to arrive at a new cumulative index that is used to price out the
new inventory layer for the most recent year.

The following example of the link-chain method assumes the same inventory
information just used for the double-extension example. However, we have also noted
the beginning inventory cost for each year and included the extended beginning
inventory cost for each year, which facilitates calculations under the link-chain
method:

 

 

Ending Beginning End of Extended Extended

Unit of Year Year at Beginning at End of

Year Quantity Cost/Each Cost/Each of Year Price Year Price
1 3,500 $— $32.00 $— $112,000

2 7,000 32.00 34.50 224,000 241,500
3 5,500 34.50 36.00 189,750 198,000
4 7,250 36.00 37.50 261,000 271,875

 


7-5 Which Inventory Costing System Should | Use? 179

As was the case for the double-extension method, there is no index for year 1,
which is the base year. In year 2, the index will be the extended year-end price of
$241,500 divided by the extended beginning-of-year price of $224,000, or 107.8
percent. This is the same percentage calculated for year 2 under the double-extension
method, because the beginning-of-year price is the same as the base price used under
the double-extension method.

We then determine the value of the year-2 inventory layer by first dividing the
extended year-end price of $241,500 by the cumulative index of 107.8 percent to
arrive at an inventory valuation restated to the base year cost of $224,026. We then
subtract the year-1 base layer of $112,000 from the $224,026 to arrive at a new layer at
the base year cost of $112,026, which we then multiply by the cumulative index of
107.8 percent to bring it back to current year prices. This results in a year-2 inventory
layer of $120,764. At this point, the inventory layers are as follows:

 

 

Base Year LIFO Layer Cumulative
Layer Type Valuation Valuation Index
Base layer $112,000 $112,000 0.0%
Year 2 layer 112,026 120,764 107.8%
Total $224,026 $232,764 _—

 

In year 3, the index will be the extended year-end price of $198,000 divided by the
extended beginning-of-year price of $189,750, or 104.3 percent. Since this is the first
year in which the base year was not used to compile beginning-of-year costs, we must
first derive the cumulative index, which is calculated by multiplying the preceding
year’s cumulative index of 107.8 percent by the new year-3 index of 104.3 percent,
resulting in a new cumulative index of 112.4 percent. By dividing year 3’s extended
year-end inventory of $198,000 by this cumulative index, we arrive at inventory
priced at base year costs of $176,157.

This is less than the amount recorded in year 2, so there will be no inventory layer.
Instead, we must reduce the inventory layer recorded for year 2. To do so, we subtract
the base year layer of $112,000 from the $176,157 to arrive at a reduced year-2 layer of
$64,157 at base year costs. We then multiply the $64,157 by the cumulative index in
year 2 of 107.8 percent to arrive at a inventory valuation for the year-2 layer of
$69,161. At this point, the inventory layers and associated cumulative indexes are as
follows:

 

 

Base Year LIFO Layer Cumulative
Layer Type Valuation Valuation Index
Base layer $112,000 $112,000 0.0%
Year 2 layer 64,157 69,161 107.8%
Year 3 layer _ —_— 112.4%

Total $176,157 $181,161 _

 


180 Management Accounting Best Practices

In year 4, the index will be the extended year-end price of $271,875 divided by the
extended beginning-of-year price of $261,000, or 104.2 percent. We then derive the new
cumulative index by multiplying the preceding year’s cumulative index of 112.4 percent
by the year-4 index of 104.2 percent, resulting in a new cumulative index of 117.1
percent. By dividing year 4’s extended year-end inventory of $271,875 by this
cumulative index, we arrive at inventory priced at base year costs of $232,173. We
then subtract the preexisting base year inventory valuation for all previous layers of
$176,157 from this amount to arrive at the base year valuation of the year-4 inventory
layer, which is $56,016. Finally, we multiply the $56,016 by the cumulative index
in year 4 of 117.1 percent to arrive at an inventory valuation for the year-4 layer of
$62,575. At this point, the inventory layers and associated cumulative indexes are as
follows:

 

 

 

Base Year LIFO Layer Cumulative
Layer Type Valuation Valuation Index
Base layer $112,000 $112,000 0.0%
Year 2 layer 64,157 69,161 107.8%
Year 3 layer _ 112.4%
Year 4 layer 56,016 62,575 117.1%
Total $232,173 $243,736 —

 

Compare the results of this calculation with those from the double-extension
method. The indexes are nearly identical, as are the final LIFO layer valuations. The
primary differences between the two methods is the avoidance of a base year cost
determination for any new items subsequently added to inventory, for which a current
cost is used instead.

THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE METHOD

The weighted-average costing method is calculated exactly in accordance with its
name—it is a weighted average of the costs in inventory. It has the singular advantage
of not requiring a database that itemizes the many potential layers of inventory at the
different costs at which they were acquired. Instead, the weighted average of all units
in stock is determined, at which point all of the units in stock are accorded that
weighted-average value. When parts are used from stock, they are all issued at the
same weighted-average cost. If new units are added to stock, then the costs of the
additions are added to the weighted average of all existing items in stock, which will
result in a new, slightly modified weighted average for all of the parts in inventory
(both the old and new ones).

This system has no particular advantage in relation to income taxes, since it does
not skew the recognition of income based on trends in either increasing or declining
costs. This makes it a good choice for those organizations that do not want to deal with
tax planning. It is also useful for very small inventory valuations, where there would
not be any significant change in the reported level of income even if the LIFO or FIFO
methods were to be used.


7-5 Which Inventory Costing System Should | Use? 181

Exhibit 7.5 illustrates the weighted-average calculation for inventory valuations,
using a series of 10 purchases of inventory. There is a maximum of one purchase per
month, with usage (reductions from stock) also occurring in most months. Each of the
columns in the exhibit show how the average cost is calculated after each purchase and
usage transaction.

We begin the illustration with the first row of calculations, which shows that we
have purchased 500 units of item BK0043 on May 3, 2007. These units cost $10.00 per
unit. During the month in which the units were purchased, 450 units were sent to
production, leaving 50 units in stock. Since there has been only one purchase thus far,
we can easily calculate, as shown in column 7, that the total inventory valuation is
$500, by multiplying the unit cost of $10.00 (in column 3) by the number of units left
in stock (in column 5). So far, we have a per-unit valuation of $10.00.

Next we proceed to the second row of the exhibit, where we have purchased
another 1,000 units of BK0043 on June 4, 2007. This purchase was less expensive,
since the purchasing volume was larger, so the per-unit cost for this purchase is only
$9.58. Only 350 units are sent to production during the month, so we now have 700
units in stock, of which 650 are added from the most recent purchase. To determine the
new weighted-average cost of the total inventory, we first determine the extended cost
of this newest addition to the inventory. As noted in column 7, we arrive at $6,227 by
multiplying the value in column 3 by the value in column 6. We then add this amount to
the existing total inventory valuation ($6,227 plus $500) to arrive at the new extended
inventory cost of $6,727, as noted in column 8. Finally, we divide this new extended
cost in column 8 by the total number of units now in stock, as shown in column 5, to
arrive at our new per-unit cost of $9.61.

The third row reveals an additional inventory purchase of 250 units on July 11,
2007, but more units are sent to production during that month than were bought, so the
total number of units in inventory drops to 550 (column 5). This inventory reduction
requires no review of inventory layers, as was the case for the LIFO and FIFO
calculations. Instead, we simply charge off the 150-unit reduction at the average
per-unit cost of $9.61. As a result, the ending inventory valuation drops to $5,286, with
the same per-unit cost of $9.61. Thus, reductions in inventory quantities under the
average costing method require little calculation—just charge off the requisite
number of units at the current average cost.

The remaining rows of the exhibit repeat the concepts just noted, alternatively
adding units to and deleting them from stock. Though there are a number of columns
noted in this exhibit that one must examine, it is really a simple concept to understand
and work with. The typical computerized accounting system will perform all of these
calculations automatically.

THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD

When each individual item of inventory can be clearly identified, it is possible to create
inventory costing records for each one, rather than summarizing costs by general
inventory type. This approach is rarely used, since the amount of paperwork and effort

associated with developing unit costs is far greater than under all other valuation
techniques. It is most applicable in businesses such as home construction, where there
are very few units of inventory to track, and where each item is truly unique.

7-6 WHICH INVENTORY CONTROLS SHOULD | INSTALL?

 

The accountant can certainly become involved in a plethora of controls that operate
throughout the receiving, storage, picking, and shipping functions. However, the
inventory controls of most importance to the accounting function are those relating to
inventory valuation, since the accountant is directly responsible for this area. The
following seven controls should be considered primary controls over the inventory
valuation process:

1. Review the bill of materials and labor routing change log. Alterations to the bill
of materials or labor routing files can have a significant impact on the inventory
valuation. To guard against unauthorized changes to these records, enable the
transaction change log of the software (if such a feature exists) and incorporate a
review of the change log into the month-end valuation calculation procedure.

2. Compare unextended product costs to those for prior periods. Product costs of all
types can change for a variety of reasons. An easy way to spot these changes is to
create and regularly review a report that compares the unextended cost of each
product with its cost in a prior period. Any significant changes can then be traced
back to the underlying costing information to see exactly what caused each
change. The main problem with this control is that many less expensive accounting
systems do not retain historical inventory records. If so, the information should be
exported to an electronic spreadsheet or separate database once a month, where
historical records can then be kept. An example of a cost changes report is shown
in Exhibit 7.6.

3. Review sorted list of extended product costs in declining dollar order. This report
is more commonly available than the historical tracking report noted in control

Exhibit 7.6 Cost Changes Report

number 2, but contains less information. The report lists the extended costs
of all inventory on hand for each inventory item, sorted in declining order of
cost. By scanning the report, one can readily spot items that have unusually
large or small valuations. However, finding these items requires some
knowledge of what costs were in previous periods. Also, a lengthy inventory
list makes it difficult to efficiently locate costing problems. Thus, this report is
inferior to the unextended historical cost comparison report from a control
perspective.

Review variances from standard cost. When the materials management depart-
ment creates a standard cost for an item, it is usually intended to be a very close
approximation of the current market price for that item. Consequently, an
excellent control is to run a monthly report comparing the standard cost and
most recent price paid for all items, with only those items appearing on the report
for which a significant dollar variance has occurred. This can indicate the
presence of such purchasing problems as supplier kickbacks or special-order
purchases that result in higher prices.

Investigate entries made to the inventory or cost of goods sold accounts. Because
the inventory and cost-of-goods-sold accounts are so large, it is more common for
employees attempting to hide fraudulent transactions to dump them into these
accounts. Accordingly, part of the standard month-end closing procedure should
include the printing and analysis of a report listing only the manual journal entries
made to these two accounts. This is also a good audit procedure for the internal
auditing department to complete from time to time.

Review inventory layering calculations. Most inventory layering systems are
automatically maintained through a computer system, and cannot be altered. In
these cases, there is no need to verify the layering calculations. However, if the
layering information is manually maintained, one should schedule periodic
reviews of the underlying calculations to ensure proper cost layering. This
usually involves tracing costs back to specific supplier invoices. However, one
should also trace supplier invoices forward to the layering calculations, since it is
quite possible that invoices have been excluded from the calculations. Also,
verify consistency in the allocation of freight and sales tax costs to inventory
items in the layering calculations.

Verify the calculation and allocation of overhead cost pools. Overhead costs are
usually assigned to inventory as the result of a manually derived summarization
and allocation of overhead costs. This can be a lengthy calculation, subject to
error. The best control over this process is a standard procedure that clearly
defines which costs to include in the pools and precisely how these costs are to be
allocated. In addition, regularly review the types of costs included in the
calculations, verify that the correct proportions of these costs are included,
and ensure that the costs are being correctly allocated to inventory. A further
control is to track the total amount of overhead accumulated in each reporting
period—any sudden change in the amount may indicate an error in the overhead
cost summarization.


7-6 Which Inventory Controls Should | Install? 185

The first three of the following controls are supplemental to the primary ones

already noted, mostly because they fall outside the normal month-end inventory
valuation procedure. Instead, they can be completed at any time, with a frequency
level dictated by the level of planned risk mitigation. The fourth control is an access
control to prevent employees from modifying key computer records. The controls are
as follows:

1. Audit inventory material costs. Inventory costs are usually assigned either through

a standard costing procedure or as part of some inventory layering concept such as
LIFO or FIFO. In the case of standard costs, one should regularly compare them to
the actual costs of materials purchased to see if any standard costs should be
updated to bring them more in line with actual costs incurred. If it is company policy
to update standard costs only at lengthy intervals, then verify that the variance
between actual and standard costs is being written off to the cost of goods sold.
If inventory layering is used to store inventory costs, then periodically audit
the costs in the most recently used layers, tracing inventory costs back to specific
supplier invoices.

2. Audit production setup cost calculations. If production setup costs are included

3.

in inventory unit costs, there is a possibility of substantial costing errors if the
assumed number of units produced in a production run is incorrect. For example,
if the cost of a production setup is $1,000 and the production run is 1,000 units,
then the setup cost should be $1 per unit. However, if someone wanted to
artificially increase the inventory valuation in order to increase profits, the
assumed production run size could be reduced. In the example, if the production
run assumption were dropped to 100 units, the cost per unit would increase
tenfold to $10. A reasonable control over this problem is to regularly review setup
cost calculations. An early warning indicator of this problem is to run a report
comparing setup costs over time for each product to see if there are any sudden
changes in costs. Also, access to the computer file storing this information should
be strictly limited.

Review inventory for obsolete items. The single largest cause of inventory
valuation errors is the presence of large amounts of obsolete inventory. To avoid
this problem, periodically print a report that lists which inventory items have not
been used recently, including the extended cost of these items. A more accurate
variation is to print a report itemizing all inventory items for which there are no
current production requirements (only possible if a material requirements planning
system is in place). Alternatively, create a report that compares the amount of
inventory on hand to annual historical usage of each item. With this information in
hand, one should then schedule regular meetings with the materials manager to
determine what inventory items should be scrapped, sold off, or returned to
suppliers. This concept is addressed more extensively in Section 7-2.

Control updates to bill of materials and labor routing costs. The key sources of
costing information are the bill of materials and labor routing records for each
product. One can easily make a few modifications to these records in order to


186 Management Accounting Best Practices

substantially alter inventory costs. To prevent such changes from occurring,
always impose strict security access over these records. If the accounting software
has a change-tracking feature that stores data about who made changes and what
changes were made, then be sure to use this feature. If used, periodically print a
report (if available) detailing all changes made to the records, and review it for
evidence of unauthorized access.

Because there are so many elements involved in inventory that can lead to an
incorrect inventory valuation, it is best to use all of the preceding controls as part of a
comprehensive system of valuation controls. Given the level of risk mitigation
involved, there is a greater payoff in using all of the controls than in eliminating a
few.

An additional inventory valuation activity is to conduct a periodic lower of cost
or market (LCM) valuation, which is outlined in Section 7-4. The following two
controls are sufficient for ensuring that an LCM analysis is completed on a regular
basis:

1. Follow a schedule of lower or cost or market reviews. The primary difficulty with
LCM reviews is that they are not done at all. Adding them to the financial closing
procedure, at least on a quarterly basis, will ensure that they are regularly
completed.

2. Follow a standard procedure for lower of cost or market reviews. It is not
uncommon for an LCM review to be very informal—perhaps a brief discussion
with the purchasing staff once a year regarding pricing levels for a few major
items. This approach does not ensure that all valuation problems will be
uncovered. A better approach is to formulate a standard LCM procedure.

7-7 WHAT TYPES OF PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS
SHOULD | USE?

 

The classic performance measurement used by accountants is inventory turnover.
Unfortunately, this measurement reveals only at an aggregated level the amount of
inventory on hand in relation to sales. There are other measurements available that
reveal a great many more issues that contribute to a company’s gross inventory
investment. This section itemizes the most useful ones.

PERCENTAGE OF NEW PARTS USED IN NEW PRODUCTS

A continuing problem for a company’s logistics staff is the volume of new parts that
the engineering department specifies for each new product. This can result in an
extraordinary number of parts to keep track of, which entails additional purchasing
and materials handling costs. From the perspective of saving costs for the entire
company, it makes a great deal of sense to encourage engineers to design products that


7-7 What Types of Performance Measurements Should | Use? 187

share components with existing products. This approach leverages new products from
the existing workload of the purchasing and materials handling staffs, and has the
added benefit of avoiding an investment in new parts inventory. For these reasons, the
percentage of new parts used in new products is an excellent choice of performance
measurement.

To measure it, divide the number of new parts in a bill of materials by the total
number of parts in a bill of materials. Many companies may not include fittings and
fasteners in the bill of materials, since they keep large quantities of these items on
hand at all times and charge them off to current expenses. If so, the number of parts to
include in the calculation will usually decline greatly, making the measurement much
easier to complete. The formula is as follows:

Number of new parts in bill of materials
Total number of parts in bill of materials

Engineers may argue against the use of this measurement on the grounds that it
provides a disincentive for them to locate more reliable and/or less expensive parts with
which to replace existing components. Though this measure can act as a block to such
beneficial activities, a measurement system can avoid this problem by also focusing on
long-term declines in the cost of products or increases in the level of quality.

BILL OF MATERIALS ACCURACY

The engineering department is responsible for the release of a bill of materials for each
product that it designs. The bill of materials should specify exactly what components
are needed to build a product, plus the quantities required for each part. The logistics
staff uses this information to ensure that the correct parts are available when the
manufacturing process begins. At least a 98 percent accuracy rating is needed for this
measurement in order to manufacture products with a minimum of stoppages due to
missing parts.

To calculate the measurement, divide the number of accurate parts (defined as the
correct part number, unit of measure, and quantity) listed in a bill of materials by the
total number of parts listed in the bill. The formula is as follows:

Number of accurate parts listed in bill of materials
Total number of parts listed in bill of materials

 

Though the minimum acceptable level of accuracy is 98 percent, this is an area
where nothing less than a 100 percent accuracy level is required in order to ensure that
the production process runs smoothly. Consequently, a great deal of attention should
be focused squarely on this measurement.

The timing of the release of the bill of materials is another problem. If an
engineering staff is late in issuing a proper bill of materials, then the logistics group
must scramble to bring in the correct parts in time for the start of the production


188 Management Accounting Best Practices

process. Measuring the timing of the bill’s release as well as its accuracy can avoid this
problem by focusing the engineering staff’s attention on it.

INVENTORY AVAILABILITY

One of the primary reasons for having inventory is to satisfy customer demand in a
timely manner. Maintaining a high level of inventory availability is usually cited as the
primary reason why companies keep such high levels of finished goods and service
parts on hand. Given this logic, one should measure a company’s success in filling
orders to see whether high inventory retention is working as a policy.

To measure inventory availability, divide the total number of completed orders
received by customers no later than their required date during the measurement period
by the total number of completed orders that customers should have received during the
measurement period. The calculation follows:

Total number of completed orders received by customer by required date
Total number of orders that should have been completed

 

The measurement emphasizes a successful order fulfillment as one received by the
customer on time, since the customer is not being served properly if the order was
merely shipped as of the required due date. Most company systems have no provision
for tracking customer receipt dates. To avoid this problem, a company can train the
order entry staff to subtract shipping time from a customer’s required date upon
receipt of the order, and enter the shortened date in the order entry system.

A company can falsely assume that it has a high availability rate if it counts any
sort of partial shipment as a completed order in the numerator, possibly on the grounds
that it has successfully shipped nearly all of an order. This measurement approach
certainly does not represent the view of the customer, which may very well stop using
the company on the basis of a “completed” order, which it sees as a failure.

AVERAGE BACK-ORDER LENGTH

When a company focuses solely on the inventory availability measurement just
described, the status of any items placed on back order tends to fall off the map. If a
customer cannot receive a shipment on time, it at least wants to receive it as soon
thereafter as possible, so a company should also track the average length of its back-
ordered items to ensure that customers are not excessively dissatisfied.

To measure the average back-order length, compile a list of all customer orders
that were not shipped on time and summarize from this list the total number of days
that each order has gone past the customer receipt date without being shipped. Then
divide this total number of days by the total number of back-ordered customer orders.
The calculation follows:

Sum of the [Number of days past the required
customer receipt date for each order]

 

Total number of back-ordered customer orders


7-7 What Types of Performance Measurements Should | Use? 189

Though the measurement is useful enough by itself, management will probably
want to see an accompanying list of the oldest back-ordered items so it can resolve
them as soon as possible.

INVENTORY ACCURACY

If a company’s inventory records are inaccurate, timely production of its products
becomes a near-impossibility. For example, if a key part is not located at the spot in
the warehouse where its record indicates it should be, or its indicated quantity is
incorrect, then the materials handling staff must frantically search for it and probably
issue a rush order to a supplier for more of it, while the production line remains
idle, waiting for the key raw materials. To avoid this problem, a company must
ensure not only that the quantity and location of a raw material are correct, but also that
its units of measure and part number are accurate. If any of these four items are
wrong, there is a strong chance that the production process will be negatively
impacted. Thus, inventory accuracy is one of the most important materials handling
measurements.

The measurement is to divide the number of accurate test items sampled by the
total number of items sampled. The definition of an accurate test item is one whose
actual quantity, unit of measure, description, and location match those indicated in the
warehouse records. If any one of these items is incorrect, then the test item should be
considered inaccurate. The formula is as follows:

Number of accurate test items
Total number of items sampled

It is extremely important to conduct this measurement using all four of the criteria
noted in the formula derivation. The quantity, unit of measure, description, and location
must match the inventory record. If this is not the case, then the reason for using it—
ensuring that the correct amount of inventory is on hand for production needs—will be
invalidated. For example, even if the inventory is available in the correct quantity, if its
location code is wrong, then no one can find it in order to use it in the production
process. Similarly, the quantity recorded may exactly match the amount located in the
warehouse, but this will still lead to an incorrect quantity if the unit of measure in the
inventory record is something different, such as dozens instead of inches.

INVENTORY TURNOVER

Inventory is frequently the largest component of a company’s working capital; in such
situations, if inventory is not being used up by operations at a reasonable pace, then a
company has invested a large part of its cash in an asset that may be difficult to


190 Management Accounting Best Practices

liquidate in short order. Accordingly, keeping close track of the rate of inventory
turnover is a significant function of management. Turnover should be tracked on a
trend line in order to see if there are gradual reductions in the rate of turnover, which
can indicate that corrective action is required to eliminate excess inventory stocks.

The most simple turnover calculation is to divide the period-end inventory into the
annualized cost of sales. One can also use an average inventory figure in the
denominator, which avoids sudden changes in the inventory level that are likely
to occur on any specific period-end date. The formula is as follows:

Cost of goods sold
Inventory

A variation on the preceding formula is to divide it into 365 days, which yields the
number of days of inventory on hand. This may be more understandable to the layman;
for example, 43 days of inventory is clearer than 8.5 inventory turns, even though they
represent the same situation. The formula is as follows:

365% ( Cost of Goods =)

Inventory

The turnover ratio can be skewed by changes in the underlying costing methods
used to allocate direct labor and especially overhead cost pools to the inventory. For
example, if additional categories of costs are added to the overhead cost pool, then the
allocation to inventory will increase, which will reduce the reported level of inventory
turnover—even though the turnover level under the original calculation method has
not changed at all. The problem can also arise if the method of allocating costs is
changed; for example, it may be shifted from an allocation based on labor hours
worked to one based on machine hours worked, which can alter the total amount of
overhead costs assigned to inventory. The problem can also arise if the inventory
valuation is based on standard costs, and the underlying standards are altered. In all
three cases, the amount of inventory on hand has not changed, but the costing systems
used have altered the reported level of inventory costs, which impacts the reported
level of turnover.

A separate issue is that the basic inventory turnover figure may not be sufficient
evidence of exactly where an inventory overage problem may lie. Accordingly, one
can subdivide the measurement so that there are separate calculations for raw
materials, work-in-process, and finished goods (which perhaps can be subdivided
further by location). This approach allows for more precise management of inventory-
related problems.

OBSOLETE INVENTORY PERCENTAGE

A company needs to know the proportion of its inventory that is obsolete, for several
reasons. First, external auditors will require that an obsolescence reserve be set up


7-7 What Types of Performance Measurements Should | Use? 191

against these items, which drastically lowers the inventory value and creates a charge
against current earnings. Second, constantly monitoring the level of obsolescence
allows a company to work on eliminating the inventory through such means as returns
to suppliers, taxable donations, and reduced-price sales to customers. Finally,
obsolete inventory takes up valuable warehouse space that could otherwise be put
to other uses; monitoring it with the obsolete inventory percentage allows manage-
ment to eliminate these items in order to reduce space requirements.

The measurement is to summarize the cost of all inventory items having no recent
usage, and divide by the total inventory valuation. The amount used in the numerator
is subject to some interpretation, since there may be occasional usage that will
eventually use up the amount left in stock, despite the fact that it has not been used for
some time. An alternative summarization method for the numerator that avoids this
problem is to include only those inventory items that do not appear on any bill of
materials for a currently produced item. The formula is as follows:

Cost of inventory items with no recent usage
Total inventory cost

 

PERCENTAGE OF RETURNABLE INVENTORY

Over time, a company will tend to accumulate either more inventory than it can use, or
inventory that is no longer used at all. These overaccumulations may be caused by an
excessively large purchase, or the scaling back of production needs below original
expectations, or perhaps a change in a product design that leaves some components
completely unnecessary. Whatever the reason may be, it is useful to review the
inventory occasionally in order to determine what proportion of it can be returned to
suppliers for cash or credit.

The measurement is to summarize all inventory items for which suppliers have
indicated that they will accept a return in exchange for cash or credit. For these items,
one may use in the numerator either the listed book value of returnable items or the net
amount of cash that can be realized by returning them (which will usually include a
restocking fee charged by suppliers). The first variation is used when a company is
more interested in the amount of total inventory that it can eliminate from its
accounting records, while the second approach is used when it is more interested
in the amount of cash that can be realized through the transaction. The denominator is
the book value of the entire inventory. The formula is as follows:

Dollars of returnable inventory
Total dollars of inventory

Even though a large proportion of the inventory may initially appear to be
returnable, one must also consider that near-term production needs may entail the


192 Management Accounting Best Practices

repurchase of some of those items, resulting in additional freight charges to
bring them back into the warehouse. Consequently, the underlying details of the
measurement should be reviewed in order to ascertain not only which items can
be returned, but also more specifically which ones can be returned that will not be
needed in the near term. This will involve the judgment of the logistics staff,
perhaps aided by a reorder quantity calculation, to see if it is cost justifiable to
return goods to a supplier that eventually will be needed again. A reduced version of
the measurement that avoids this problem is to include in the numerator only those
inventory items for which there is no production need whatsoever, irrespective of the
timeline involved.

7-8 HOW DO | MAINTAIN SERVICE LEVELS
WITH LOW INVENTORY?

 

A major ongoing debate within many departments of a company is the appropriate
level of inventory to maintain. If the market and sales managers want to achieve high
service levels, then stocking a high level of inventory seems necessary. However, this
increases working capital requirements and greatly increases the risk of incurring
obsolete inventory expenses. The accountant may find it helpful to use a set of analysis
tools to assist management with the calculation of the best possible investment level
for service parts. Here are some tools to consider:

¢ Throughput per customer. Know which customers generate the company’s cash
flow. This requires a knowledge of exactly which products each customer
purchases on an annualized basis, as well as the throughput (revenue minus
totally variable costs) of those products. It is entirely possible that a high-volume
customer may generate such an insignificant amount of cash that it is not worth an
excessive level of servicing, so there is no need to maintain a large inventory of
specialized service parts for it.

* Customer quality standards. Ever notice how some customers are pickier than
others? Some customers will require replacement of parts that would be
considered well within the quality specifications of other customers. If these
customers are the same ones with low throughput levels (see last item), then the
company needs to question not only its stocking levels, but also why it permits
them to be customers. Consequently, be sure to review the proportion of inventory
returns by customer.

* Customer complaints. Which inventory items do customers actually want the
company to have on hand for immediate delivery? Management may be surprised
to find that only a few items are “hot buttons,” and those hot buttons may not
even be overly expensive to keep on hand. It makes sense to spend a few
hours combing through the customer complaints log to see which stockouts
actually caused a problem. If the company does not have this information, then


7-8 How Do | Maintain Service Levels with Low Inventory? 193

set up an inexpensive online survey through an online surveying service such as
Survey Monkey ($20/month for a 1,000-response survey) and ask the customers.

* Call the user. Notice that the header for this point is ‘“‘call the user,” not “call the
customer.” There is a specific person within the customer’s organization who is
waiting for the company’s service parts to arrive. Find out who it is, and ask her
how soon she needs parts from the company. Not only is this a great way to
maintain customer contact and build repeat business, but the company can also
obtain an excellent view of precisely how its product is used, and therefore how
rapidly its system needs to fulfill any orders for the product. For example, if a
service part is needed by the customer on a key piece of manufacturing equipment
that will bring down the customer’s entire assembly line, then pre-positioning the
part in a nearby warehouse or on-site may be the level of servicing inventory
required. Alternatively, if the part is used only on backup equipment that is rarely
used, then a week-long delay may be entirely acceptable.

A key point is that not one of the items listed in this toolkit includes the more
common metrics, such as fulfillment rates, service levels, demand accuracy, or the
percentage of obsolete inventory. The appropriate level of inventory is extremely
difficult to determine when using such aggregate measures, because service levels can
vary so dramatically by individual product.

The typical warehouse may contain several thousand different products, so
conducting an analysis with the preceding toolkit for each individual item would
be prohibitively expensive. Instead, aggregate products by customer to see which ones
are used only by low-throughput customers, and then assign them a low level of
stocking priority. Next, aggregate products by type, and determine the level of
customer need for each inventory type by using the direct contact or customer
complaint tools. This quick aggregation approach greatly reduces the effort required
to determine the correct stocking levels needed for different types of inventory.

The preceding discussion addressed ways to determine inventory levels for
individual inventory items. In addition, some general techniques are available for
reducing all types of inventory without reducing service levels. They are as follows:

* Consolidate smaller, local warehouses into a single regional warehouse. By
doing so, the company needs to maintain safety stock only at one location, rather
than once at each warehouse.

© Centralize slow-moving inventory. If an item turns over very slowly, then it may
be cost-effective to store it in just one place (not even in a few regional
warehouses). The trade-off here is an absolute minimum amount of safety stock
versus possibly higher shipping costs.

¢ Buy in smaller quantities. This may result in more frequent deliveries, so there
may be a cost trade-off. At a minimum, avoid any purchasing “‘deals’’ where the
company buys vast quantities of goods in exchange for a price break.

¢ Shrink production runs. A major cause of excessive inventory is production runs
that greatly exceed the amount of customer orders. If there are no orders, don’t


194 Management Accounting Best Practices

load up the warehouse with extra units. And above all, don’t operate the
production equipment just to keep the staff busy. If there is no demand, then
do not produce it.

¢ Shrink the number of product options. Does the company really need to sell a
product in blue, green, red, and pink, as well as with an optional confabulator?
Though marketing will be annoyed, try to stock only one or two product
variations. At a minimum, store only a moderate number of subunits that can
be quickly altered at the last minute into a variety of configurations, rather than
storing lots of the final configurations.

Another concept that can reduce inventory levels without impacting service levels
is risk pooling. This is the concept that safety stock levels can be reduced for parts that
are used in a large number of products, because fluctuations in the demand levels of
parent products will offset each other, resulting in a lower safety stock level.

For example, engineers are usually instructed to use common parts in more than
one product, so that fewer total parts can be stocked (another inventory reduction
technique). A useful side benefit of this approach is that the fluctuations in the demand
levels of a single part by multiple parent products will offset each other. This results in
a smaller standard deviation in usage levels for a part having multiple sources of
demand, as opposed to the usage deviation for parts with fewer sources of demand.

In order to reduce safety stock levels for parts having multiple sources of demand,
use a simple trial-and-error approach of determining the actual stockout level of these
items over a rolling three-month period, and gradually reducing the in-stock balance
until the mandated service level is reached. For these items, the safety stock level will
likely be substantially below the average corporate safety stock level.

This section has addressed multiple ways to reduce inventory levels without
impacting service levels: by the profit level generated, actual customer need, storage
centralization, product configuration, purchasing and producing in smaller quantities,
and risk pooling. Only by attacking the problem with most of these tools will a
company experience a significant decline in its inventory levels while continuing to
provide a high level of customer support.

7-9 SHOULD | SHIFT INVENTORY OWNERSHIP
TO SUPPLIERS?

 

If a company is attempting to reduce its inventory investment, the materials manage-
ment staff may suggest that raw materials be shifted back to suppliers as consignment
inventory that is stored on the company’s premises.

The most common approach to consignment inventory management is for the
supplier to maintain a sufficient quantity of inventory at the company to ensure a
sufficient on-hand supply until its next replenishment visit. During each visit, the
supplier counts the amount of inventory used since its last visit, replenishes stock, and


7-10 How Do | Avoid Price Protection Costs? 195

invoices the company for the amount used. Though this approach initially appears to
be a good one from the perspective of the company, it has some problems.

From a cost perspective, the company will still incur the cost of the storage space
taken up by the consigned inventory. This storage space may be significant, since the
supplier will prefer to retain sufficient on-site inventory to keep it from returning to
review the inventory too frequently. Also, the company may be held liable for any
consignment inventory that becomes obsolete, especially if the supplier has custom-
designed the goods for the company. Further, there is a significant cost associated with
the initial consignment contract creation, as well as ongoing contract maintenance.
And finally, suppliers may find ways to shift the financing cost of that inventory back
onto the company, either through higher prices or lower product quality.

An additional problem is that many materials management systems are not
designed to track consignment inventory, requiring painstaking manual procedures
to coordinate activities with suppliers.

The impact of these issues is that working capital will decline somewhat, while
materials and administrative costs will increase. A better approach is to work with
suppliers to mutually reduce the total amount of inventory in the supply chain. Since
inventory is mostly a buffer to compensate for variations in the output of the supplier
and the demand of the company, it is better to coordinate forecasts, thereby reducing
the need for the buffer.

Consequently, the accountant should spend considerable time analyzing the total
cost of a proposed inventory consignment arrangement, not just the proposed initial
improvement in cash flow.

7-10 HOW DO | AVOID PRICE PROTECTION COSTS?

 

A company with a distribution network sometimes finds it necessary to engage in
price protection, where it reimburses its distributors for any price reductions on
products they still have in stock. By doing so, the distributor does not have to sell at a
loss. This is a particular concern in the consumer electronics market, where product
prices decline continually as a result of price wars.

There are several ways to minimize these price protection costs. First, deliberately
ship in smaller quantities, with more frequent replenishment cycles, thereby pre-
venting distributors from building up large inventory stockpiles on which price
protection payments must be made. If distributors resist this approach, then offer them
incentives to do so that cost less than the projected savings from the price protection
costs.

Second, join with the distributors in using collaborative forecasting and replen-
ishment. Ideally, this means that the company has direct access to each distributor’s
inventory database, and can see sales trends and stocking levels in real-time. This
allows the company to precisely tailor the size and timing of shipments to avoid price
protection costs.


196 Management Accounting Best Practices

Third, do not allow distributors to order in excessively large volumes. This can be
most easily done by not offering volume discounts. However, overordering can be a
significant problem simply because price protection and inventory return policies are
excessively liberal, since distributors know they can return whatever they do not sell.
Thus, some degree of restriction in these policies will almost certainly lead to less
overordering.

Cost Allocation Decisions

At a basic level, the allocation of overhead costs is simply a response to meet the
requirements of various accounting standards. However, overhead allocation can also
be used (and misused) to arrive at a number of decisions, such as the profitability of
products, customers, and operating divisions. This chapter shows how to properly use
cost allocation through the use of activity-based costing, while also revealing several
flaws in the use of any allocation technique that can result in incorrect management
decisions. The following table itemizes the section number in which the answers to
each question posed in this chapter can be found:

8-1 WHAT IS THE BASIC METHOD FOR
CALCULATING OVERHEAD?

 

There are two factors that go into the production of the overhead number. One is
the compilation of the overhead pool, which yields the grand total of all overhead
costs that will subsequently be allocated to each product. The second factor is the
allocation method that is used to determine how much of the fixed cost is allocated to
each unit.

The overhead cost pool can contain a wide array of costs that are related to the
production of a specific product in varying degrees. For example, there may be
machine-specific costs, such as setup, depreciation, maintenance, and repairs, that
have some reasonably traceable connection to a specific product at the batch level.
Other overhead costs, such as building maintenance or insurance, are related more
closely to the building in which the production operation is housed, and have a much
looser connection to a specific product. The overhead cost pool may also contain costs
for the management or production scheduling of an entire production line, as well as

197


198 Management Accounting Best Practices

the costs of distributing product to customers. Given the wide-ranging nature of these
costs, it is evident that a hodgepodge of costs is being accumulated into a single cost
pool, which almost certainly will result in very inaccurate allocations to individual
products.

The allocation method is the other factor that impacts the cost of overhead. The
most common method of allocation is based on the amount of direct labor dollars
used to create a product. This method can cause considerable cost misallocations,
because the amount of labor in a product may be so much smaller than the quantity of
overhead cost to be allocated that anywhere from $1 to $4 may be allocated to a
product for every $1 of direct labor cost in it. Given the high ratio of overhead to
direct labor, it is very easy for the amount of overhead charged to a product to swing
drastically in response to a relatively minor shift in direct labor costs. A classic
example of this problem is what happens when a company decides to automate a
product line. When it does so, it incurs extra costs associated with new machinery,
which adds to the overhead cost pool. Meanwhile, the amount of direct labor in the
product plummets, due to the increased level of automation. Consequently, the
increased amount of overhead, which is directly associated with the newly automated
production line, is allocated to other products whose production has not yet been
automated. This means that the overhead cost of a product that is created by an
automated production line does not have enough overhead cost allocated to it, while
the overhead cost assigned to more labor-intensive products is too high.

There are solutions to the problems of excessively congregated cost pools, as well
as allocations based on direct labor. One is to split the single overhead allocation pool
into a small number of overhead cost pools. Each of these pools should contain costs
that are closely related to each other. For example, there may be an assembly overhead
cost pool (as noted in Exhibit 8.1) that contains only those overhead costs associated
with the assembly operation, such as janitorial costs, the depreciation and main-
tenance on assembly equipment, and the supervision costs of that area. Similarly,
there can be another cost pool (as also noted in Exhibit 8.1) that summarizes all
fabrication costs. This pool may contain all costs associated with the manufacture and
procurement of all component parts, which includes the costs of machinery setup,
depreciation, and maintenance, as well as purchasing salaries. Finally, there can be an
overall plant overhead cost pool that includes the costs of building maintenance,
supervision, taxes, and insurance. It may not be useful to exceed this relatively
limited number of cost pools, for the complexity of cost tracking can become
excessive. The result of this process is a much better summarization of costs.

Each of the newly created cost pools can then be assigned a separate cost allocation
method that has a direct relationship between the cost pool and the product being
created. For example, the principal activity in the assembly operation is direct labor,
so this time-honored allocation method can be retained when allocating the costs of
the assembly overhead cost pool to products. However, the principal activity in the
fabrication area is machine hours, so this becomes the basis of allocation for
fabrication overhead costs. Finally, all building-related costs are best apportioned
through the total square footage of all machinery, inventory, and related operations

used by each product, so square footage becomes the basis of allocation for this cost
pool.

The result of these changes, as noted in Exhibit 8.1, is an altered bill of materials
that replaces a single overhead cost line item with three different overhead costs, each
one being allocated based on the most logical allocation measure.

8-2 HOW DOES ACTIVITY-BASED COSTING WORK?

 

Activity-based costing (ABC) was invented in order to bring some relevance to the
allocation of overhead, which results in better information and related management
decisions.

An ABC system begins with a determination of the scope of the project. This is a
critical item, for creating an ABC system that encompasses every aspect of every
department of all corporate subsidiaries will take an inordinate amount of time and
resources, and may never show valuable results for several years, if ever. To control
this problem, we first determine the range of activities that the ABC system is to
encompass, and the results desired from the system. It is not usually necessary to
create an ABC system for simple processes for which the costs can be readily
separated and reported on. Instead, activities that are deserving of inclusion in an ABC
system are those that include many machines, involve complex processes, use


200 Management Accounting Best Practices

automation, require many machine setups, or support a diverse product line. These
are areas in which costs are difficult to clearly and indisputably assign to products
or other cost objects.

Another scope issue is the extent to which the ABC system is to be integrated into
the existing accounting system. If the project is to be handled on a periodic recal-
culation basis, rather than one that is automatically updated whenever new infor-
mation is introduced into the accounting system, then all linkages can be no more
than manual retyping of existing information into a separate ABC. However, a fully
integrated ABC system will require the extensive coding of software interfaces
between the two systems, which is both time-consuming and expensive. These
changes may include some alteration of the corporate chart of accounts, the cost
center structure, and the cost and revenue distributions used by the accounts payable
and billing functions. These are major changes, so the level of system integration
should be a large proportion of the scope discussions.

A final scope issue is a determination of how many costs from nonproduction
areas should be included in the system. For those companies that have proportio-
nately large production departments, this may not be an issue; but for service
companies or those with large development departments, these other costs can be a
sizeable proportion of total costs, and so should be included in the ABC system.
These costs can come from areas as diverse as the R&D, product design, marketing,
distribution, computer services, janitorial, and administration functions. Adding
each new functional area will increase the administrative cost of the ABC system, so
a key issue in scope determination is whether the cost of each functional area is large
enough to have an impact on the activity costs calculated by the ABC system. Costs
with negligible impact should be excluded.

Once we have determined the scope, next we must separate all direct materials and
labor costs and set them to one side. These costs are quite adequately identified by
most existing accounting systems already, so it is usually a simple matter to identify
and segregate the general ledger accounts in which these costs are stored. The
remaining costs in the general ledger should be ones that can be allocated.

Next, using our statement of the scope of the project, we can identify those costs in
the general ledger that are to be allocated through the ABC system. For example, if the
primary concern of the new system is to determine the cost of the sales effort on each
product sale, then finding the sales and marketing costs will be the primary concern.
Alternatively, if the purpose of the ABC system is to find the distribution cost per unit,
then only those costs associated with warehousing, shipping, and freight must be
located.

With the designated overhead costs in hand, we then proceed to store costs into
secondary, or resource, cost pools. A secondary cost pool is one that provides services
to other company functions, without directly providing services to any activities that
create products or services. Examples of resource costs are administrative salaries,
building maintenance, and computer services. The costs stored in these cost pools will
later be charged to other cost pools with various activity measures, so the costs should
be stored in separate pools that can be allocated with similar allocation measures. For


8-2 How Does Activity-Based Costing Work? 201

example, computer services costs may be allocated to other cost pools based on the
number of personal computers used, so any costs that can be reasonably and logically
allocated based on the number of personal computers used should be stored in the
same resource cost pool.

Ina similar manner, we then store all remaining overhead costs in a set of primary
cost pools. There can be a very large number of cost pools for the storage of similar
costs, but one should consider that the cost of administering the ABC system (unless it
is arare case of full automation) will increase with each cost pool added. Accordingly,
it is best to keep the number of cost pools under 10. There are a few standard cost pool
descriptions that are used in most companies. They are as follows:

¢ Batch-related cost pools. Many costs, such as purchasing, receiving, production
control, shop floor control, tooling, setup labor, supervision, training, materials
handling, and quality control are related to the length of production batches.

¢ Product line-related cost pools. A group of products may have incurred the same
research and development, advertising, purchasing, and distribution costs. It may
be necessary to split this category into separate cost pools if there are a number of
different distribution channels, if the costs of the channels differ dramatically
from each other.

¢ Facility-related cost pools. Some costs cannot be directly allocated to specific
products, because they relate more closely to the entire facility. These costs
include building insurance, building maintenance, and facility depreciation.

Other cost pools can be added to these three basic cost pools, if the results will
yield a significantly improved level of accuracy, or if the extra cost pools will lead to
the attainment of the goals and scope that were set at the beginning of the project. In
particular, the batch-related cost pool can be subdivided into a number of smaller cost
pools depending on the number of different operations within a facility. For example,
a candy-making plant will have a line of cookers, the cost of which can be included in
one cost pool, while the cost of its candy extruder machines can be segregated into a
separate cost pool and its cellophane wrapper machines into yet another cost pool.
Costs may be allocated quite differently, depending on the type of machine used, so
separating this category into a number of smaller cost pools may make sense.

Costs cannot always be directly mapped from general ledger accounts into cost
pools. Instead, there may be valid reasons for splitting general ledger costs into
different cost pools. If so, an allocation method must be found that logically splits
these costs. This method is termed a resource driver. Examples of resource drivers are
the number of products produced, direct labor hours, and the number of production
orders used. Whatever the type of resource driver selected, it should provide a logical
and defendable means for redirecting costs from a general ledger account into a cost
pool. There should be a minimal number of resource drivers, because time and effort is
required to accumulate each one. In reality, most companies will use management
judgment to arrive at a set percentage of each account that is allocated to cost pools,
rather than using any formal resource driver at all. For example, the cost of computer


202 Management Accounting Best Practices

depreciation may be allocated 50 percent to a secondary cost pool, 40 percent to a
batch-related primary cost pool, and 10 percent to a facility-related primary cost pool,
because these percentages roughly reflect the number of personal computers located
at various parts of the facility, which in turn is considered a reasonable means for
spreading these costs among different cost pools.

There are varying levels of detailed analysis that one can use to assign costs to cost
pools. The level of analysis will be largely driven by the need for increasingly detailed
levels of information; if there is less need for accuracy, then a less expensive method
can be used. For example, if there are three cost pools into which the salaries of the
purchasing department can be stored, depending on the actual activities conducted,
then the easiest and least accurate approach is to make a management decision to send
a certain percentage of the total cost into each one. A higher level of accuracy would
require that the employees be split up into job categories, with varying percentages
being allocated from each category. Finally, the highest level of accuracy would
require time tracking by employee, with a fresh recalculation after every set of time-
sheets is collected. The level of accuracy needed, the size of the costs being allocated,
and the cost of the related data collection, will drive the decision to collect information
at progressively higher levels of accuracy.

The next step is to allocate all of the costs stored in the secondary cost pools into
the primary cost pools. This is done with activity drivers, which we will explain
shortly. By allocating these cost pools to primary cost pools, we cause a redistribu-
tion of costs to occur that then can be further allocated from the primary cost pools,
with considerable accuracy, to cost objects. This subsidiary step of allocating costs
from resource cost centers to primary cost centers can be avoided by sending all costs
straight from the general ledger to the primary cost pools, but several studies have
shown that this more direct approach does not do as good a job of accurately
allocating costs. The use of resource cost centers more precisely reflects how costs
flow through an organization—from resource activities such as the computer services
department to other departments, which in turn are focused on activities that are used
to create cost objects.

Now that all costs have been allocated into primary cost pools, we must find a way
to accurately charge these costs to cost objects, which are the users of the costs.
Examples of cost objects are products and customers. We perform this allocation with
an activity driver. This is a variable that explains the consumption of costs from a cost
pool. There should be a clearly defined cause-and-effect relationship between the cost
pool and the activity, so that there is a solid and defensible reason for using a specific
activity driver. This is a very key area, for the use of specific activity drivers will
change the amount of costs charged to cost objects, which can raise the ire of the
managers who are responsible for those cost objects. Exhibit 8.2 itemizes a number of
activity drivers that relate to specific types of costs.

The list of activities presented in Exhibit 8.2 is by no means comprehensive.
Each company has unique processes and costs that may result in the selection of
different activity drivers from the ones noted here. There are several key issues to
consider when selecting an activity driver. They are as follows:

* Minimize data collection. Very few activity drivers are already tracked through the
existing accounting system, since few of them involve costs. Instead, they are more
related to actions, such as the number of supplier reviews, or the number of customer
orders processed. These are numbers that may not be tracked anywhere in the
existing system, and so will require extra effort to compile. Consequently, if there
are few differences between several potential activity drivers, pick the one that is
already being measured, thereby saving the maintenance work for the ABC system.


204 Management Accounting Best Practices

¢ Pick low-cost measurements. If it is apparent that the only reasonable activity
measures are ones that must be collected “from scratch,” then (all other items being
equal) pick the one with the lowest data collection cost. This is a particularly
important consideration if the ABC project is operating on a tight budget, or if there
is concern by employees that the new system is taking up too many resources.

¢ Verify a cause-and-effect relationship. The activity driver must have a direct
bearing on the incurrence of the costs in the cost pool. To test this, perform a
regression analysis; if the regression reveals that changes in the activity driver
have a direct and considerable impact on the size of the cost pool, then it is a
good driver to use. It is also useful if the potential activity driver is one that can
be used as an element of improvement change. For example, if management can
focus the attention of the organization on reducing the quantity of the activity
driver, then this will result in a smaller cost pool.

Once an activity driver has been selected for each cost pool, we then divide the
total volume of each activity for the accounting period into the total amount of costs
accumulated into each cost pool to derive a cost per unit of activity. For example, if
the activity measure is the number of insurance claims processed, and there are 350 in
the period, then if they were to be divided into a human resources benefits cost pool of
$192,000, the resulting cost per claim processed would be $549.

Our next step is to determine the quantity of each activity that is used by the cost
object. To do so, we need a measurement system that accumulates the quantity of
activity drivers used for each cost object. This measurement system may very well not
be in existence yet, and so must be specially constructed for the ABC system. If the
cost of this added data collection is substantial, then there will be considerable
pressure to reduce the number of activity drivers, which represents a trade-off between
accuracy and system cost.

Finally, we have reached our goal, which is to accurately assign overhead costs to
cost objects. To do so, we multiply the cost per unit of activity by the number of units
of each activity used by the cost objects. This should flush out all of the costs located in
the cost pools and assign them to cost objects in their entirety. By doing so, we have
found not only a defensible way to assign overhead costs in a manner that is
understandable, but more importantly, a way that managers can use to reduce those
costs. For example, if the activity measure for the overhead costs associated with the
purchasing function’s cost is the number of different parts ordered for each product,
then managers can focus on reducing the activity measure, which entails a reduction in
the number of different parts included in each product. By doing so, the amount of
purchasing overhead will indeed be reduced, for it is directly associated with and
influenced by this activity driver. Thus, the ABC system is an excellent way to focus
attention on costs that can be eliminated.

The explanation of ABC has been a lengthy one, so let us briefly recap it. After
setting the scope of the ABC system, we allocate costs from the general ledger to
secondary and primary cost pools, using resource drivers. We then allocate
the costs of the secondary cost pools to the primary ones. Next, we create activity


8-2 How Does Activity-Based Costing Work? 205

drivers that are closely associated with the costs in each of the cost pools, and derive
a cost per unit of activity. We then accumulate the number of units of each activity
that are used by each cost object (such as a product or customer), and multiply the
number of these units by the cost per activity driver. This procedure completely
allocates all overhead costs to the cost objects in a reasonable and logical manner.
An overview of the process is shown in Exhibit 8.3.

8-3 HOW SHOULD | USE ACTIVITY-BASED COSTING?

 

The number of uses to which an ABC system can be put are only limited by the
imagination of the user. Here are some of its more common applications:

¢ How do we increase shareholder value? When an ABC analysis is combined
with a review of investment costs for various tactical or strategic options, one can
determine the return on investment to be expected for each of the investment
options.

¢ How much does a distribution channel cost? An ABC system can accumulate
all of the costs associated with a particular distribution method, which allows
managers to compare this cost to the profit margins earned on sales of pro-
ducts that are sold through it. One can then determine if the distribution channel
should be reconfigured or eliminated in order to improve overall levels of
profitability.

¢ How do product costs vary by plant? An ABC analysis will itemize the costs of
each plant, and correctly allocate these costs to the activities conducted within
them, which allows a company to determine which plants are more efficient than
others.

¢ Should we make or buy an item? An ABC analysis includes all activity costs
associated with a manufactured item, which yields a comprehensive view of all
costs associated with it, and which can then be more easily compared with the
cost of a similar item that is purchased.

* What acquisition is a good one? By using internal ABC analyses to determine
the cost of various activities, a company can create a benchmark for what these
costs should be in potential acquisition targets. If the targets have higher costs
than the benchmark levels, then the acquiring company knows that it can strip
out costs from the acquisition candidate by improving its processes, which
may justify the cost of the acquisition.

* What does each activity cost? An ABC analysis can reveal the cost of each
activity within an organization. The system is really designed to trace the
costs of only the most significant activities, but its design can be altered
to itemize the costs of many more activities. This information can then be
used to determine which activities are so expensive that they will be the main
focus of management attention, or which can be profitably combined with
other activities through process centering. This is a primary cost-reduction
activity.

¢ What price should we charge? An ABC analysis reveals all of the costs asso-
ciated with a product, and so is useful for determining the minimum price that
should be charged. However, the actual price charged may be much higher, since
this may be driven by the ability of the market to absorb a higher price, rather than
the underlying cost of a product.


8-4 Are There Any Problems with Activity-Based Costing? 207

¢ What products should we sell? An ABC analysis can be combined with pro-
duct prices to yield a list of margins for each product sold. When sorted by
market, product line, or customer, it is easy to see which products have low or
negative returns, or which yield such low margin volume that they are not
worth keeping.

¢ Where are the non-value-added costs? An ABC analysis can reveal which
activities contribute to the completion of products, and which do not. Then, by
focusing on non-value-added activities, a company can create significant im-
provements in its profitability.

¢ Where can we reduce costs? An ABC analysis reveals the cost of anything
that a management team needs to know about—activities, products, or
customers—which can then be sorted to see where the highest-cost items
are located. When combined with a value analysis, one can determine what
costs return the lowest values, and structure a cost-reduction effort accord-
ingly.

* Which customers do we want? An ABC analysis can itemize the costs that are
specific to each customer, such as special customer service or packaging issues,
as well as increased levels of warranty claims or product returns. When added to
the margins on products sold to customers, this reveals which customers are the
most profitable after all costs are considered.

The main issue involving ABC usage is that it be addressed before the system is
installed, for the design of the system is heavily dependent on the uses to which ABC
will be put.

8-4 ARE THERE ANY PROBLEMS WITH
ACTIVITY-BASED COSTING?

 

Though an ABC system solves a great many problems, it also has several attendant
problems that have resulted in many system installation failures. One should be aware
of the problems noted in this section, and resolve as many of them as possible in the
earliest stages of an ABC system installation, in order to ensure a higher degree of
success.

A key underlying problem is that company managers hear about the won-
ders of ABC and demand that it be installed at once—without considering
whether the organization actually needs it. ABC is most useful in situations
where the cost accounting information is extremely muddied by the presence
of multiple product lines, machines that are used to process different products,
complex routings, automation, and many machine setups. If a company does
not have any of these criteria, it may not need an ABC system. For example,
a company with a single product line, one production facility, and a small


208 Management Accounting Best Practices

number of customers can probably generate reasonably accurate costing infor-
mation from its existing general ledger system without resorting to a lengthy
ABC installation. Those companies that persist in installing ABC under these
circumstances may find that they have achieved only a minor improvement in
accuracy at the price of having a second accounting system layered over the
existing one.

Another issue is the time required to create an ABC system. This can be a lengthy
undertaking, especially if the desired system is a comprehensive one that straddles
multiple product lines and facilities. A project of this magnitude can easily require
more than a year to complete. For work of this duration, there is a greater chance that
opponents of the project will start sniping at it after a few months have passed without
any tangible results. In short, the longer the project duration, the greater the chance of
its being terminated prior to completion. This problem can be avoided by closely
defining the scope of the ABC project into an area that can be completed, at least as a
pilot project, within a much smaller time frame. By taking this approach, one can
show concrete and valuable results in short order, which builds enthusiasm for a
continuing series of ABC projects that gradually cover the key areas of a company’s
operations.

A major problem in many instances is that an ABC system draws information
from and reports on the activities of many departments, which draws their ire. If
a sufficient number of department managers are irritated by the reports issued by
the ABC system, they can use a variety of methods to withhold information from
it, so that the system no longer yields a sufficient amount of information to make
it worthwhile. To avoid this problem, ensure that a high-level manager has taken
personal responsibility for the ABC project, so that any interdepartmental
problems can be dealt with both quickly and in favor of the ABC system. This
also means that great care must be taken to hand off this project-sponsor position
to succeeding individuals who have an equally high degree of enthusiasm for
ABC.

A further issue is that an ABC system almost always involves the construction
of a separate set of data from the general ledger. If this second database becomes
so massive that it is unwieldy to use, or if the data contained in it diverges sharply
from the information contained in the general ledger, there will be significant
resistance to it within the accounting department. This conflict will arise because
staff time must be spent on maintenance (very likely including the hiring of extra
cost accounting staff) and the results of the system may be difficult to trace back
to the company’s financial reports, which entails additional effort by the
accounting staff. Thus, a higher workload can produce resistance within the
accounting department. To avoid this problem, it is necessary to properly design
the ABC system so that it collects the minimum possible amount of extra
information besides what is already stored in the general ledger. By doing so,
data collection and maintenance requirements are reduced, while there is less
trouble in tracing ABC numbers back to the general ledger. System simplification
is key to avoiding this problem.


8-5 How Do Just-in-Time Systems Impact Cost Allocation? 209

Reporting is also a problem. The users of accounting reports may have been
accustomed to seeing the same accounting reports for a number of years, and might
not want to put the effort into learning to read new ones. Instead, they continue to use
the old reports, and ignore the new ones. The obvious solution to this problem is
to phase out or restrict access to the old reports, while providing training on the
use of the new reports. Follow-up training is crucial, since users may not at first
understand the concept of activity-based costing.

Another issue is the trade-off between the number of cost pools used and
the level of accuracy obtained. If costs are summarized into too few cost pools, the
resulting level of information accuracy is reduced, while an increase in the num-
ber of cost pools (and therefore a finer level of overhead allocation) will result in
more accurate costing. The trouble is that the ABC system becomes much more
expensive and complex to operate if there are too many cost pools. To resolve this
issue, it is useful to create an analysis of the incremental costs required to maintain
each additional cost pool that is added to the ABC model, and to stop when the
costs exceed a preset threshold, or when the level of complexity appears to become
excessive.

A final issue is that the ABC system is frequently set up to be repeated on a project
basis, which means that it requires continual reauthorization to reiterate. Because it
is a project, it can be killed through reduced funding or staffpower whenever the
next project renewal review occurs. ABC information is frequently derived on a
project basis, because it is too expensive to continually collect and process ABC
information on a continuing basis. To avoid this issue, one can alter the ABC system so
that some portions of it are designed into the existing cost accounting system, so that
some ABC information is constantly updated while only a small part of the infor-
mation is still obtained on a project basis. Any ABC information that is easy to col-
lect and interpret, or which yields immediate and continuing information of great
importance, can be included in the ongoing ABC system. More peripheral ABC
information can be collected on a project basis. This format will retain the most crucial
ABC information, even if the ancillary ABC project that collects secondary data is
dropped.

8-5 HOW DO JUST-IN-TIME SYSTEMS IMPACT
COST ALLOCATION?

 

The chief difference between the types of cost allocations in a JIT environment and a
traditional one is that most overhead costs are converted to direct costs. The primary
reason for this change is the machine cell. Because a machine cell is designed to
produce either a single product or a single component that goes into a similar product
line, all of the costs generated by that machine cell can be charged directly to the only
product it produces. When a company completely converts to the use of machine cells
in all locations, then the costs related to all of those cells can now be charged directly


210 Management Accounting Best Practices

to products, which leaves very little costs of any kind left to be allocated through a
more traditional overhead cost pool. The result of this change is much more accurate
product costs, and little debate over where allocated costs should go—since there
aren’t enough of them left to be worth the argument.

To be specific about which costs can now be charged directly to a product, they are
as follows:

¢ Depreciation. The depreciation cost of each machine in a machine cell can be
charged directly to a product. It may be possible to depreciate a machine based on
its actual usage, rather than charging off a specific amount per month, since this
allocation variation more accurately shifts costs to a product.

¢ Electricity. The power used by the machines in a cell can be separately metered
and then charged directly to the products that pass through that cell. Any excess
electricity cost charged to the facility as a whole will still have to be charged to
an overhead cost pool for allocation.

¢ Materials handling. Most materials handling costs in a JIT system are elimi-
nated, since machine operators move parts around within their machine cells.
Only materials handling costs between cells should be charged to an overhead
cost pool for allocation.

* Operating supplies. Supplies are mostly used within the machine cells, so the
vast majority of items in this expense category can be separately tracked by
individual cell and charged to products.

¢ Repairs and maintenance. Nearly all of the maintenance that a company incurs
is spent on machinery, and this is all grouped into machine cells. By having
the maintenance staff charge their time and materials to these cells, their costs
can be charged straight to products. Only maintenance work on the facility will
still be charged to an overhead cost pool.

¢ Supervision. If supervision is by machine cell, then the cost of the supervisor
can be split among the cells supervised. However, the cost of general facility
management, as well as of any support staff, must still be charged to an overhead
cost pool.

As noted in several places in the preceding bullet points, a few remainder costs
will still be charged to an overhead cost pool for allocation. However, this constitutes
a small percentage of the costs, with nearly everything now being allocable to
machine cells. Only building occupancy costs, insurance, and taxes are still charged
in full to an overhead cost pool. This is a vast improvement over the amount of money
that the traditional system allocates to products. A typical overhead allocation pool
under the traditional system may easily include 75 percent of all costs incurred,
whereas this figure can be dropped to less than 25 percent of total costs by switching
to a JIT system. With such a higher proportion of direct costs associated with each
product, managers will then have much more relevant information about the true cost
of each product manufactured.


8-8 How Does Overhead Allocation Impact Low-Profit Products? 211

8-6 HOW DOES OVERHEAD ALLOCATION IMPACT
AUTOMATED PRODUCTION SYSTEMS?

 

Traditional cost allocation systems tend to portray products made with high levels
of automation as being deceptively low in overhead cost. For example, if a high-
technology company decides to introduce more automation into one of its
production lines, it will replace direct labor with machine hours by adding robots.
This will shrink the allocation base, which is direct labor, while increasing the size
of the overhead cost pool, which now includes the depreciation, utilities, and
maintenance costs associated with the robots. When the overhead cost allocation is
performed, a smaller amount of overhead will be charged to the now-automated
production line, because the overhead costs are being charged based on direct labor
usage, which has declined. This makes the products running through the automated
line look less expensive than they really are. Furthermore, the increased overhead
cost pool will be charged to those production lines with lots of direct labor, even
though these other product lines have not the slightest association with the new
overhead costs. The end result is a significant skewing of reported costs that makes
products manufactured with automation look less expensive than they really are,
and those produced with manual labor look more expensive.

8-7 HOW DOES OVERHEAD ALLOCATION IMPACT
LOW-VOLUME PRODUCTS?

 

Traditional cost allocation systems tend to portray low-volume products as those
with the highest profits. This problem arises because the overhead costs associated
with batch setups and teardowns, which can be a significant proportion of total
overhead costs, are allocated indiscriminately to products that have both large
and small production volumes; there is no allocation to a specific short pro-
duction run of the special batch costs associated with it. This results in under-
costing of products with short production runs, and overcosting of products with
long production runs. This results in incorrect management decisions to increase
sales of short-run jobs and to reduce sales of long-run jobs, which results in
reduced profits as company resources are concentrated on the lowest-profit
products.

8-8 HOW DOES OVERHEAD ALLOCATION IMPACT
LOW-PROFIT PRODUCTS?

 

Traditional cost accounting dictates that overhead costs be assigned to every product.
By doing so, product margins will be reduced considerably. In some cases, margins
will likely become negative. Managers will then eliminate these products, under the


212 Management Accounting Best Practices

false assumption that the company is not earning a profit, and will be better off
without them. What actually happens is that no overhead costs are eliminated
along with the canceled products. Instead, the same pool of overhead costs must
now be spread over a smaller pool of remaining products, which increases the
allocated cost per product and makes the remaining products appear to be even
less profitable. This can lead to a continuous series of product eliminations that
leaves a company in a much less profitable situation than when it started
eliminating its low-margin products.

For example, Acorn Company has three products, whose margins are shown in the
following table. The company has $100,000 of overhead costs, which it allocates
based on the number of units sold. Acorn sells a combined total of 15,000 units of all
three of its products, so each one receives an overhead charge of $6.66 ($100,000
overhead expense/15,000 units):

 

Product Alpha Product Beta Product Charlie Totals

 

Units sold 1,500 3,500 10,000 15,000
Price each $8.00 $12.00 $15.00 —
Variable cost each 3.00 5.00 6.00 _
Overhead allocation 6.66 6.66 6.66 _
Gross margin each $(1.66) $0.34 $2.34 —
Gross margin total $(2,490) $1,190 $23,400 $22,100

 

Based on this analysis, Acorn elects to stop selling product Alpha, which has a
fully burdened loss of $2,490. The company does not lose any overhead expenses
as aresult of this product elimination, so the same $100,000 must now be allocated
among products Beta and Charlie, resulting in an increased overhead charge per
unit of $7.41 ($100,000 overhead expense/13,500 units). The results appear in the
following table:

 

 

Product Beta Product Charlie Totals
Units sold 3,500 10,000 13,500
Price each $12.00 $15.00 —
Variable cost each 5.00 6.00 _
Overhead allocation TAL TAL _
Gross margin each $0.41) $1.59 —
Gross margin total $(1,435) $15,900 $14,465

 

Now the product Beta margin has become negative, with a fully burdened loss of
$1,435. Acorn now stops selling product Beta. Overhead expenses do not decline as a
result of this product cancellation, so now the entire cost is allocated to product


8-9 How Do | Allocate Joint and Byproduct Costs? 213

Charlie, at a rate of $10.00 per unit ($100,000 overhead expense/10,000 units). The
result is shown in the following table:

 

Product Charlie

 

Units sold 10,000
Price each $15.00
Variable cost each 6.00
Overhead allocation 10.00
Gross margin each $(1.00)
Gross margin total $(10,000)

 

Based on the new cost allocation, Acorn cancels product Charlie as well, and now
finds itself out of business! Thus we have gone from a profitable company to a
bankrupt one, just because a fixed pool of overhead costs is being allocated to
individual products.

A better approach is to eliminate a product only if its price is lower than its
totally variable costs. Since these totally variable costs usually include only direct
materials, there will be very few circumstances where the product price will be
sufficiently low to warrant a product elimination. Instead, all products are kept if
they generate any positive margin at all, since this will contribute to the overall
margin being generated by the production system, allowing the company to pay
for its operating expenses.

Thus, a case can be made in favor of product elimination only in situations where a
specific amount of clearly defined operating expenses can be eliminated along with a
product.

8-9 HOW DO I ALLOCATE JOINT AND
BYPRODUCT COSTS?

 

To understand joint products and byproducts, one must have a firm understanding
of the split-off point. This is the last point in a production process where it is
impossible to determine the nature of the final products. All costs that have been
incurred by the production process up until that point—both direct and overhead—
must somehow be allocated to the products that result from the split-off point. Any
costs incurred thereafter can be charged to specific products in the normal manner.
Thus, a product that comes out of such a process will be composed of allocated costs
from before the split-off point and costs that can be directly traced to it, which occur
after the split-off point.

A related term is the byproduct, which is one or more additional products that arise
from a production process, but whose potential sales value is much smaller than that of
the principal joint products that arise from the same process. As we will see, the
accounting for byproducts can be somewhat different.


214 Management Accounting Best Practices

The logic used for allocating costs to joint products and byproducts has less
to do with some scientifically derived allocation method, and more with finding
a quick and easy way to allocate costs that is reasonably defensible (as we will see
in the next section). The reason for using simple methodologies is that the
promulgators of GAAP realize that there is no real management use for allocated
joint costs—they cannot be used for determining breakeven points, setting opti-
mal prices, or figuring out the exact profitability of individual products. Instead,
they are used for any of the following purposes, which are more administrative in
nature:

¢ Bonus calculations. Manager bonuses may depend on the level of reported
profits for specific products, which in turn are partly based on the level of joint
costs allocated to them. Thus, managers have a keen interest in the calculations
used to assign costs, especially if some of the joint costs can be dumped onto
products that are the responsibility of a different manager.

* Cost-plus contract calculations. Many government contracts are based on the
reimbursement of a company’s costs, plus some predetermined margin. In this
situation, it is in a company’s best interests to ensure that the largest possible
proportion of joint costs are assigned to any jobs that will be reimbursed by the
customer, while the customer will be equally interested, but due to a desire to
reduce the allocation of joint costs.

¢ Income reporting. Many organizations split their income statements into sub-
levels that report on profits by product line or even individual product. If so,
joint costs may make up such a large proportion of total production costs that
these income statements will not include the majority of production costs, unless
they are allocated to specific products or product lines.

¢ Insurance reimbursement. If a company suffers damage to its production or
inventory areas, some finished goods or work-in-process inventory may have
been damaged or destroyed. If so, it is in the interests of the company to fully
allocate as many joint costs as possible to the damaged or destroyed stock, so that
it can receive the largest possible reimbursement from its insurance provider.

¢ Inventory valuation. It is possible to manipulate inventory levels (and there-
fore the reported level of income) by shifting joint cost allocations toward those
products that are stored in inventory. This practice is obviously discouraged,
since it results in changes to income that have no relationship to operating
conditions. Nonetheless, one should be on the lookout for the deliberate use of
allocation methods that will alter the valuation of inventory.

¢ Transfer pricing. A company can alter the prices at which its sells products
among its various divisions, so that high prices are charged to those divisions
located in high-tax areas, resulting in lower reported levels of income tax against
which those high tax rates can be applied. A canny cost accounting staff will
choose the joint cost allocation technique that results in the highest joint costs


8-9 How Do | Allocate Joint and Byproduct Costs? 215

being assigned to products being sent to such locations (and the reverse for low-
tax regions).

There are only two methods for allocating joint and byproduct costs that have
gained widespread acceptance. The first is based on the sales value of all joint
products at the split-off point. To calculate it, compile all costs accumulated in the
production process up to the split-off point, determine the eventual sales value of
all products created at the split-off point, and then assign these costs to the products
based on their relative values. If there are byproducts associated with the joint
production process, they are considered to be too insignificant to be worthy of any
cost assignment, though revenues gained from their sale can be charged against the
cost of goods sold for the joint products. This is the simplest joint cost allocation
method, and particularly attractive, because the accountant needs no knowledge of
any production processing steps that occur after the split-off point.

This different treatment of the costs and revenues associated with byproducts
can lead to profitability anomalies at the product level. The trouble is that the
determination of whether a product is a byproduct or not can be quite judgmental; in
one company, if a joint product’s revenues are less than 10 percent of the total
revenues earned, then it is a byproduct, while another company might use a | percent
cutoff figure instead. Because of this vagueness in accounting terminology, one
company may assign all of its costs to just those joint products with an inordi-
nate share of total revenues, and record the value of all other products as zero. If a
large quantity of these byproducts were to be held in stock at a value of zero, the total
inventory valuation would be lower than another company would calculate, simply
due to their definition of what constitutes a byproduct.

A second problem with this cost allocation scenario is that byproducts may be sold
off only in batches, which may occur only once every few months. This can cause
sudden drops in the cost of joint products in the months when sales occur, since these
revenues will be subtracted from their cost. Alternatively, joint product costs will
appear to be too high in those periods when there are no byproduct sales. Thus, one can
alter product costs through the timing of byproduct sales.

A third problem related to byproducts is that the revenues realized from their sale
can vary considerably, based on market demand. If so, these altered revenues will
cause abrupt changes in the cost of those joint products against which these revenues
are netted. It certainly may require some explaining to show why changes in the price
of an unrelated product caused a change in the cost of a joint product!

The best way to avoid the three issues just noted is to avoid the designation of
any product as a byproduct. Instead, every joint product should be assigned some
proportion of total costs incurred up to the split-off point, based on their total potential
revenues (however small they may be), and no resulting revenues should be used to
offset other product costs. By avoiding the segregation of joint products into different
product categories, we can avoid a variety of costing anomalies.

The second allocation method is based on the estimated final gross margin of each
joint product produced. The calculation of gross margin is based on the revenue that

each product will earn at the end of the entire production process, less the cost of all
processing costs incurred from the split-off point to the point of sale. This is a more
complicated approach, since it requires the accountant to accumulate additional costs
through the end of the production process, which in turn requires a reasonable
knowledge of how the production process works, and where costs are incurred.
Though it is a more difficult method to calculate, its use may be mandatory in those
instances where the final sale price of one or more joint products cannot be determined
at the split-off point (as is required for the first allocation method), thereby rendering
the other allocation method useless.

The main problem with allocating joint costs based on the estimated final gross
margin is that it can be very difficult to calculate if there is a great deal of customized
work left between the split-off point and the point of sale. If so, it is impossible to
determine in advance the exact costs that will be incurred during the remaining
production process. In such a case, the only alternative is to make estimates of
expected costs that will be incurred, base the gross margin calculations on this
information, and accept the fact that the resulting joint cost allocations may not be
provable, based on the actual costs incurred.

Performance Responsibility
Accounting Decisions

A subtle issue that is completely overlooked by many accountants is the proper
structuring of the reports that they issue to various company employees. In addition to
the creation of a single, companywide set of financial statements, a considerable
amount of attention should be paid to the creation of an underlying set of reports that
target specific areas of responsibility, which may be at the levels of an entire division, a
department, or perhaps a single machine cell. When creating such reports, the
accountant may inquire about the nature of responsibility accounting, the types of
responsibility centers for which reports are created, and what types of costs should be
included or excluded from them. Ancillary issues involve whether a balanced
scorecard or a benchmarking system should be used; in both cases, the information
selected for inclusion in reports can have a significant impact on the resulting
performance of a company.

This chapter discusses the answers to all of these questions. The following table
itemizes the section number in which the answers to each question posed in this
chapter can be found:

9-1 WHAT IS RESPONSIBILITY ACCOUNTING?

 

A key task of the accountant is to create accounting systems that ensure that costs are
incurred in accordance with expectations. The best way to do so is through the concept
of responsibility accounting, which is the assumption that every cost incurred must be
the responsibility of one person somewhere in the company. For example, the cost of
rent can be assigned to the person who negotiates and signs the lease, while the cost of
an employee’s salary is the responsibility of that person’s direct manager. This
concept also applies to the cost of products, for each component part has a standard
cost (as listed in the item master and bill of materials), which it is the responsibility of

217


218 Management Accounting Best Practices

the purchasing manager to obtain at the correct price. Similarly, scrap costs incurred at
a machine are the responsibility of the shift manager.

By using this approach, cost reports can be tailored for each recipient. For
example, the manager of a work cell will receive a financial statement that itemizes
only the costs incurred by that specific cell, whereas the production manager will
receive a different one that itemizes the costs of the entire production department, and
the president will receive one that summarizes the results of the entire organization.

As one moves upward through the organizational structure, it is common to find
fewer responsibility reports being used. For example, each person in a department
may be placed in charge of a separate cost, and so each one receives a report that
itemizes his or her performance in controlling that cost. However, when the more
complex profit center approach is used, these costs are typically clumped together into
the group of costs that can be directly associated with revenues from a specific product
or product line, which therefore results in fewer profit centers than cost centers. Then,
at the highest level of responsibility center, that of the investment center, one must
make investments that may cut across entire product lines, so that the investment
center tends to be reported at a minimal level of an entire production facility. Thus,
there is a natural consolidation in the number of responsibility reports generated by
the accounting department as more complex forms of responsibility reporting are
used.

9-2 WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF RESPONSIBILITY
CENTERS?

 

The most elementary form of responsibility center is the cost center, which itemizes
all of the expenses incurred to run a specified function, but ignores the cost of
capital invested in it, as well as any associated revenues. The primary form of
control in a cost center is against a fixed or semivariable budget that is determined
at the beginning of the year. It is not common to see a variable budget being used
ina cost center, since purely variable costs tend to be most closely associated with
production, for which there are associated sales; this relationship means that
variable budget costs are more commonly found in profit centers than in cost
centers. An example of the cost center reporting format is shown in Exhibit 9.1,
where we see all the expense line items for the janitorial department listed. There
is also a subtotal for those costs that are directly attributable to the department,
followed by an overhead allocation for administrative costs (which is not
controllable by the janitorial manager). This general format can be used for
any cost center.

Though this is a good start for a company that wants to implement controls over its
expenditures, it suffers from one main flaw—those responsible for cost centers are
concerned only with the tight control of costs, rather than other key company goals,
such as customer service, creating new products, or acquiring new customers. This
can lead to counterproductive behavior. For example, the manager of the computer

services department, which is operated as a cost center, is determined to avoid any cost
overruns. The sales manager, who is trying to increase profits, asks that a customized
report be created that lists the margins for each existing customer, so that the sales
team will know which customers are the best ones to sell to. However, the computer
services manager refuses this request, for it will result in extra costs that will exceed
her budget. This problem occurs regularly when a company is structured into many
cost centers, each of which looks out for its own self-interest.

As the name implies, a revenue center is one where the employees located in a
specific functional area are solely responsible for attaining preset revenue levels. The
sales department is sometimes considered to be a revenue center. In this capacity,
employees are essentially encouraged to obtain new sales without regard to the cost of
obtaining them. This can be a dangerous way to run a function, unless strict guidelines
are set up that control the overall spending limits allowed, the size and type of
customer solicited, and the size and type of orders obtained. Otherwise, the sales staff
will obtain orders from all kinds of customers, including those with poor credit records
or histories of returning goods, not to mention orders that are so small that the cost of
processing the order exceeds the profit gained from the sale. Other counterproductive
activities associated with revenue centers are the inordinate use of travel funds to meet
with customers, selling products at large discounts from the standard price, offering
special promotional guarantees to customers, allowing credits on previously pur-
chased products if the price subsequently declines, and offering to extend payment
terms. For all of these reasons, revenue centers are not recommended without the
addition of stringent controls to ensure that the sales staff obtains only revenues that
will result in adequate levels of profitability.

The profit center resolves many of the problems just noted for the cost and revenue
center concepts by combining the two. The manager of a profit center is primarily
responsible for generating the highest possible profit (or least possible loss). This
results in a strong incentive to pursue only those sales that have a sufficient margin,
while also incurring expenses only if they will result in an incremental increase
in revenue. An example of a profit center report is shown in Exhibit 9.2. This for-
mat is very similar to the one used for a cost center, except that it now includes a
revenue line at the top and a profit amount at the bottom.

The profit center concept is highly recommended, since it results in the
strongest possible management attention to profitability. However, there are
some cases where it is difficult to convert a cost center to a profit center, because
there is no way for it to gain revenues by directly selling its services. Examples of
such cost centers are the computer services, engineering, and production depart-
ments. These groups are all involved in the production or support of products, but
it can be difficult to attribute sales directly to them. One way around this problem
is to have each department charge other departments for its services. A good
example is the computer services function, where many organizations create a
programming cost per hour that is charged to all other departments that request
changes to computer programs; it is also common to charge for the processing time
used by each department’s programs, as well as the cost of report processing,
generation, and distribution. These are valid charges to make, for departments now
have the option of outsourcing some functions, such as computer services, so that
suppliers provide the same services that have previously been performed intern-
ally. If a department can find a better deal outside of the company, then it should go
ahead and purchase the outside services. By using this approach, a company can
force many of its cost centers to pay a much greater level of attention to their costs
incurred and services rendered to other departments—if they drop below the level
of outside service providers, then there will be no call for their services, and the
employees in those departments will lose their jobs. This approach can be used for
many functions besides computer services, such as engineering, production, and
accounting.

When determining revenues for profit centers, it may be necessary to allo-
cate revenues based on the cost of services or materials added to a product
as it moves through a department. If there are cases where it becomes difficult
to justify a revenue allocation, or it is impossible to prove that any value is
added to a product or service, then it may be better to leave the function as a cost
center.


9-3 Should Allocated Costs Be Included in Responsibility Reports? 221

A step beyond the profit center in its level of sophistication is the investment
center. This is the same as a profit center, but now the responsible manager is also held
accountable for any investments in the business. This added responsibility means that
one additional measure is added to the normal set of measures used for a profit center:
return on investment. This measures the ability of a manager not only to generate a
profit, but to also create one at a sufficiently high level to offset the cost of capital on
any newly invested funds.

The investment center is particularly appropriate for those cases where investment
decisions must be made very rapidly in order to take advantage of changes in local
business conditions. This is a particularly important issue for those companies in
rapidly expanding markets, or where consumer needs change rapidly, where waiting
for investment approval from a central authority may result in lost sales.

Though the investment center seems like the most sophisticated of all the various
types of responsibility accounting, given its incorporation of revenues, costs, and
invested funds, it is a rarely used format. The reason is that the manager of an
investment center could obligate a corporation into a very large investment, and never
generate a sufficient return to pay off the investment, thereby worsening the financial
condition of the corporation as a whole. This problem can be restricted by adding
some form of investment oversight. For example, an investment committee at the
corporate headquarters or division level can be used to approve all investments over a
certain amount. This approach gives the managers of investment centers total leeway
to invest smaller amounts of money, while still reducing the overall corporate risk of a
bad investment by requiring a more detailed analysis for large investments.

Investment centers function less efficiently when there is a highly centralized
corporate management structure in place. In this instance, very few decisions are left
for the local manager, and certainly not investment-related decisions, which are
strictly controlled by a central capital investment review function.

The alternative corporate structure, that of decentralization, nearly requires the
use of investment centers, since the corporate management staff goes out of its way not
to become involved in operational issues at the local facility level. Thus, the overall
management structure is a strong driver of the level of usage of investment centers.

9-3 SHOULD ALLOCATED COSTS BE INCLUDED IN
RESPONSIBILITY REPORTS?

 

A common costing scenario is when responsibility reports include a variety of
corporate or local overhead costs. The person who is responsible for the operating
results of each department or division has virtually no control over the incurrence of
these overhead costs, and so can make a reasonable argument against being judged on
this number. The simplest way to avoid this issue is to restructure the responsibility
financial statements by subtotaling all other financial results prior to adding in
allocated costs. This approach keeps actual operating results from being obscured
by allocated costs.


222 Management Accounting Best Practices

The decision to include or exclude an allocated cost from a responsibility report
can be made by subjecting the cost to two rules. First, if a local manager has no direct
ability to control a cost, then it should be excluded from that manager’s responsibility
reports. Second, if the cost would remain if the responsibility center were to be
completely eliminated, then the cost should also be excluded from the same reports.
For example, corporate overhead generally should not be allocated to any respon-
sibility centers, because the corporate overhead costs would still exist even if the
responsibility centers were eliminated.

9-4 WHAT IS BALANCED SCORECARD REPORTING?

 

Too often, a company focuses exclusively on its financial results. By doing so, it may
be forcing attention away from other key measures that ultimately have a strong
impact on financial performance and that enhance that performance in the long run. To
counteract this problem, consider using the balanced scorecard. Under this approach,
a company’s key performance measurements are split into four areas, which are
the financial, customer, internal business processes, and learning and growth areas.
These areas are designed to build on each other, so that a proper level of attention to the
three nonfinancial measurement areas will result in an improved set of financial
measurements as well.

An example of this measurement system is shown in Exhibit 9.3. In it, we see that
the learning and growth measurements, shown in the lower left-hand corner, are
designed to improve the performance of employees through training as well as
reduced turnover (on the grounds that fewer employee departures results in fewer new
employees, hence a more experienced staff). Measurements for the last month are
compared with those from previous periods, so that employees can see trends in the
measurements. Success in the learning and growth area should result in an improve-
ment in the company’s internal business processes, which are itemized in the lower-
right corner of the example. In this area, increased employee training has led to
improved processing time for customer orders as well as the near-completion of a just-
in-time manufacturing system. These process changes should result in improved
customer-related measurements, which are noted in the upper-right corner. With
improved product quality, on-time shipments, and customer satisfaction, we assume
that financial performance will improve, which will be reflected in the final box in the
upper-left corner. In this area, the financial measures are closely tied to the corporate
goal, which is listed at the top of the page—that of spinning off enough cash from
operations to fund new facilities and acquire competitors. Thus, the balanced
scorecard reporting system results in a coherent set of interlocking measurements
that are directly tied to a company’s goals.

The balanced scorecard must be individualized for each company that uses it,
since each one operates within a unique set of constraints. The measurements used in
the example are designed for a manufacturing facility, and so would be inappropriate
for use by a service company. To obtain the correct set of measurements for a balanced

scorecard, a company’s senior management group should compile a short list of the
most appropriate measures, possibly with the assistance of a trained facilitator who
can keep the discussion on track. Once everyone has agreed on the most appropriate
measures, there must be further agreement on how each one shall be calculated, as
well as when the measures shall be sent back to the management team for periodic
review. These up-front decisions will ensure that the correct measures are calculated
and that they will be used by managers to improve the business.


224 Management Accounting Best Practices

The balanced scorecard should not supplant all previous measurement systems
that a company uses to track its performance. There may be dozens or even hundreds
of measures already in place that are extremely useful for the conduct of daily
operations and that should be continued. The balanced scorecard is more for the use of
the management group, which can use it to see how well they are directing the
company’s performance in reaching its major goals. To this end, it should be treated as
a high-level set of measurements, under which lie a great many other measures that
must be still be used to transact daily company business.

9-5 HOW DOES BENCHMARKING WORK?

 

Benchmarking is the process of obtaining and productively using information about
how to improve one’s processes, products, and strategies. It is a systematic process,
rather than one that is only occasionally engaged in; this requires the ongoing use of
project teams that are continually renewed with well-trained employees from all parts
of an organization, and who are adequately supported at the uppermost levels of the
company.

There are three types of benchmarking that one can perform, each of which is
targeted at a different part of a company’s operations. The first is benchmarking for
internal processes. Comparisons can be made with companies from markedly different
industries, since processes are readily adaptable across many industries. When one
hears about how a company has conducted a benchmarking review with another
company that is far outside of its normal field of competitors, it is most likely that the
study addressed process changes. When processes are the subject of benchmarking,
the usual justification is that there will be immediate financial results, typically through
the elimination of employee positions. It can also achieve shorter processing intervals,
which is readily measured. For these reasons, process benchmarking is very popular.

Another type of benchmarking is based on products or services. It uses compar-
isons between a company’s own products or services and those of other organizations.
The focus of such a study tends to be on the quality, reliability, and features of
comparable products. This does not mean that benchmarking comparisons are
confined to products created by companies in the same industry, since products
may be broken down into their component parts, which may individually be more
readily comparable with products from other industries. Product benchmarking can
be performed without the approval of any other company, since one can simply buy
their products and directly review them, either through reverse engineering or feature
comparisons. Nonetheless, it is most useful to obtain the cooperation of the maker of
each product, since the review team could glean much additional information
regarding the manner in which each product was manufactured, information that
is not readily apparent from a direct review of the product itself.

The final form of benchmarking is strategic; the review team wishes to discern
whether there are other ways to position the company within its industry that it has
not considered, but which other organizations are implementing with success. This


9-5 How Does Benchmarking Work? 225

usually requires a close look at other industries, since the industry within which a
company competes may be chock-full of organizations that all have the same strategic
mindset, and which therefore are not good sources of information. This type of review
tends not to yield much in the way of short-term improvements, since strategic
changes typically require several years of effort to implement. Thus, only the most
forward-looking management teams tend to engage in this type of benchmarking,
however useful it may prove to be in the long run.

How does one conduct a benchmarking study? The initial step is to decide exactly
what to benchmark. Though there should already be some general idea of what is to be
done, the topic initially presented may have been a broad one, within which several
more specific projects could be fitted. For example, the initial proposal may have been
to shorten the cycle time of the disbursements business process. However, there are a
number of steps within this process, such as ordering and receiving goods, forwarding
the paperwork to accounting, matching accounts payable documentation, and issuing
payment. The project team may select only one of these subprocesses for a more
detailed review.

Once the specific subprocess has been selected, the project team can collect
information about the performance level of whatever is targeted. This information is
needed in order to compare it with the results gained from a review of outside entities
or other departments or divisions of the same company. For example, a review of a
process might require a workflow diagram that details exactly how information flows
through it, as well as the various control points and time requirements at each step in
the process. Alternatively, a review of an existing product would require an analysis of
its cost, as well as a complete description of its various features and level of quality.

The next step is to determine what companies to benchmark. There are a variety of
ways to make a list of benchmarking targets. One is to review professional publica-
tions to see which ones are improving themselves in specific areas; another is to
review general or industry-specific publications for the same information. Another
source is speeches at industry symposiums. Yet another source may be networking
connections between companies. If there are many company divisions, then yet
another source is to call one’s counterparts in those divisions.

Once a set of benchmarking targets have been selected, the project team must
create a set of questions to ask the representatives of the companies with whom they
will meet. This is a very important step, since the target companies are setting aside
valuable time to meet with the team, and should not have their time wasted. To this
end, the team should first create the largest possible list of questions, and then whittle
it down to the most critical questions that can be definitely handled during the assigned
meeting time with the target company. There should also be a secondary list of follow-
up questions that can be used if there is still time available after the primary questions
have been answered.

The completed review should give rise to a number of action items that can be used
to either modify or (more rarely) replace the internal process, product, or strategy.
However, before implementing any changes, this is a good time to interact with the
personnel who will be impacted by them. The reason for doing so is that the person


226 Management Accounting Best Practices

who will use the modification may be aware of internal problems that the project team
is not aware of, and which will make the change inoperable.

With these preparations completed, the team should create a thorough imple-
mentation plan that describes the precise changes, when they will take place, what
they will impact, and who will be responsible for them, not to mention any required
training, capital purchases, or personnel changes. This plan should be carefully
reviewed to ensure that nothing is missing, and that the timelines are reasonable.

A final step is to schedule a review of all changes after some time has passed during
which the changes have had a chance to settle in and either succeed or fail. If they have
failed, then the team must review the situation and recommend changes to the
management team in regard to what further steps must now be taken. If the changes
have been a success, then the benefits should be quantified and forwarded to the
financial analyst who is reviewing the project, so that the management team can be
informed of the return on investment of its benchmarking initiative.

Product Design Decisions

The involvement of accountants with products is usually limited to the calculation
of their costs for inventory costing purposes. Though this limited recordation role
is useful, the accountant should become deeply involved in both the allocation of
funding to new products and the analysis of costs during the product development
process. The reason for this additional work is that approximately 90 percent of
the cost of a product is designed into it, and cannot thereafter be altered; conse-
quently, the accountant can have a huge impact on acompany’s cost of goods sold by
actively providing cost accounting information to product design teams during
the development process.

The key tool used to design lower costs into products is called target costing.
The accountant needs to know how target costing works, how it impacts profit-
ability, what data is needed for proper target costing analysis, how it can be
incorporated into the budgeting process, and related issues. The following table
itemizes the section number in which the answers to each question posed in this
chapter can be found:

10-1 HOW DO | MAKE FUNDING DECISIONS FOR
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS?

 

When allocating funding to research and development (R&D) projects, the traditional
approach is to require all R&D proposals to pass a minimum return-on-investment
hurdle rate. However, when there is limited funding available and too many invest-
ments passing the hurdle rate to all be funded, managers tend to pick the most likely
projects to succeed. This selection process usually results in the least risky projects

227


228 Management Accounting Best Practices

being funded, which are typically extensions of existing product lines or other
variations on existing products that will not achieve breakthrough profitability. An
alternative that is more likely to achieve a higher return on R&D investment is
to apportion investable funds into multiple categories—a large percentage that is only
to be used for highly risky projects with associated high returns, and a separate pool
of funds specifically designated for lower-risk projects with correspondingly lower
levels of return. The exact proportions of funding allocated to each category will
depend on management’s capacity for risk, as well as the size and number of avail-
able projects in each category. This approach allows a company the opportunity to
achieve a breakthrough product introduction that it would probably not have funded if
a single hurdle rate had been used to evaluate new product proposals.

If this higher-risk approach to allocating funds is used, it is likely that a number of
new product projects will be abandoned prior to their release into the market, on
the grounds that they will not yield a sufficient return on investment or will not be
technologically or commercially feasible. This is not a bad situation, since some
projects are bound to fail if a sufficiently high level of project risk is acceptable to
management. Conversely, if no projects fail, this is a clear sign that management is not
investing in sufficiently risky investments. To measure the level of project failure,
calculate R&D waste, which is the amount of unrealized product development
spending (e.g., the total expenditure on canceled projects during the measurement
period). Even better, divide the amount of R&D waste by the total R&D expenditure
during the period to determine the proportion of expenses incurred on failed projects.
Unfortunately, this measure can be easily manipulated by accelerating or withholding
the declaration of project termination. Nonetheless, it does give a fair indication of
project risk when aggregated over the long term.

Though funding may be allocated into broad investment categories, manage-
ment must still use a reliable method for determining which projects will receive
funding and which will not. The standard approach is to apply a discount rate to all
possible projects, and then to select those having the highest net present value
(NPV). However, the NPV calculation does not include several key variables found
in the expected commercial value (ECV) formula, making the ECV the preferred
method. The ECV formula requires one to multiply a prospective project’s net pre-
sent value by the probability of its commercial success, minus the commercializa-
tion cost, and then multiply the result by the probability of technical success,
minus the development cost. Thus, the intent of using ECV is to include all major
success factors into the decision to accept or reject a new product proposal. The
formula is as follows:

(((Project net present value x Probability of commercial success)
— Commercialization cost) x (Probability of technical success))
— Product development cost

As an example of the use of ECV, the Moravia Corporation collects the following
information about a new project for a battery-powered lawn trimmer, where there is


10-2 How Does Target Costing Work? 229

some technical risk that a sufficiently powerful battery cannot be developed for the
product:

 

Project net present value $4,000,000
Probability of commercial success 90%
Commercialization cost $750,000
Probability of technical success 65%
Product development cost $1,750,000

 

Based on this information, Moravia computes the following ECV for the lawn
trimmer project:

((($4,000,000 Project net present value x 90% Probability of commercial success)
—$750,000 Commercialization cost) x (65% Probability of technical success))
—$1,750,000 Product development cost

Expected commercial value = $102,500

Even if some projects are dropped after being run through the preceding valuation
analysis, this does not mean that they should be canceled for good. On the contrary,
these projects may become commercially viable over time, depending on changes in
price points, costs, market conditions, and technical viability. Consequently, the R&D
manager should conduct a periodic review of previously shelved projects to see
whether any of the factors just noted have changed sufficiently to allow the company
to reintroduce a project proposal for development.

10-2 HOW DOES TARGET COSTING WORK?

 

The concept behind target costing is based on the realization that the bulk of all product
costs are predetermined before a product ever reaches the production floor. This is
because the types of materials used are determined during the design stage, as are the
types of production methods used to shape and assemble the parts into a completed
product. Consequently, the cost-reduction focus of any company that designs its own
products should be to closely review the costs of products while they are still in the
design stage, and do everything possible to keep those costs to a minimum.

The target costing methodology addresses the costs that are designed into a
product with a four-step process:

Phase 1: Conduct Market Research. This involves reviewing the competitive land-
scape to see what other products are in the marketplace, as well as the types of
new products that competitors say they are about to release into the market. This
also involves a review of which customers may buy future products, what needs
they have, and what prices they are likely to pay for selected features on these
products. Further, always determine the size of the market in which the new


230 Management Accounting Best Practices

products are to be released, and the amount of market share that can likely be
obtained. This gives a company the general outlines of a revenue plan, in terms of
the probable number of units that can be sold and the price at which they would sell.

Phase 2: Determine Margin and Cost Feasibility. This involves clarifying what
customers want for product features, based on the information gathered in
the first step, and translating this into a preliminary set of product features
that will go into the anticipated product design. Then determine a price point,
again based on the preceding market research, at which the product is likely
to sell. Then determine the standard margin to be applied to the product (which is
commonly based on the corporate cost of capital, plus an additional percentage),
which results in a cost figure that the product cannot exceed. Finally, conduct a
preliminary review of anticipated product costs to see if the product design is in
the cost ballpark. If not, cancel the design project as being unfeasible.

Phase 3: Meet Margin Targets through Design Improvements. This involves the
completion of all value engineering needed to drive down the product’s cost to
the level at which the target price and margin can be attained, as well as con-
firming the viability of the material and process costs with suppliers and other
parts of the company that are impacted by these design decisions. The design is
then finalized, and the resulting bill of materials is sent to the purchasing staff for
procurement, while the industrial engineering staff proceeds with the installation
of all required changes to the production facility that are needed to implement
lower-cost production processes.

Phase 4: Implement Continuous Improvement. This involves the product launch in
the manufacturing facility, first through a pilot production run, and then as a
launch at full production volumes. Also, the accountant begins the regular review
of all supplier costs that contribute to the cost of the product, and reports on
variances to management, to ensure that targeted cost levels will be maintained
subsequent to the design phase.

These target costing steps are shown graphically in Exhibit 10.1.

10-3 WHAT IS VALUE ENGINEERING?

 

A concept called value engineering was noted in phase 2 of the preceding target
costing steps. This is the collective term for a number of activities that are used to
lower the cost of a product. Here are some of the issues that are dealt with during a
value engineering review:

* Can we eliminate functions from the production process? This involves
a detailed review of the entire manufacturing process to see whether there are
any steps, such as interim quality reviews, that add no value to the product. By
eliminating them it is possible to take their associated direct or overhead costs
out of the product cost. However, these functions were originally put in for a

reason, so the engineering team must be careful to develop workaround steps that
eliminate the need for the original functions.

* Can we eliminate some durability or reliability? It is quite possible to design an
excessive degree of sturdiness into a product. For example, a vacuum cleaner
can be designed to withstand a one-ton impact, whereas there is only the
most vanishing chance that such an impact will ever occur; designing it to
withstand an impact of 100 pounds may account for 99.999 percent of all
probable impacts, while also eliminating a great deal of structural materials
from the design. However, this concept can be taken too far, resulting in a
visible reduction in durability or reliability, so any designs that have had their
structural integrity reduced must be thoroughly tested to ensure that they meet
all design standards.

* Can we minimize the design? This involves the creation of a design that uses
fewer parts or has fewer features. This approach is based on the assump-
tion that a minimal design is easier to manufacture and assemble. Also,
with fewer parts to purchase, there is less procurement overhead associa-
ted with the product. However, reducing a product to extremes, perhaps
from dozens of components to just a few molded or prefabricated parts, can
result in excessively high costs for those few remaining parts, since they may
be so complex or custom-made in nature that it would be less expensive
to settle for a few extra standard parts that are more easily and cheaply
obtained.

* Can we design the product better for the manufacturing process? Also known as
design for manufacture and assembly (DFMA), this involves the creation of a
product design that can be created only in a specific manner. For example, a toner
cartridge for a laser printer is designed so that it can be successfully inserted into
the printer only when the correct sides of the cartridge are correctly aligned with
the printer opening; all other attempts to insert the cartridge will fail. When used
for the assembly of an entire product, this approach ensures that a product will not
be incorrectly manufactured or assembled, which would otherwise call for a
costly disassembly, or (even worse) product recalls from customers who have
already received defective goods.

* Can we substitute parts? This approach encourages the search for less expensive
components or materials that can replace more expensive parts that are currently
used in a product design. This is an increasingly valid approach, since new
materials are being developed every year. However, sometimes the use of a
different material will impact the types of materials that can be used elsewhere in
a product, which may result in cost increases in those other areas, for a net
increase in costs. Thus, any parts substitution must be accompanied by a review
of related changes elsewhere in the design. This step is also known as component
parts analysis, which involves one extra activity—that of tracking the intentions
of suppliers to continue producing parts in the future; if not, the affected parts
must be eliminated from the product design.


10-4 How Does Target Costing Impact Profitability? 233

* Can we combine steps? A detailed review of all processes associated with a
product will sometimes reveal that some steps can be consolidated, which may
mean that one is eliminated (as noted earlier), or that steps can be combined with
one person, rather than having people in widely disparate parts of the production
process perform them. This is also known as process centering. By combining
steps in this manner, it is possible to eliminate some of the transfer and queue time
from the production process, which in turn also reduces the chance that parts will
be damaged during those transfers.

¢ Is there a better way? Though this step sounds awfully vague, it really strikes at
the core of the cost-reduction issue—the other value engineering steps previously
noted are ones that focus on incremental improvements to the existing design or
production process, whereas this one is a more general attempt to start from
scratch and build a new product or process that is not based in any way on
preexisting ideas. Improvements resulting from this step tend to have the largest
favorable impact on cost reductions, but also can be the most difficult for the
organization to adopt, especially if it has used other designs or systems for the
production of earlier models.

Another approach to value engineering is to call upon the services of the
company’s suppliers to assist in the cost-reduction effort. These organizations are
particularly suited to the contribution of information concerning enhanced types of
technology or materials, since they may specialize in such areas that a company has no
information about. They may have also conducted extensive value engineering for the
components that they manufacture, resulting in advanced designs that a company may
be able to incorporate into its new products. Suppliers may have also redesigned their
production processes, or can be assisted by a company’s engineers to do so, resulting
in cost reductions or reduced production waste that can be translated into lower
component costs for a company.

A mix of all the value engineering steps noted above must be applied to each
product design to ensure that the maximum permissible cost will be safely reached.
Also, even if a minimal amount of value engineering is needed to reach a cost goal,
one should conduct the full range of value engineering analysis anyway, since this
can result in further cost reductions that will either improve the margin of the
product or allow management the option to reduce the product’s price, thereby
causing havoc for competitors who sell higher-priced products.

10-4 HOW DOES TARGET COSTING IMPACT
PROFITABILITY?

 

Target costing can have a startlingly large positive impact on profitability, depend-
ing on the commitment of management to its use, the constant involvement of
accountants in all phases of a product’s life cycle, and the type of strategy that a
company follows.


234 Management Accounting Best Practices

Target costing improves profitability in two ways. One is that because it
places such a detailed and continuing emphasis on product costs throughout the
life cycle of every product, it is very unlikely that a company will experience run-
away costs; also, the management team will be completely aware of costing issues,
since it receives regular reports pertaining to costs from the cost accounting
members of all design teams. The second way in which it improves profitability
is through the precise targeting of the correct prices at which the company feels
it can field a profitable product in the marketplace that will sell in a robust manner.
This is opposed to the more common cost-plus approach, under which a company
builds a product, then determines its cost, tacks on a profit, and then does not
understand why its resoundingly high price does not attract any buyers. Thus, target
costing results in not only better cost control, but also better price control.

Target costing is really part of a larger concept called concurrent engineering,
which requires participants from many departments to work together in project teams,
rather than having separate departments handle new product designs only after they
have been handed off from the preceding department in the design chain. Clustering
representatives from many departments together in a single design team can be quite a
struggle, especially for older companies that have a history of conflict between
departments. Consequently, only the most involved and prolonged support by all
members of the senior management group will ensure that target costing, and the
greater concept of concurrent engineering, will result in significant profitability
improvements.

The review of product costs under the target costing methodology is not
reserved for just the period up to the completion of design work on a new product.
On the contrary, there are always opportunities to control costs after the design
phase is completed, though the opportunities are smaller than during the design
phase. Accordingly, accountants should not be pulled from a design team once the
final drawings have left the engineering department. Instead, the accountants
should regularly monitor actual component costs and compare them against
planned costs, warning management whenever significant adverse variances arise.
Also, they should take a lead role in the continuing review of supplier costs to see
whether these can be reduced, perhaps by visiting supplier facilities, as well as
constantly reviewing existing product designs to see whether they can be improved,
and by targeting waste or spoilage on the production floor for elimination. There-
fore, the accounting staff must be involved in all phases of a product’s life cycle if a
company is to realize the fullest extent of profitability improvements from target
costing.

An issue that can get in the way of profitability is a company’s type of strategy.
If it is constantly issuing a stream of new products, or if it’s existing product line is
subject to severe pricing pressure, then it must make target costing a central part of
its strategy, so that the correct price points are used for products and actual costs
match those that were originally planned. However, there are other strategies, such
as growth by geographical expansion of the current product line (as is practiced by
retail stores), or growth by acquisition, where there is no particular need for target


10-5 Are There Any Problems with Target Costing? 235

costing—these companies make their money in other ways than by a focused
concentration on product features and costs. For them, there may still be a limited
role for target costing, but it will be severely bounded by the reduced need for new
products.

10-5 ARE THERE ANY PROBLEMS WITH TARGET
COSTING?

 

Though the target costing system results in clear and substantial benefits in most
cases, there are a few problems with it that one should be aware of, and guard
against.

The first problem is that the development process can be lengthened to a
considerable extent, since the design team may require a number of design
iterations before it can devise a sufficiently low-cost product that will meet the
target cost and margin criteria. This occurrence is most common when the project
manager is unwilling to pull the plug on a design project that cannot meet its cost-
ing goals within a reasonable time frame. Usually, if there is no evidence of rapid
progress toward a specific target cost within a relatively short time frame, then it
is better to either ditch the project or at least shelve it for a short time and then try
again, on the assumption that new cost-reduction methods or less-expensive
materials will be available in the near future that will make the target cost an
achievable one.

Another problem is that a great deal of mandatory cost cutting can result in finger
pointing between various parts of the company, especially if employees in one area
feel that they are being called on to provide a disproportionately large part of the
savings. For example, the industrial engineering staff will not be happy if it is required
to completely alter the production layout in order to generate cost savings, while the
purchasing staff is not required to make any cost reductions through supplier
negotiations. Avoiding this problem requires strong interpersonal and negotiation
skills on the part of the project manager.

Finally, having representatives from a number of departments on the design team
can sometimes make it more difficult to reach consensus on the proper design, because
there are too many opinions on the team regarding design issues. This is a particular
problem if there are particularly stubborn people on the design team who are holding
out for specific product features. Resolving this problem requires a strong team
manager, as well as a long-term commitment on the part of a company to weed out
those people from design teams who are not willing to act in the best interests of the
team.

For every problem area outlined here, the dominant solution is that of retaining
strong control over the design teams, which calls for a good team leader. This
person must have an exceptional knowledge of the design process, good inter-
personal skills, and a commitment to attaining both time and cost budgets for a
design project.


236 Management Accounting Best Practices

10-6 WHAT IS THE ACCOUNTANT’S ROLE INA
TARGET COSTING ENVIRONMENT?

 

Given the strong cost orientation in a target costing environment, there is obviously a
considerable role for the accountant on a design team. What are the specific activities
and required skills of this person?

The accountant should be able to provide for the other members of the design team
a running series of cost estimates that are based on initial design sketches, activity-
based costing reviews of production processes, and best-guess costing information
from suppliers, based on estimated production volumes. Especially at the earliest
stages of a design, the accountant will be working with vague cost information, and so
must be able to provide estimates that are within a high-low range of costs, gradually
tightening this estimated cost range as more information becomes available.

The accountant should also be responsible for any capital budgeting requests
generated by the design team, since he or she has the most knowledge of the capital
budgeting process, how to fill out required forms, and precisely what types of
equipment are needed for the anticipated product design. The accountant also
becomes the key contact on the design team for any questions from the finance staff
regarding issues or uncertainties in the capital budgeting proposal.

The accountant should work with the design team to help it understand the nature
of various costs (such as cost allocations based on an activity-based costing system),
as well as the cost/benefit trade-offs of using various design or cost options in the new
product.

In addition, the accountant is responsible for tracking the gap between the current
cost of a product design and the target cost that is the design team’s goal, which should
include an itemization of where cost savings have already been achieved and in what
areas of the product there has not been a sufficient degree of progress.

Finally, the accountant must continue to compare a product’s actual cost against
the target cost after the design is complete, and for as long as the company is selling the
product. This is a very necessary step, because management must know immediately
if costs are increasing beyond budgeted levels and why those increases are occurring.

Given the large number of activities for which an accountant is responsible under
the target costing methodology, it is evident that the job is a full-time one for all but the
smallest costing projects. Accordingly, an accountant will commonly be sent to a
design team as a long-term assignment, and may even report to the design team’s
manager, with no or few ties back to the accounting department. This may even be a
different career track for an accountant, being permanently attached to a series of
design teams.

There are very particular qualifications that an accountant must have before being
assigned to a target costing team. One is certainly having a good knowledge of
company products, as well as their features and components. Also, the accountant
must know how to create an activity-based costing system to evaluate related
production costs, or at least interpret such costing data that has been developed
by someone else. Further, this person must work well in a team environment,


10-7 What Data is Needed for a Target Costing Analysis? 237

proactively assisting other members of the team in constantly evaluating the costs of
new design concepts. Further, the person should have good analysis and presentation
skills, since the ongoing costing results must be continually presented not only to
other members of the team, but also to the members of the milestone review
committee. Accordingly, the best accountant for this position is an outgoing one
with some years of experience within a company or industry.

10-7 WHAT DATA IS NEEDED FOR A TARGET
COSTING ANALYSIS?

 

The typical accountant is used to extracting data from a central accounting database
that has been carefully stocked with the most accurate and reliable data, from such a
variety of sources as accounts payable, billings, bills of material, and inventory
records. However, the accountant who is assigned to a target costing project must deal
with much more poorly defined information, as well as data that is drawn from much
different sources than he or she may be accustomed to using.

In the earliest stages of a product design, the accountant must make the best
possible guesses regarding the costs of proposed designs. Information about these
costs can be garnered through the careful review of possible component parts, as
well as comparison with the cost of existing products that bear some similarity to the
designs now under review. No matter what the method, it will result in relatively
rough cost estimates, especially during the earliest stages of a new product’s
development. To operate in this environment takes an accountant with a wide-
ranging view of costing systems and the willingness to start with rough estimates
and gradually polish them into more concrete information as designs gradually
solidify. Accordingly, accountants with a narrow focus should not be allowed on a
product design team.

Though cost estimates will be admittedly rough in the earliest stages of a new
product design, it is possible to include with the best estimate an additional estimate of
the highest possible cost that will be experienced. This additional information lets
management know whether there is a significant degree of risk that the project may not
be able to achieve its desired cost target. Though this information can result in the
outright termination of a project, it is much more common for senior management to
interview the project director in some detail to gain a better understanding of the
variables underlying an excessively high cost estimate, as well as the chances that
those costs can be reduced back to within the targeted levels. Only after obtaining this
additional information should a company make the decision to cancel a product
design project.

There are also new sources of data that an accountant can access. One is
competitor information, which is collected by the marketing staff or an outside
research agency. This database contains information about the prices at which
competitors are selling their products, as well as the prices of ancillary products,
and perhaps also the discounts given at various price points. It can also include market


238 Management Accounting Best Practices

share data for individual products or by firm, as well as the opinions of customers
regarding the offerings of various companies and the financial condition of compe-
titors. This information is mostly used to determine the range of price points at whicha
company should sell its existing or anticipated products, as well as the features that
should be included at each price point. The extra information about the financial
condition and market shares of competitors may also be of use, since a company can
elect to alter the pricing of its products if this will lead to a better market position
against them. This database is of great value to the accountant in determining the price
at which products should be released to the market.

Another database used by the accountant is one that details the cost structure of
competitors. This information is compiled by a combination of the marketing and
engineering staffs through a process called reverse engineering. Under this metho-
dology, a company buys a competitor’s product and then disassembles it in order to
determine the processes and materials used to create them, and their costs. This
information is of great value in determining the greatest allowable cost of a new
product design, since a company can copy from the methods and materials used by a
competitor if this will lead to a reduction in costs. The information is also of use from
a pricing perspective, since it gives management some idea of the profits that a
competitor is probably obtaining from sales of its products; it can then aggressively
price some or all of its competing products low enough to take away some of the
profits the competitor would otherwise enjoy, possibly putting it in a severe financial
situation.

Another database that the accountant should peruse is that of cost data. This is not
the inventory or bill of materials data that is already available in the typical accounting
database, but rather the costs that are associated with specific product features or the
production functions required to manufacture them. This type of information is not at
all commonly found in the accounting system. Instead, the engineering staff may have
compiled, over the course of numerous design projects, a set of cost tables that itemize
the costs of those components or clusters of components that are used to give a product
a specific feature. Also, the cost of specific production functions generally requires the
in-depth analysis that can be obtained only through a prolonged activity-based
accounting review. If none of this information is available, an enterprising accountant
that is assigned to a product design team may take it upon herself to conduct this cost
research, thereby not only improving the costing database of the current product
design team, but also providing a valuable basis of information for future design
teams.

Yet another database is that of engineering data. This information does not stop
with the usual bills of materials, since it also includes notes on upcoming techno-
logical changes that can be used to enhance the features of existing products. There
should also be information about the interaction of various components of a product,
so that one can predict what cost changes are likely to arise in one subsystem of a
product if a part is reconfigured in another subsystem. Further, there should be
information available about the changes in costs that will arise by using a smaller or
greater number of fasteners, different materials, different product sizes or weights, or


10-8 How Do | Control the Target Costing Process? 239

a host of other factors. All of this information is not easily reduced into a standard
database format, and so it tends to be partially paper based and not so well organized as
the information stored in other databases. Nonetheless, this is a valuable tool for the
accountant, since it yields many clues regarding how costs can be altered as a result of
changes in product designs.

The final database that is available to the cost accounting member of a design
team is supplier information. This should include information about the pre-
vious quality, cost, and on-time delivery performance of all key suppliers, as well
as the production capacity capabilities of each one. It may even reach a sufficient
level of detail to include assumed profitability levels for each supplier. The
accountant can use this information to determine which standard parts are no
longer acceptable for future product designs, based on a history of high costs, poor
quality, or inadequate on-time delivery performance. Also, if suppliers clearly
have inadequate profits, this may signal their inability to obtain further cost
reductions through capital asset purchases, which may call for the need to switch
to a different supplier.

Based on the wide variety of data sources noted in this section, it is evident that the
accountant who is an integral member of a product design team has access to a great
deal of information that is of great use in determining product prices and costs.
However, few of these data sources are the same as the typical accountant is used to
accessing, nor do they contain the extremely high level of data accuracy that is more
common in an accounting database. Consequently, the accountant who uses this
information must be well trained in its use as well as its shortcomings, and be able to
use it to realistically portray expected cost and margin levels, given its imprecise
nature.

10-8 HOW DO | CONTROL THE TARGET
COSTING PROCESS?

 

A target costing program will eventually result in major cost reductions if design
teams are given an unlimited amount of time to pass through a multitude of
design iterations. However, there comes a point where the cost of maintaining the
design team exceeds that of the savings to be garnered from additional iterations.
Also, most products must be released within a reasonably short time frame, or else
they will miss the appropriate market window when they will beat the delivery of
competing products into the market. To avoid both of these cost and time delays, we
use milestones as the principal control point over a target costing program.
There should be a number of milestone reviews incorporated into a target costing
program. Each one should include a thorough analysis of the progress of the design
team since the last milestone review, such as a comparison of the current cost of a
design as compared with its target cost. The key issue here is that the amount of cost
yet to be worked out of a product must shrink, on either a dollar or percentage basis,
after each successive milestone review, or else management has the right to cancel


240 Management Accounting Best Practices

the design project. For example, there may be a standard allowable cost variance of
12 percent for the first milestone meeting, then 10 percent at the next meeting, and so
on until the target cost must be reached by a specific future milestone date. If a
design team cannot quite reach its target cost, but comes very close, then the
management team should be required to make a go/no-go decision at that time that
either overrides the cost target and sends the design into production, allows time for
additional design iterations, or terminates the project.

A milestone can be based on a time budget, such as one per month, or on the points
in the design process when specific activities are completed. For example, a milestone
review will occur as soon as each successive design iteration has been completed, or
perhaps when conceptual drawings are finished, when the working model has been
created, or when the production pilot has been run. In this latter case, there will be
many more steps that the management group can build into the milestone review
process, so that cost analyses become a nearly continual part of the target costing
regimen.

10-9 UNDER WHAT SCENARIOS IS TARGET
COSTING USEFUL?

 

Target costing is most useful in those situations where the majority of product costs
are locked in during the product design phase. This applies to most manufactured
products, but few services. In the services arena, such as consulting, the bulk of all
activities can be reconfigured for cost reduction during the “‘production”’ phase,
which is when services are being provided directly to the customer. In the services
environment, the “design team”’ is still present, but is more commonly concerned
with the streamlining of the activities conducted by those employees who are
providing the service, which can continue to be enhanced at any time, not just
when the initial services process is being laid out.

For example, a design team can lay out the floor plan of a fast-food restaurant,
with the objective of creating an arrangement that allows employees to walk the
shortest possible distances while preparing food and serving customers; this is
similar to the design of a new product. However, unlike a product design, this layout
can be readily altered at any time if the design team can arrive at a better layout, so
that the restaurant staff can continue to experience high levels of productivity
improvement even after the initial design and layout of the restaurant facility. In this
situation, costs are not locked in during the design phase, so there is less need for
target costing.

Another situation in which target costing results in less value is the production of
raw materials, such as chemicals. In this case, there are no design features for a design
team to labor over; instead, the industrial engineering staff tries to create the most
efficient possible production process, which has little to do with cost reduction
through the improvement of customer value through the creation of a product with a
high ratio of features to costs.


10-11 How Can | Measure the Success of a Target Costing Program? 241

10-10 HOW CAN | INCORPORATE TARGET COSTING
INTO THE BUDGET?

 

In order to increase the level of accuracy in the budgeted cost of goods sold, there
should be a linkage between the product design teams and the budgeting staff. This
should involve a requirement for all accountants participating in product design teams
to forward status reports to the budgeting staff for the current status of all product
design projects for which target costing is used. This has the following positive
impacts on the budgeting process:

¢ The preliminary budget can be adjusted continually to reflect the go/no-go status
of each design project. Thus, if the decision is made to eliminate a prospective
product, its related revenues and costs can be immediately removed from the
budget model.

¢ The budgeted cost of goods sold for each product can be adjusted to match the
estimated final cost of each new product design.

To incorporate this target costing information into the budgeting process, the
budget model must already itemize revenues and costs at the individual product level.
However, if the current budget model aggregates revenues and costs only at the
product line level, one can at least incorporate into the model (in percentage terms) the
general impact expected from a target costing program.

10-11 HOW CAN | MEASURE THE SUCCESS
OF A TARGET COSTING PROGRAM?

 

The best measure of the success of a target costing program is the ratio of total actual
product costs to target costs. The goal should be to achieve a percentage of 100 percent
or less. To calculate this measurement, divide the total of actual expected product
costs by the total amount of targeted costs. A footnote should accompany this
measurement, stating the expected production volume at which the costs are stated.
The reason for this extra wording is that component costs can change drastically if
assumed volumes vary. For example, if a target cost is based on an expected unit
volume of 50,000, but the actual expected costs are based on a revised unit volume of
only 10,000, then it is quite likely that the cost of components will increase
dramatically. The formula is as follows:

Total of actual product costs
Total of target costs

For example, the engineering manager for a copier design team is conducting a
post-design review of the team’s performance. The team did not meet its target cost
goal, and the manager is wondering what could have given earlier warning of the


242 Management Accounting Best Practices

costing problem. She has obtained the following information about design costs over
the term of the project:

 

 

Milestone 1 Milestone 2 Milestone 3 Approval

Actual cost $2,050 $1,970 $1,880 $1,820

Target cost $1,640 $1,640 $1,640 $1,640

Ratio of actual to 125% 120% 115% 111%
target cost

Expected ratio 125% 112% 108% 100%

 

The measurements in the table show that the design team was on track at the first
design milestone by keeping actual expected costs at a level 25 percent higher than the
final target cost. However, the team slipped significantly at the second milestone, and
was never able to reduce costs thereafter, resulting in a final design that was 11 percent
more expensive than the target. More active management of the design process after
the second milestone might have prevented this problem from arising.

The element missing from this measurement is the quality of the resulting
products. A design team can quite possibly achieve a target cost and issue a completed
product design, but if its associated warranty and scrap costs are too high, the lifetime
cost of the product to the company will exceed the initial target cost. Consequently,
this measure must be coupled with a set of minimum quality specifications; one may
also want to track lifetime target costs, rather than just the initial target product costs,
in order to quantify the cost of quality.

Another issue, as noted under the description of the formula, is that the individual
component costs used to compile the total target cost can vary greatly, depending on
the assumed volume of production; this is because components that are purchased in
bulk are typically less expensive than when they are bought in small quantities, as
would be the case for small production volumes.

An additional issue is that a design team usually is required to meet increasingly
stringent costing targets as it moves closer to the final approval of its product design.
As it passes each design milestone, its actual projected cost is expected to come a bit
closer to the target cost. Consequently, it makes sense to calculate this measurement at
every milestone and compare it with the target cost at that point, rather than waiting
until completion of the entire project to see whether the costing goal was attained. By
measuring on this trend line, management can spot design cost problems early, and
correct them before designs are finalized.

Pricing Decisions

The realm of price setting is an arcane one for the accountant, who is frequently asked
for advice regarding the best price at which a product or service should be set. This
apparently simple issue involves a multitude of questions, including how low a price can
be set, how to determine long-range prices, whether to follow the pricing of the industry
leader, how to set transfer prices, and what to do about predatory pricing or dumping by
competitors. The answers to these questions, and more, can be found in this chapter.

The following table itemizes the section number in which the answers to each
question posed in this chapter can be found:

11-1 WHAT IS THE LOWEST PRICE THAT |
SHOULD ACCEPT?

 

A customer may call with a special request for an order that is priced very low. The
customer may be playing off the company against another one of its suppliers, or perhaps
has a very large order, or maybe is just fishing for a good deal—the reason for a low
pricing request does not matter. The company has to decide whether it will take the offer.

The basic rule is that the lowest price is the one that at least covers all variable costs
of production, plus a small profit. Anything lower would cost a company money to
produce and therefore would make no economic sense. The main issue becomes the
determination of what variable costs to include in the variable cost calculation.
Variable costs may include the following:

¢ Direct labor
¢ Direct machine costs

243


244 Management Accounting Best Practices

¢ Inventory carrying costs

* Materials

¢ Ordering costs

* Quality costs (testing, inspection, and rework)
¢ Receiving costs

¢ Scrap costs

The costs in this list are those that may vary directly with production volume. Not
every item will be considered a variable cost at some companies. For example, if the
purchasing staff is unlikely to be laid off as a result of not taking the customer order,
then the purchasing cost is probably not a variable one; the same reasoning can be
used to assume that the receiving costs and even the direct labor costs are not really
variable. Also, the direct machine costs, such as for utilities and any volume-related
maintenance or machine labor, may be still be incurred even if the order is not
accepted, and so will not be called variable. Given all these exceptions, it is apparent
that the product’s list of variable costs may be quite small (possibly only the cost of
materials), resulting in an equally small cost that must be covered by the customer’s
price.

There are several objections to the exclusion of overhead costs from the
pricing formula. First, it may result in extremely low price points that will not
allow a company to cover all of its expenses, which results in a loss. Over the
long term, this is an accurate assessment. However, in the short term, if a
company has excess production capacity available and can use it to sell addi-
tional product that generates throughput, then it should do so in order to incre-
ase profits. If its production capacity is already maximized, then proposed sales
having lower throughput levels than items already being manufactured should
be rejected.

Second, traditional accounting holds that a small proposed order that requires a
lengthy machine setup should have the cost of that setup assigned to the product;
if the additional cost results in a loss on the proposed transaction, then the sale
should be rejected. However, it is quite likely that a company’s existing production
capacity can absorb the cost of the incremental setup without incurring any
additional cost. Under this logic, if there is excess production capacity, then setups
are free. This approach tends to result in a company offering a much richer mix
of order sizes and products to its customers, which can yield a greater market
share. However, this concept must be used with caution, for at some point the
ability of the company to continually set up small production jobs will maxi-
mize its capacity, at which point there will be an incremental cost to adding more
production jobs.

The third issue arises not from traditional cost accounting, but from federal
government pricing rules. If a company enters into a contract to offer products or
services to the federal government at a certain predetermined price, a key provision of
the contract will be that the government will automatically receive the lowest price


11-2 How Do | Set Long-Range Prices? 245

offered by the company to any of its customers. Consequently, when reviewing new
pricing proposals, the sales staff should be mindful of how a new price point will
impact any existing sales to and throughput arising from transactions with the federal
government.

The short-term pricing concept is best illustrated with an example. A customer of
the Low-Ride Bicycle Company wants to buy 1,000 bicycles from it, which it will sell
in another country where it has recently opened a sales branch. The customer wants
Low-Ride to offer its best possible price for this deal. The manager of Low-Ride
knows that the same offer is being made to the company’s chief competitor, Easy-
Glide Bicycles. The company’s cost to create a bicycle in a lot size of 1,000 units is as
follows:

Cost Per Unit

Direct labor $13.50
Direct machine cost 20.17
Inventory carrying cost None
Materials 72.15
Ordering costs Fixed
Quality costs 3.02
Receiving costs Fixed
Scrap costs 7.22

Total Cost $116.06

The owner of Low-Ride has received the request for pricing at the slowest time
of the production year, when he normally lays off several staff members. He sees
this as a golden opportunity to retain employees, which is more important to him
than earning a profit on this order. Consequently, he can charge a price of as little
as $116.06 per bike, as derived in the preceding table, though this will leave him
with no profit. He has recently hired the production manager away from Easy-
Glide Bicycles, and knows that Easy-Glide has a similar cost structure, except for
20 percent higher scrap costs. Accordingly, he knows that Easy-Glide’s minimum
variable cost will be higher by $1.44. This means that he can add $1.43 to his price
and still be lower than the competing price. Therefore, he quotes $117.49 per unit
to the customer.

11-2 HOW DO I SET LONG-RANGE PRICES?

 

The pricing decisions just outlined for short-range situations are ones that will
bring a company to the brink of bankruptcy if it uses them at all times, for they do
not allow for a sufficient profit margin to pay for a company’s overhead, not to
mention the profit it needs in order to provide some return to investors on their


246 Management Accounting Best Practices

capital. Proper long-range pricing requires the consideration of several additional
costs, which are as follows:

¢ Product-specific overhead costs. This is the overhead associated with the
production of a single unit of production. This tends to be a very small cost
category, for if a cost can be accurately identified down to this level, it is
considered to be a variable cost instead of a fixed one.

¢ Batch-specific overhead costs. A number of overhead costs are accumulated
at this level, such as the cost of labor required to set up or break down a
machine for a batch of production, the utility cost required to run machines
for the duration of the batch, the cost of materials handlers needed to
move components to the production area as well as remove finished products
from it, and an allocation of the depreciation on all machinery used in the
process.

¢ Product line-specific overhead costs. A product line may have associated
with it the salary of a product manager, a design team, a production supervisor,
and quality control personnel, customer service, distribution, advertising
costs, and an ongoing investment in inventory. All of these overhead costs
can be allocated to the products that are the end result of the overhead costs
incurred.

¢ Facility-specific overhead costs. Production must take place somewhere, and the
cost of that ‘“‘somewhere”’ should be allocated to the production lines housed
within it, usually based on the square footage taken up by the machines used in
each production process. The costs of overhead in this category can include
building depreciation, taxes, insurance, maintenance, and the cost of any main-
tenance staff.

The costs described here can greatly exceed the total variable cost of a product, as
described under the preceding section. When fully applied to all products manu-
factured, the marketing staff will commonly find that the resulting product costs are
several times higher than is the case when only variable costs are considered. This is
a particular concern for companies that require a large (and expensive) base of
automated machinery to manufacture their products, for they have such a large
investment in overhead that they must add on a very large additional cost to their
variable costs, as well as a reasonable profit, before arriving at a long-range price that
will adequately cover all costs.

The size of the markup added to the variable and fixed costs of a product should
at least equal the target rate of return. This rate is founded on a firm’s cost of
capital, which is the blended cost of all debt and equity currently held. If the
markup margin used is lower than this amount, then a company will not be able to
pay off debt or equity holders over the long term, thereby reducing the value of
the company and driving it toward bankruptcy. It may also be necessary to increase
the target rate of return by several additional percentage points, in case managers


11-3 How Should | Set Prices Over the Life of a Product? 247

feel that the product in question may have a high risk of not selling over a
prolonged period of time at adequate levels; by increasing the markup, the price is
driven higher, and the company earns back its investment sooner than would
otherwise be the case (assuming that customers are still willing to buy the product
at the higher price).

To continue with the example from the previous question, if the Low-Ride Bicycle
Company wants to determine its long-range bicycle price, it should include the
additional factors noted in the following table, which covers all possible fixed costs
plus a markup to cover its cost of capital:

Cost Per Unit

 

 

Total variable cost $116.06
Product-specific overhead costs 0.00
Batch-specific overhead costs 41.32
Product line-specific overhead costs 5.32
Facility-specific overhead costs 1.48
Markup of 12% 19.70

Total long-range price $183.88

11-3 HOW SHOULD | SET PRICES OVER THE LIFE
OF A PRODUCT?

 

It may not be sufficient to think of long-range pricing as just the addition of
all fixed costs to a product’s variable costs. Such thinking does not factor in all
changes in a product’s costs and expected margins that can reasonably be
expected over the course of its market life. For example, if one were to compile
the full cost of a product at the point when it has just been developed, the cost per
unit will be very high, for sales levels will be quite small; this means that
production runs will also be short, so that overhead costs per unit will be very
high. Also, it is common for a company with the first new product in a market
to add a high margin onto this already high unit cost, resulting in a very high
initial price. Later in the product’s life, it will gain greater market share, so that
more products are manufactured, resulting in lower overhead costs per unit.
However, competing products will also appear on the market, which will force the
company to reduce its margins in order to offer competitive pricing. Thus, the full
cost of a product will vary depending on the point at which it is currently residing
in its life cycle.

The best way to deal with long-range pricing over the course of a product’s
entire life cycle is to use a company’s previous history with variations in cost,
margin, and sales volume for similar products to estimate likely cost changes in a
new product during its life cycle. An example of this is shown in Exhibit 11.1.

Total Margin $103,500 $300,000 $191,700 $595,200

 

The exhibit shows that a company will have a considerable amount of
overhead costs to recoup during the startup phase of a new product life cy-
cle, which will require a high price per unit, given the low expected sales
volume at this point. However, setting a very high initial price for a product
leaves a great deal of pricing room for competitors to enter the market; accord-
ingly, many companies are now choosing to initially lose money on new pro-
duct introductions by setting their prices at the long-range price rather than at
the short-range price that is needed to recoup startup costs. By doing so, they
send a signal to potential market entrants that they are willing to compete at
low initial price points that will leave little room for outsized profits by new
market entrants. This strategy forgoes large initial profits, but may reduce the
number of competitors, thereby reducing the level of competition in the long
run.

The exhibit also shows that sales volumes will gradually decline as a product
enters the maturity phase of its life cycle. At this point, price competition becomes
fierce, as competitors strive to fill their production capacity by undercutting compe-
titors. The company must make a decision at this point to either compete with low
prices, terminate a product, or replace it with an improved one that is just starting a
new product life cycle.

Based on a table similar to that shown in Exhibit 11.1, a company can
determine the most appropriate pricing strategy to adopt over a product’s entire
life cycle, so that the company is appropriately positioned in the marketplace and
can earn the greatest possible profit over the entire period during which a product
is sold.

11-4 HOW DO | DETERMINE COST-PLUS PRICING?

 

There are some cases where a company is asked by a customer to quote a price on a pro-
ject or product that is so difficult to produce that the company is at great risk of incurring
large cost overruns in order to complete it. An example of this is practically any new
defense project involving leading-edge technology, such as weapons that have never even
been designed before, much less produced. In these cases, a company will typically quote
an astronomically high price, which will give it a sufficient amount of margin cushion to
yield a healthy profit on the endeavor, no matter how expensive it is to complete. The custo-
mer usually cannot support the high price, and instead offers a cost-plus pricing contract.
Cost-plus pricing is when a customer reimburses a company for all of the costs
incurred to develop and produce a product that it has ordered, plus a predetermined
margin. There is a strong incentive for a company to agree to such a pricing deal, for
there is no way to lose—all costs are guaranteed to be covered by the customer. For this
very reason, however, the customer is very concerned that only those costs are charged
to it that are contractually agreed upon in advance. These allowable costs may be
itemized in great detail in the contract with a customer. All variable costs will always
be reimbursable; the main issue instead is how much overhead can be charged to the
contract. For example, there will be a preset percentage of total plant or corporate
overhead that can be charged, which cannot be exceeded. There may also be a pricing
formula that allows only a certain amount of overhead to be charged to a project that is
incurred for a set of projects (such as the cost of an engineering supervisor who
reviews the work for several projects at once). The amounts of these allocation
percentages tend to be negotiated for each contract, so they are never consistent.

There may also be stipulations in a cost-plus agreement that some portion of cost
savings created by the company will be shared with the customer. This rule is required
by many customers on the reasonable grounds that they are footing the entire bill for
any overruns in costs, so they should be entitled to a share of any cost reductions. If this
stipulation is present, then the accountant must create a tracking system that identifies
and accumulates all cost savings, which can be a difficult chore.

Some contracts allow overhead to be allocated to a project (and then billed to the
customer) based on a set dollar rate per unit of activity (e.g., $3.25 for every hour of
direct labor incurred). Customers realize that such overhead allocation clauses can be
abused, since an excessive number of units of activity charged to a project will result in
an excessively large overhead cost being billed. Accordingly, the accountant must be
particularly careful to charge these activities to the correct jobs, and to maintain
complete records to back up this information.

11-5 HOW SHOULD | SET PRICES AGAINST A
PRICE LEADER?

 

There may be a price leader in the marketplace who sets product prices. This tends to
be a company with a dominant share of the market, and usually the lowest cost


250 Management Accounting Best Practices

structure, and who therefore can control the price of a large share of all products sold
in a particular market niche. If another company tries to sell its products at a higher
price it will find that customers will not accept the increase, for they can still buy
products from the price leader at a lower rate. If a company wants to sell its products
for less than the prices set by the price leader, it can do so, but the leader’s dominance
will probably prevent the company from gaining much market share through this
strategy. Consequently, most companies in such industries tend to adopt whatever
price points are set by the price leader. A good example of this is the Mars Company,
which has a dominant share of the candy market. It sets the prices for the products one
finds stacked at the supermarket checkout lane, and all competitors are compelled to
use the same pricing. In such cases as this, a company has no control over the price
points at which it can sell its products.

11-6 HOW DO I HANDLE A PRICE WAR?

 

When there is too much production capacity in an industry and not enough available
customer sales to use up that capacity, a common outcome is a price war, where one
company lowers its prices in order to steal customers away from a competitor, which
in turn matches or reduces these prices in order to retain its customers. During a price
war, the only winner is the customer, who experiences greatly reduced prices;
however, it is ruinous for companies that are slashing prices.

One way to avoid a price war is to analyze the perceived value of each feature of a
company’s products in relation to similar products produced by competitors. If a
company can clearly identify selected product features that a competitor’s offerings
do not contain, then these features can be heavily promoted in order to raise the
perceived overall value of the products in the eyes of customers, which allows a
company to avoid a price war. However, this analysis should be conducted well in
advance of a price war, so that the proper mix of high-value features will be present at
all times. A discerning competitor will be able to see this differentiation, and may
realize that a price war will not work.

Another option is for the accountant to conduct a competitive analysis of the
company that is initiating a price war, to see if its cost structure will not allow it to cut
prices to sustainable levels that are lower than what the company can support. If not,
then a rational pricing move by the company is to briefly cut prices to levels below the
variable cost of the competitor, thereby sending it a clear message that further price
competition will put it out of business. This is a particularly effective approach if
the accounting staff can discover whether the competitor is outsourcing its produc-
tion. If so, the entire cost of the outsourced product is variable, as opposed to a mix of
fixed and variable costs when production is kept in-house. This gives an in-house
manufacturer an advantage over an outsourced manufacturer, because the in-house
manufacturer has the option of not including fixed costs in its pricing calculations in
the short run, whereas the outsourced manufacturer has no fixed costs to exclude. This
gives the in-house manufacturer an inherent advantage in the event of a price war. For


11-6 How Do | Handle a Price War? 251

example, companies A and B produce exactly the same product. Company A
manufactures it in-house, and incurs a $10 cost that is half fixed and half variable
cost. Company B, however, outsources its production, and must pay $10 from its
supplier for each unit it buys. This manufacturing scenario gives company A the clear
advantage over company B in the event of a price war, for company A can slash its
price down to its variable cost of $5, whereas B can drop prices only to its variable cost
of $10. Thus, the type of manufacturing system used has a direct bearing on the
competitive positioning of companies that are locked in a price war.

Another option is for the accounting staff to develop a detailed rendering of the
company’s cost structure and release this information to the public, perhaps through
a professional magazine or newspaper interview. By doing so, competitors will
access the information and realize that the company’s cost structure is lower than
theirs, and that waging a price war would not result in their winning it. This option,
of course, is a viable one only for companies with a distinct cost advantage over their
competitors.

Yet another solution to a price war is to contact key customers and offer
them special long-term deals, which locks them into set pricing levels for what
will presumably be the duration of the price war. This strategy has been used by
most of the phone companies, where customers signed up for several years of
phone service at slightly reduced prices, but which turned out to be higher prices
than the going rate, as the price war drove long-distance rates ever downward. This
allowed the phone companies to earn extra revenue that would otherwise have
been lost.

Another strategy is to create a new product or product line, with new features and
market positioning, while letting the old product gradually be eliminated by a price
war. By doing so, a company allows competitors to reduce their margins to dangerous
levels while it neatly sidesteps the entire problem by concentrating on a slightly
different market. The approach can also be reversed by leaving the price point of the
old product alone, and instead designing a new and much-lower-cost product that can
more effectively compete in a price war. Yet another variation is to design a new
product that is sufficiently different that customers are faced with an apples-to-
oranges comparison of competing products; they cannot judge which competing
product is the better value, and so the price war never gets started. Any of these
approaches require a considerable amount of time to implement, and so it works best
for those companies that have a significant ability to roll out new products on a regular
basis.

If all of these options fail, then the only alternative left is to participate in a
price war. If this becomes necessary, the best way to do so is to cut prices at the
first hint of a price war, to set deeply discounted prices, and to do so with great
fanfare. By taking this aggressive approach, competitors will know that a company
is serious about its participation in a price war and that it intends to pursue the
war until all other competitors back off. This hard-and-fast response can some-
times stop a price war before it has had time to build momentum. Some companies
take this concept a step further by publicizing their intention to cut prices in the


252 Management Accounting Best Practices

business press before anyone even attempts to initiate a price war; this tells
everyone what kind of reception they can expect if they cut prices and may
keep them from starting a price war.

11-7 HOW DO | HANDLE PREDATORY PRICING
BY A COMPETITOR?

 

A company can bring charges of predatory pricing against a competitor when it feels
that the competitor is creating deals with customers that either prevent them from
doing business with the company or involve especially low pricing that is designed to
drive the company out of business. Generally, predatory pricing is considered to be
pricing activities that aim to exclude competitors from the marketplace on some other
basis than internal efficiency.

These issues are addressed by three Acts of Congress. The first is the Clayton Act,
which specifies that a company may not sell products or services to its customers on the
express condition that they do not do business with a competitor. This exclusion of
competitors can also be based on a special rebate or discount being offered to
the customer. The second Act is the Robinson-Patman Act, which is actually an
amendment to the Clayton Act. It states that it is unlawful to discriminate in price
between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where the effect
is to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of
commerce; however, one can change prices based on the costs of manufacture, sale, or
delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which such commodities
are sold. The Act does not prevent pricing changes in response to the marketability of
goods, such as the deterioration of perishable goods, obsolescence, distress sales under
court process, or upon the discontinuance of a business. Finally, the previously noted
Sherman Act can also be applied to cases of predatory pricing, since it is a clear form of
trade restriction.

The intent of these Acts is to foster competition by outlawing any predatory
pricing situations that will result in the elimination of competitors from the market-
place and that lead to a reduced number of competitors that thereby have greater
leeway to raise prices.

Proving a charge of predatory pricing is extremely difficult. It is necessary to show
that a competitor has a specific intent to monopolize a market, that it has done so
through predatory activities, and that it has a reasonably high chance of achieving its
goal of creating a monopoly. The first two issues can be proven by showing that a
competitor is indeed setting prices below its costs, while the probability of creating
a monopoly is proven by presenting a case that the competitor is likely to recoup the
costs incurred by its predatory pricing, once other companies have been driven out of
the market.

The two problems that arise in proving a case of predatory pricing are the
definition of a competitor’s product cost, and its likelihood of recouping its lost
profits. The Supreme Court has left the first issue wide open by not defining the proper


11-8 How Do | Handle Dumping by a Foreign Competitor? 253

measure of cost, preferring to let lower courts decide the issue on a case-by-case basis.
Should it be full cost, with all overhead allocated, or variable cost, with all overhead
excluded, or some point in between? In order to have a clear chance of winning a
predatory pricing case, one should be able to prove that the price charged by a
competitor is below its variable cost, which is the lowest possible cost that can be
applied to a product. If the price charged is higher than this level, then a competitor can
probably successfully defend itself on the grounds that it is making short-range
marginal pricing decisions.

It is equally difficult to prove that a competitor is likely to recoup its lost profits
from predatory pricing through the creation of a monopoly. One reason is that, once
the competitor drives other companies out of the marketplace, it will raise prices
again, which will attract new competitors to the market, thereby keeping it from
raising prices to the high levels needed for it to recoup its lost profits. There must be
significant barriers to entry that will allow the competitor to “‘own” the market for a
sufficiently lengthy period of time before new competitors will arrive and drive down
prices once again. Examples of such barriers are legal requirements, such as lengthy
licensing procedures or patents, or capacity issues, such as long lead times to build
production facilities.

Given the difficulty of proving predatory pricing, this is not a charge that is
commonly won in court. However, such a lawsuit can soak up the resources of a
competitor for a lengthy period, distracting it from daily business issues, and so such
lawsuits will appear with some regularity.

To guard against a predatory pricing lawsuit, the accountant should build a
cost tracking system that details all variable costs associated with all products
sold, so that this information can be easily compiled for presentation in court.
Further, there should be excellent documentation of the costing information
used to make short-range pricing decisions, since these are the situations that
are most likely to cause predatory pricing lawsuits to be filed. Also, this cost
information should be retained for a number of years, so that it is available for all
years contained within the statute of limitations for the states within which a
company operates. By taking these precautionary measures, a company will be
much more capable of successfully defending itself against predatory pricing
lawsuits.

11-8 HOW DO | HANDLE DUMPING BY A
FOREIGN COMPETITOR?

 

AUS. industry can experience a severe drop in sales if a competitor located in
a foreign country imports competing goods into the United States at extremely
low prices. This is known as dumping. When this occurs, an injured U.S. company
can sue the competitor directly, or can bring the issue to the attention of the
Federal Trade Commission, which is empowered under the Federal Trade


254 Management Accounting Best Practices

Commission Act to investigate the issue and increase import duties to a suffi-
cient level to erase the pricing advantage. This is a difficult charge to prove if one
bases the dumping charges on the cost of the product, so the charge is instead
based on the sale price at which the foreign company sells its products in its
home market. If the price charged in the United States is lower than the price
charged in the home country, then dumping is proven to have occurred. The exact
text of section 72 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which deals with this
issue, is as follows:

It shall be unlawful for any person importing or assisting in importing any articles from
any foreign country into the United States, commonly and systematically to import, sell
or cause to be imported or sold such articles within the United States at a price
substantially less than the actual market value or wholesale price of such articles, at
the time of exportation to the United States, in the principal markets of the country of
their production, or of other foreign countries to which they are commonly exported
after adding to such market value or wholesale price, freight, duty, and other charges
and expenses necessarily incident to the importation and sale thereof in the United
States: Provided, That such act or acts be done with the intent of destroying or injuring
an industry in the United States, or of preventing the establishment of an industry in the

articles in the United States. Any person injured in his business or property by reason of
any violation of, or combination or conspiracy to violate, this section, may sue there-

Dumping is of particular concern to accountants working for foreign-based
corporations. They must be aware of the prices charged for their products in the
entity’s home countries, as well as all ancillary costs noted in the Act, such as freight
and duty costs, and be prepared to defend their companies in court with this information
if the need arises.

11-9 WHEN IS TRANSFER PRICING IMPORTANT?

 

Many organizations sell their own products internally, from one division
to another. This is especially common in vertically integrated situations,
where a company has elected to control the key pieces of its supply chain,
perhaps to lock down the supply of key components. Each division sells its
products to a downstream division that includes those products in its own
production processes. When this happens, management must determine the
prices at which components will be sold between divisions. This is known as
transfer pricing.


11-10 How Do Transfer Prices Alter Corporate Decision Making? 255

Transfer pricing levels are very important in companies experiencing any of the
following three transfer or operational characteristics:

1. High volumes of interdivisional sales. This is most common in vertically inte-
grated companies, where each division in succession produces a component that is
a necessary part of the product being created by the next division in line. Any
incorrect transfer pricing in this scenario can cause considerable dysfunctional
purchasing behavior.

2. High volumes of segment-specific sales. Even if a company as a whole does not
transfer much product between its divisions, this does not mean that specific
departments or product lines within each division do not have a much higher
dependence on the accuracy of transfer pricing for selected products.

3. High degree of organizational decentralization. If an organization is arranged
under the theory that divisions should operate as independently as possible, then
they will have no incentive to work together unless the transfer prices used are set
at levels that give them an economic incentive to do so.

Alternatively, the theoretical foundation for the calculation of transfer prices is of
little importance for those organizations with a high degree of centralization, for
individual divisions will be ordered by the headquarters staff to produce and transfer
products to other divisions irrespective of the prices charged. This is also the case for
companies that rarely transfer any products among their divisions, for such transfers,
when they occur, are typically approved at the highest management levels if the
transfers either are large or are so small that their impact is minimal.

11-10 HOW DO TRANSFER PRICES ALTER CORPORATE
DECISION MAKING?

 

Accompany must set its transfer prices at levels that will result in the highest possible
levels of profits, not for individual divisions but rather for the entire organization. For
example, if a transfer price is set at nothing more than its cost, the selling division
would much rather not sell the product at all, even though the buying division can sell
it externally for a huge profit that more than makes up for the lack of profit experienced
by the division that originally sold it the product. The typical division manager will
select the product sales that result in the highest level of profit for only his or her
division, since the manager has no insight into (or interest in) the financial results of
the rest of the organization. Only by finding some way for the selling division to also
realize a profit will it have an incentive to sell its products internally, thereby resulting
in greater overall profits. An example of such a solution is when a selling division
creates a byproduct that it cannot sell but that another division can use as an input for
the products it manufactures. The selling division scraps the byproduct, because it has
no incentive to do anything else with it. However, by assigning the selling division a
small profit on sale of the byproduct, it now has an incentive to ship it to the buying


256 Management Accounting Best Practices

division. Such a pricing strategy assists a company in deriving the greatest possible
profit from all of its activities.

Another factor is that the amount of profit allocated to a division through the
transfer pricing method used will impact its reported level of profitability and
therefore the performance review for that division and its management team. If
the management team is compensated in large part through performance-based
bonuses, then its actions will be heavily influenced by the profit it can earn on
intercompany transfers, especially if such transfers make up a large proportion of total
divisional sales. If transfer prices are set at very high levels, this can result in the
manufacture of far more product than is needed, which may lock up so much
production capacity that the selling division is no longer able to create other products
that could otherwise have been sold for a profit. Conversely, an excessively low
transfer price will result in no production at all, as long as the selling division has some
other product available that it can sell for a greater profit. This latter situation
frequently results in late or small deliveries to buying divisions, since the managers of
the selling divisions see fit to produce low-price items only if there is spare production
capacity available that can be used in no other way. Thus, improper transfer prices will
motivate division managers in accordance with how the prices impact their perfor-
mance evaluations.

Finally, altering the transfer price used can have a dramatic impact on the amount
of income taxes a company pays, if it has divisions located in different countries that
use different tax rates. All of these issues must be considered when selecting an
appropriate transfer pricing method.

Companies that are frequent users of transfer pricing must create prices that are
based on a proper balance of the goals of overall company profitability, divisional
performance evaluation, simplicity of use, and (in some cases) the reduction of
income taxes. The attainment of all these goals by using a single transfer pricing
method is not common, and should not be expected. Instead, managers must focus on
the attainment of the most critical goals, while keeping the adverse affects of not
meeting other goals at a minimum. This process may result in the use of several
transfer pricing methods depending on the circumstances surrounding each inter-
divisional transfer.

11-11 WHAT TRANSFER PRICING METHOD SHOULD | USE?

 

The most commonly used transfer pricing technique is based on the existing external
market price. Under this approach, the selling division matches its transfer price to the
current market rate. By doing so, a company can achieve a number of goals. First, it
can achieve the highest possible corporatewide profit. This happens because the
selling division can earn just as much profit by selling all of its production outside of
the company as it can by doing so internally; there is no reason for using a transfer
price that results in incorrect behavior of either selling externally at an excessively low
price or selling internally when a better deal could have been obtained by selling


11-11 What Transfer Pricing Method Should | Use? 257

externally. Second, using the market price allows a division to earn a profit on its sales,
no matter whether it sells internally or externally. By avoiding all transfers at cost, the
senior management group can structure its divisions as profit centers, thereby
allowing it to determine the performance of each division manager. Third, the market
price is simple to obtain—it can be taken from regulated price sheets, posted prices, or
quoted prices, and applied directly to all sales. No complicated calculations are
required, and arguments over the correct price to charge between divisions are kept to
a minimum. Fourth, a market-based transfer price allows both buying and selling
divisions to shop anywhere they want to buy or sell their products. For example, a
buying division will be indifferent as to where it obtains its supplies, for it can buy
them at the same price regardless of whether that source is a fellow company division.
This leads to a minimum of incorrect buying and selling behavior that would
otherwise be driven by transfer prices that do not reflect market conditions. For
all these reasons, companies are well advised to use market-based transfer prices
whenever possible.

Unfortunately, many corporations do not use market-based transfer pricing, not
because they do not want to, but because there are no market prices available. This
happens when the products being transferred do not exactly match those sold on the
market, or if they are intermediate-level products that have not yet been converted into
final products, so there is no market price available for them. Another problem with
market-based pricing is that there must truly be an alternative for a selling division to
sell its entire production externally. This is acommon problem for specialty products,
where the number of potential buyers is small and their annual buying needs limited in
size. A final issue is that market-based pricing can drive divisions to sell their
production outside of the company. This problem arises in tight supply situations,
where a buying division cannot obtain a sufficient amount of parts from a selling
division because it is selling them externally. In this case, the selling division is
maximizing its own profit at the expense of divisions that need its output. This is
particularly important when the buying division adds so much value to the product
that it can then sell it externally at a much higher margin than could the selling
division.

Another approach is adjusted market pricing, where prices are set in order to
simplify transfer prices and adjust for the absence of sales-related costs. For example,
if market prices vary considerably by the unit volume ordered, there may be a broad
range of transfer prices in use, which can be very complicated to track. A single
adjusted market price can be used instead, which is based on the average shipment or
order size. If a buying division turns out to have purchased in significantly different
quantities than the ones that were assumed at the time prices were set, then a company
can retroactively adjust transfer prices at the end of the year; or it can leave the pricing
alone and let the divisions do a better job of planning their interdivisional transfer
volumes in the next year. As another example, there should be no bad debts when
selling between divisions, as opposed to the occasional losses incurred when dealing
with outside firms; accordingly, this cost can be deducted from the transfer price. The
same argument can be made for the sales staff, whose services are presumably not


258 Management Accounting Best Practices

required for interdepartmental sales. However, these price adjustments are subject to
negotiation, so more aggressive division managers are more likely to resist reductions
from their market-based prices, while those managing the buying divisions will push
hard for excessively large price deductions. The result may be pricing anomalies that
do not yield the optimum profit for the company as a whole.

Another option is to use negotiated transfer prices. Under this technique, the
managers of buying and selling divisions negotiate a transfer price between them-
selves, using a product’s variable cost as the lower boundary of an acceptable
negotiated price, and the market price (if one is available) as the upper boundary.
The price that is agreed upon, as long as it falls between these two boundaries, should
give some profit to each division, with more profit going to the division with better
negotiating skills. The method has the advantage of allowing division managers to
operate their businesses in a more independent manner, not relying on preset pricing.
It also results in better performance evaluations for those managers with greater
negotiation skills. However, it also suffers from some flaws. First, if the negotiated
price excessively favors one division over another, the losing division will search
outside the company for a better deal on the open market, and will direct its sales and
purchases in that direction; this may result in suboptimal companywide profitability
levels. Also, the negotiation process can take up a substantial portion of a manager’s
time, not leaving enough for other management activities. This is a particular problem
if prices require constant renegotiation. Finally, the interdivisional conflicts over
negotiated prices can become so severe that the problem is kicked up corporate
headquarters, which must step in and set prices that the divisions are incapable of
determining by themselves. For all these reasons, the negotiated transfer price is a
method that is generally relegated to special or low-volume pricing situations.

What if there is no market price at all for a product? A company then has no basis
for creating a transfer price from any external source of information, so it must use
internal information instead. One approach is to create transfer prices based on a
product’s contribution margin. Under this pricing system, a company determines the
total contribution margin earned after a product is sold externally, and then allocates
this margin back to each division based on their respective proportions of the total
product cost. There are several good reasons for using this approach. They are:

* Converts a cost center into a profit center. By using this method to assign
profits to internal product sales, divisional managers are forced to pay stricter
attention to their profitability, which helps the overall profitability of the orga-
nization.

¢ Encourages divisions to work together. When every supplying division shares in
the margin when a product is sold, it stands to reason that they will be much more
anxious to work together to achieve profitable sales, rather than bickering over the
transfer prices to be charged internally. Also, any profit improvements that can be
brought about only by changes that span several divisions are much more likely to
receive general approval and cooperation under this pricing method, since the
changes will increase profits for all divisions.


11-11 What Transfer Pricing Method Should | Use? 259

These are powerful arguments, ones which make the contribution margin approach
one that is popular as a secondary transfer pricing method, after the market price
approach. Despite its useful attributes, there are a number of issues with it that a
company must guard against in order to avoid behavior by divisions that will lead to
less-than-optimal overall levels of profitability. They are as follows:

* Can increase assigned profits by increasing costs. When the contribution margin
is assigned based on a division’s relative proportion of total product costs, it will
not take long for the divisions to realize that they will receive a greater share of
the profits if they can increase their overall proportion of costs.

¢ Must share cost reductions. If a division finds a way to reduce its costs, it will only
receive an increased share of the resulting profits that is in proportion to its share
of the total contribution margin distributed. For example, if division A’s costs are
20 percent of a product’s total costs, and division B’s share is 80 percent, then 80
percent of a $1 cost reduction achieved by division A will be allocated to division
B, even though it has done nothing to deserve the increase in margin.

¢ Requires the involvement of the corporate headquarters staff. The contribution
margin allocation must be calculated by somebody, and since the divisions all
have a profit motive to skew the allocation in their favor, the only party left that
can make the allocation is the headquarters staff. This may require the addition of
accountants to the headquarters staff, which will increase corporate overhead.

¢ Results in arguments. When costs and profits can be skewed by the system, there
will inevitably be arguments between the buying and selling divisions that the
corporate headquarters team may have to mediate. These issues detract from an
organization’s focus on profitability.

The contribution margin approach is not a perfect one, but it does give companies a
reasonably understandable and workable method for determining transfer prices. It
has more problems than market-based pricing, but can be used as an alternative, or as
the primary approach if there is no way to obtain market pricing for transferred
products.

In situations where a division cannot derive its transfer prices from the outside
market (perhaps because there is no market for its products, or it is a very small one),
the cost-plus approach may be a reasonable alternative. This method is based on its
name—just accumulate a product’s full cost, add a standard margin percentage to the
cost, and this becomes the transfer price. It has the singular advantage of being very
easy to understand and calculate, and can convert a cost center into a profit center,
which may be useful for evaluating the performance of a division manager.

Unfortunately, the cost-plus approach also has a major flaw, which is that the
margin percentage added to a product’s full cost may have no relationship to the
margin that would actually be used if the product were to be sold externally. If a
number of successive divisions were to add a standard margin to their products, the
price paid by the final division in line, the one that must sell the completed product

262 Management Accounting Best Practices

externally, may be so high that there is no room for its own margin, which gives it no
incentive to sell the product. Because of this issue, the cost-plus method is not
recommended in most situations.

A completely unique approach to the formulation of transfer prices is based on
opportunity costs. This method is not precisely based on either market prices or
internal costs, since it is founded on the concept of forgone profits. It is best described
with an example. If a selling division can earn a profit of $10,000 by selling widget A
on the outside market, but is instead told to sell widget B to a buying division of the
company, then it has lost the $10,000 that it would have earned on sale of widget A. Its
opportunity cost of producing widget B instead of A is therefore $10,000. If the selling
division can add the forgone profit of $10,000 onto its variable cost to produce widget
B, then it will be indifferent as to which product it sells, since it will earn the same
profit on the sale of either product. Thus, transfer pricing based on opportunity cost is
essentially the variable cost of the product being sold to another division, plus the
opportunity cost of profits forgone in order to create the product being sold. Under
ideal conditions, this method should result in optimum companywide levels of
profitability.

This concept is most applicable when a division is using all of its available
production capacity. Otherwise, it would be capable of producing all products at the
same time, and would have no opportunity cost associated with not selling any
particular item. To use the same example, if there were no market for widget A, on
which there was initially a profit of $10,000, there would no longer be any possible
profit, and consequently no reason to add an opportunity cost onto the sale price of
widget B. The same principle applies if a company has specialized production
equipment that can be used only for the production of a single product. In this
case, there are no grounds for adding an opportunity cost onto the price of a product,
since there are no other uses for the production equipment.

A problem with the opportunity cost approach is that there must be a substantial
external market for sale of the products for which an opportunity cost is being
calculated. If not, then there is not really a viable alternative available under which a
division can sell its products on the outside market. Thus, though a selling division
may point to the current product pricing in a thin external market as an opportunity
cost, further investigation may reveal that there is no way that the market can absorb
the division’s full production (or can do so only at a much lower price), thereby
rendering the opportunity cost invalid.

Another issue is that the opportunity cost is subject to considerable alteration. For
example, the selling division wants to show the highest possible opportunity cost on
sale of a specific product, so that it can add this opportunity cost to its other transfer
prices. Accordingly, it will skew its costing system by allocating fixed costs else-
where, showing variable costs based on very high unit production levels and the use of
the highest possible prices, to result in a very large profit for that product. This large
profit will then be used as the opportunity cost that is forgone when any other products
are sold to other divisions, thereby increasing the prices that other divisions must pay
the selling division.


11-11 What Transfer Pricing Method Should | Use? 263

This is a technique that is also difficult for the accounting staff to support, because
the opportunity cost is not an incurred cost (since it never happened) and therefore
does not appear in the general ledger. The level of understandability does not stop with
accountants, either. Division managers have a hard time understanding that a transfer
price is based on a product’s variable cost plus a margin on a different product that was
never produced. Accordingly, gaining companywide support of this concept can be a
difficult task to accomplish.

A comparison of all the transfer pricing methods just discussed is noted in
Exhibit 11.2, where each one’s problems, ease of use, and applicability to profitability
enhancement and divisional performance reviews are noted.


Chapter 12

 

Quality Decisions

The cost of quality can comprise an extremely large proportion of company
expenditures, and yet is so diffused throughout the organization that it is diffi-
cult to compile. The accountant may be called on to determine which costs
should be included in the cost of quality, as well as to develop a quality reporting
system. Other likely tasks for the accountant include how to assign the correct
costs to scrap and where to place quality review workstations in the production
area in order to maximize profitability. This chapter provides solutions to all of
these issues.

The following table itemizes the section number in which the answers to each
question posed in this chapter can be found:

Section Decision

12-1 What are the various types of quality?

12-2 How do I create a quality reporting system?

12-3 What is the cost of scrap?

12-4 How should I measure post-constraint scrap?

12-5 Where should I place quality review workstations?

12-1 WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS TYPES OF QUALITY?

 

There are four types of cost categories into which quality costs fall. It is useful to split
quality costs into these categories, for there are so many subcategories that it can be
difficult to track them all without this method of organization.

The first category of costs is prevention costs. These are the costs that a company
incurs to ensure that product failures of various kinds do not occur either during the
production process or when in the hands of a customer. These costs can also be
incurred to ensure that there are fewer process-related failures. These are discre-
tionary costs, for a company’s management may choose not to expend any funds on
prevention activities (though there will be an offsetting increase in failure costs).
Examples of prevention costs are as follows:

¢ Administration of quality-related activities. Some staff time is required to plan for
and administer quality-related prevention activities. The cost of this labor should
be supplemented by the cost of related benefits and payroll taxes.

¢ Education. A very significant expense is the preparation of training materials, the
cost of trainers and training facilities, and (the largest expense of all) the labor

264


12-1 What Are the Various Types of Quality? 265

cost of all employees attending the training. This is a key prevention activity, and
will be one of the largest costs in the prevention category.

¢ New product trial costs. For those organizations releasing new products, having
customers test product designs is a central method for ensuring a high quality of
design. Accordingly, the costs of products given to customers and survey
administration can be clustered into this subcategory.

¢ Preventive maintenance. Ensuring that machinery is capable of running when
needed is a key prevention activity. This includes the costs of maintenance
personnel engaged in preventive maintenance, as well as any related materials
and administrative costs.

¢ Preventive maintenance scheduling software. The just-noted preventive main-
tenance activities can be more easily accomplished if there is maintenance
software available that tracks the last time such maintenance was conducted
and how heavily a machine has been used since that time, and that schedules
additional maintenance based on those two factors.

¢ Procedure and instruction development. A major prevention activity is the
creation of machine operation instructions and other procedures that give
employees complete information about how to conduct their jobs. With this
information in hand, there is much less chance that any steps in the production
process will be mishandled, resulting in quality problems. The cost of this
subcategory includes the initial investigation of activities, procedure develop-
ment, and distribution of the resulting materials.

¢ Supplier qualification assessments. Products cannot have a high quality level
unless the supplier parts comprising them have high quality standards. The cost of
all employee time spent in reviewing and assessing the output of suppliers must
fall into this category.

¢ Tool design reviews. If a company uses a number of custom tools to create
products, then those tools must be carefully reviewed in terms of their ability to
produce parts at minimum specification levels, as well as their ability to do so
consistently and with minimal failure rates. The costs of these reviews and any
resulting tool revision costs must fall into this category.

* Warranty reviews. One form of prevention is to closely review all customer
warranty claims in order to discern clues regarding what product problems can be
prevented at the company before they can reach customers. The cost of this
review and any subsequent investigation of possible problems should fall into this
subcategory.

The second category of costs is appraisal costs. These are the costs incurred to
measure products, the material components used in products, and the processes used
to manufacture products. These activities are designed to reduce the number of
defective products shipped to customers. These are different from prevention costs, in
that they attempt to improve quality strictly through increased inspection activities.


266 Management Accounting Best Practices

These are also discretionary costs, for a company does not have to use any appraisal
activities whatsoever—though eliminating them will increase the number of low-
quality products shipped to customers. Examples of appraisal costs are as follows:

Incoming component testing. If there are particularly troublesome problems with
materials received from suppliers, then a company may have initiated an
extensive effort to review a large proportion of those materials, which will result
in costs not only for testing personnel, but also for any materials that are
destroyed during the testing process.

Material appraisal. \t is common for the quality control staff to remove items
from various stages of the production process for testing purposes. If the removed
materials are destroyed during testing, then the cost of these materials should be
recorded as an appraisal cost.

Outsourced laboratory testing. Some of the tests conducted on materials are of
such a specialized nature that a company finds it to be more cost-effective to send
them to an outside laboratory for review. The fees of such laboratories should be
charged to this cost subcategory.

Process appraisal. The appraisal process is not confined to materials reviews. It is
also necessary to periodically analyze how well the production and supporting
processes are functioning; the staff time devoted to this activity should be charged
to this cost subcategory.

Prototype appraisal. The quality staff can spot problems with new products
before they are produced by examining a variety of quality-related issues on
prototype products. The cost of testing and destruction of prototypes should be
grouped into this cost subcategory.

Testing equipment calibration. The testing equipment used by the quality staff
must be periodically recalibrated to ensure its accuracy. This task is frequently
performed by certified outside calibration services, which makes it easier to
identify their fees and charge them to this cost subcategory.

Testing equipment. Depending on the kinds of quality tests performed, the types
of testing equipment needed can be very expensive. If the cost of this equipment
falls below a company’s capitalization limit, then the entire cost can be charged
straight to this subcategory. If higher, then the associated deprecation expense
should be charged here.

The third category of costs is internal failure costs. These are costs incurred as a

result of discovering product defects prior to shipment. At that time, products can be
taken out of the production or warehouse areas, repaired or scrapped, and placed
back in the production process if possible. There are a number of related costs that
accompany these activities that make this a very expensive cost category. Examples of
internal failure costs are as follows:

Correction of related paperwork. When a product failure occurs internally,
resulting in rework or scrap, there are a number of resulting paperwork activities.


12-1 What Are the Various Types of Quality? 267

One is that the production scheduling staff must schedule new production to
replace the items removed from production. Also, the eliminated items must be
reported to the purchasing staff, so that they can order replacement materials.
Further, the accounting staff must determine the cost of the scrap or rework and
record it in the financial records. The staff time required to complete all of these
activities should be recorded here.

¢ Lost profit on products sold as seconds. When a company finds that it has products
of a sufficiently low quality that they cannot be sold through normal sales
channels, it may elect to sell them at a discount, rather than expend extra rework
effort to bring them up to a higher quality standard. If so, the loss in profits that
occurs when these products are sold at the lower price point should be recorded in
this subcategory as a cost or a sales discount.

¢ Machinery downtime. When internal product failures are discovered, machinery
downtime can be caused for two reasons. One is that the machines are now
needed to rework defective product, which keeps them from being used to create
new product. Also, the cause of the internal failures may be the machinery, which
requires some downtime while they are investigated and repaired. In either case,
the cost of the machinery downtime should be charged to this cost subcategory.

¢ Redesign. If a product continues to have high quality error rates over time, the
problem may not be in the manufacturing process at all, but rather in the
underlying product design. If so, the engineering staff will require extra time
to develop a new design and test it to ensure that all quality problems have been
resolved. The engineering time charged to this work should be summarized into
this cost subcategory, as well as the costs of any inventory that will become
obsolete as a result of design changes.

¢ Reinspection and testing. Once a product has been reworked, it must be inspected
and tested to ensure that it now meets quality specifications, which requires extra
staff time.

¢ Repurchasing. When products are scrapped, the purchasing staff may need to
repurchase the components needed to create replacement products. The cost of
the time needed to do this can be recorded separately here, or in the “‘corrections
to related paperwork” subcategory that is noted earlier in this list.

¢ Rework. Depending on the extent of product rework required, there may be a
separate staff devoted to this activity. If not, then production workers must be
drawn from the production line (thereby taking time away from the production of
other products) to perform this work. In either case, the cost of their time is
charged to this account. There may also be a charge for the use of any machinery
required to perform rework tasks.

¢ Safety stock. If there is a significant volume of internal product failure, the
management team may think it necessary to keep on hand large quantities of extra
components to make up the shortfall of components that would otherwise occur
due to the scrapping of low-quality products. There is an interest cost associated


268 Management Accounting Best Practices

with the investment in this extra inventory, as well as storage, insurance, and
obsolescence costs that can be accumulated into this cost subcategory.

¢ Scrap. Some products may be of such a low quality level that they cannot be
reworked, and so must be thrown away. However, some of these costs may be
recouped by the income from sale of the scrap (if this is possible). For high-cost
products, this is a very expensive subcategory of internal failure costs.

¢ Supplier claims processing. When internal failure costs are traced to supplier
quality problems, a company must not only ship back defective supplier parts, but
also process claims against the offending suppliers, so that it will not have to pay
for the low-quality parts. This claims processing step can be an administrative
headache, and an expensive one where there are many supplier-caused quality
problems.

The final category of costs is external failure costs. These are the costs incurred
when low-quality products are shipped to customers. This tends to be the most
difficult quality cost area to measure, because it is difficult to quantify some customer-
related costs (as noted in the following bullet points). There is general agreement
among quality experts that these costs are the most expensive of all the various cost-
of-quality categories, for the loss of customers due to low quality can have a
catastrophic impact on an organization’s profitability. Examples of external failure
costs are as follows:

* Customer surveys. A company may conduct customer surveys for the sole reason
that it needs feedback about the quality of products issued to them. If this is the
only reason for creating and operating a survey (as opposed to one that is used by
the marketing department for product positioning and pricing purposes), then the
cost of the survey can be charged to this account.

* Customer-imposed penalties. Customers who use a company’s output in their
products may have considerable concerns about the quality of incoming com-
ponents and will reinforce these concerns with their suppliers by charging
penalties for poor-quality production. If so, these penalties should certainly
be segregated into a separate account, so that management can easily determine
their extent.

¢ Invoice adjustments. The cost of processing alterations to customer invoices can
be very time-consuming, especially when there are a large volume of customer
returns, for each transaction tends to be a unique one that requires a great deal of
time. If this activity requires a significant amount of time, the associated cost can
be stored separately in this account; if not, it may be rolled into the “Processing
customer returns” account (as noted later in this list).

¢ Loss of customers. This is the potentially largest cost in the external failure cost
category. It can be quantified by tracking those customers who are no longer
buying from the company, contacting them to determine whether low quality was
the reason, and then calculating the lost profit based on sales to those customers in


12-2 How Do | Create a Quality Reporting System? 269

the preceding year. Though the resulting figure will not tie to any cost recorded
through a traditional accounting system, the opportunity cost of sales lost should
still be itemized in this account, due to its potential size.

¢ Loss of reputation. A potentially very large expense is the reduction in a
company’s reputation when it continually sells low-quality products. This is a
very difficult cost to calculate or even estimate, so most companies do not use this
cost account, preferring instead to simply itemize the potential for this cost in the
narrative sections of their quality cost reports.

¢ Processing customer returns. Whenever a customer returns a product, the receiving
staff must complete special paperwork on it, store it in a special location, have it
reviewed by a quality control team, and disposition it in accordance with their
instructions, while the accounting staff must process a credit to the customer. The
costs of all these activities should be charged to this account.

¢ Product recall insurance. If a company has a history of conducting product
recalls, it may be necessary to reduce its risk of incurring further recall-related
costs by procuring a product recall insurance policy. However, this can be a very
expensive policy to obtain, especially if there is a recent recall history. The cost is
certainly high enough to place in its own separate account.

¢ Product recall. If a company finds that quality problems with a product are
sufficiently extensive, it can recall them. There are many costs when this happens,
including payment for the inbound freight costs for returned products, the cost of
reworking defective products, the cost of issuing replacement products, and the
administrative overhead associated with these tasks. This can be an inordinately
expensive cost subcategory.

¢ Supplier warranty claim processing. When customers return products, there is a
good chance that the cause of their complaints is issues with product components
that were sold to the company by its suppliers. If so, the company must expend
considerable effort in filling out warranty claim forms to send to its suppliers in
order to obtain reimbursement for shoddy components. These administrative
costs should be charged to this account.

* Warranty claim administration. When there are many product returns from
customers, a company will find it necessary to create a full-time warranty claims
department. The cost of the staff for this department, as well as all associated
overhead costs, should be charged to this account.

12-2 HOW DOI CREATE A QUALITY REPORTING SYSTEM?

 

The key issue in creating a quality measurement and reporting system is determining
which costs to track. Since the cost of data collection can be considerable, the best
approach is to consider the following items when determining the types of costs to be
tracked:


270 Management Accounting Best Practices

¢ Ability to measure an activity. Some activities are extremely hard to measure.
For example, the accounting staff does not have a good method for determining
the time it takes each day to issue credits to customers for low-quality products
that have been returned, nor does the production staff usually track the time it
takes to rework low-quality products. An extremely difficult quality cost is the
cost of lost sales from customers who take their business elsewhere. The
accountant must evaluate the ability of the organization to collect such informa-
tion, and determine whether it is sufficient to report estimated costs in lieu of
“real” data.

¢ Available resources. The resources required to set up and maintain a comp-
lete quality cost tracking system will exceed the investment in a company’s
normal accounting systems, due to the in-depth nature of the information that
must be obtained. Accordingly, always determine the cost required to collect each
type of quality cost information and offset this with the benefits of the uses to
which the information can be put. This will usually result in a much smaller
number of quality cost items being tracked with any degree of regularity.

* Continuing need for information. Many organizations prefer to reduce quality
costs through short-term projects that have tightly defined beginning and ending
points. They do not require cost information after a project is completed, just a
summary report that itemizes the success (or failure) of each project. In such
cases, there is no need to continually report on issues that have long since been
resolved.

¢ Nonfinancial measures. Financial measures are most commonly used by senior
management, which must compare the results obtained from its investments in
quality-related projects to the related investments. However, lower levels of the
organization require measurements that are based primarily on units, such as
percentages of scrap reduction or parts per million of rework. These measures are
more relevant to their activities. Accordingly, the preponderance of information
gathered by the accountant may be nonfinancial in nature.

* Quality objectives. The quality cost tracking system should primarily support a
company’s quality cost reduction efforts. This means that if management wants to
focus its attention on a few specific quality issues, then the measurement system
should be designed to provide the highest possible level of detail about just those
areas. The next highest level of accuracy should be for measurements of areas that
management has on its agenda for near-term improvements. Low-priority areas
can be measured less precisely. Thus, the level of detail for quality cost
measurements will vary in accordance with the current and short-term quality
cost reduction goals of management.

The next issue is how to organize the selected quality costs into a data storage
system. The central issue here is the structure to be used for the chart of accounts, so
that these costs can be properly recorded in the general ledger. An example is shown in
Exhibit 12.1, where we use a three-digit code to represent each of the four types of

quality costs. In the example, there are additional spaces in the chart of accounts
numbering system, in case the accountant decides to further subdivide the costs. For
example, when using the code for equipment preventive maintenance costs (which is
120), one may decide to further subdivide costs for each machine in the facility; so if
we assign a subcode of 27 to a specific machine, then the maintenance cost for that
machine becomes 120-27. We can further subdivide the costs if it seems necessary to
further refine the cost tracking system. For example, if we want to break down the
materials, labor, and other maintenance costs for each machine, we can add a few
more digits to the account code; to trace the labor cost of preventive maintenance for
machine 27, we can use the code 120-27-01. By using increasingly detailed chart of
accounts codes in which to store the cost of quality data, an accountant can subdivide

the information in more ways, allowing her to create and issue a greater variety of
reports.

The information accumulated through the new chart of accounts can be pre-
sented in a variety of ways to suit the needs of the recipient. One format is shown in
Exhibit 12.2, which itemizes the various costs that roll up into each of the four
main cost categories. Its primary uses are to communicate costs to senior manage-
ment and to show what cost line items are the largest, and are therefore worthy of
more in-depth discussion. For example, the exhibit shows that scrap and rework
costs are by far the largest internal failure costs, while field service and customer
complaint processing expenses are the largest external failure costs. However, this

with others, depending on a company’s specific needs). One can also add many more
columns, if it seems necessary to itemize the report for more types of costs. This extra
level of detail allows managers at the facility level to more easily track down and
reduce quality costs.

Another reporting possibility is to construct reports that itemize the budgeted and
actual quality costs for each period, as well as the variance between the two figures. In
Exhibit 12.4, the report also includes additional columns for year-to-date information.
This type of report structure is essential for those organizations with enough historical
budgeting information to conduct comparisons, and with a long-term plan to use this
information as the basis for long-range quality cost reductions. It is also very useful for
conducting performance evaluations of those managers who are responsible for
controlling quality costs.

The preceding reports have focused on splitting specific accounting categories of
costs into finer levels of detail. These formats are useful for locating and reducing
specific types of costs. However, they do not draw management’s attention to the
specific processes within an organization that are causing problems. An example of a
format that resolves this problem is shown in Exhibit 12.5, where we have sorted the
four main types of quality costs by the steps in an injection molding production pro-
cess. By using this approach, managers can quickly tell which production steps are
incurring the majority of quality-related costs, and can focus their attention accord-
ingly on the major offenders. In the exhibit, the injection molding process is incurring
the majority of costs, while the assembly operation is a distant runner-up.

By comparing the costs of problems and the costs to correct them, management
can determine which corrections will result in the largest net increase in profits. An
example of the reporting format that contains the cost-benefit trade-off of each
correction activity is shown in Exhibit 12.6. The example lists the root causes of
quality problems down the left side, along with correction activities for each one.
Then the costs of each root cause are reduced by the cost of each correction activity to
determine the net change in costs.

12-3 WHAT IS THE COST OF SCRAP?

 

Under traditional cost accounting, the cost of any scrapped item will be its fully
absorbed cost. For example, the following table shows that a product passing through a
series of work centers will accumulate the cost of each work center, and will have a
progressively higher scrap cost if it is scrapped later in the production process:

 

 

Work Work Center Work Center Product Total Scrap
Center Cost Added Cumulative Cost + Variable Cost = Cost
No. 1 $2.05 $2.05 $8.25 $10.30
No. 2 0.35 2.40 8.25 10.65
No. 3 1.15 3.55 8.25 11.80
No. 4 4.80 8.35 8.25 16.60
No. 5 1.80 10.15 8.25 18.40

 

Instead, the location of the constrained resource should dictate the cost of the scrap.
If scrap occurs prior to the constrained resource, then the cost of the scrap is strictly the
variable cost of the work-in-process, which is usually only its material cost. No addi-
tional cost is assigned based on the number of work centers involved in processing the


278 Management Accounting Best Practices

scrapped item, because these upstream workstations have excess capacity, and so can
easily process replacement inventory for free. The basic concept for this type of scrap is
that a work center’s production capability is free as long as it has excess capacity.

However, the cost assignment scenario changes radically if scrap occurs either
at the constrained resource or anywhere downstream from it. If scrap occurs in
these areas, it must be replaced with another part that will use up additional time at the
constrained resource. Thus, the cost of scrap occurring either at or following the
constrained resource is the lost throughput that would have been realized if the item
had not been scrapped. The calculation of post-constraint scrap is to compile the
constraint hours spent to produce all scrap occurring at or after the constraint, and then
multiply this by the average throughput per hour generated by the constraint.

The preceding scrap example is presented again below, but now we assume that the
constrained resource is work center no. 3. In the example, we assume that the average
throughput per hour generated by the constrained resource is $2,000, and that one unit
of a scrapped item requires three minutes of operating time by the constrained
resource, which translates to an opportunity cost of $100 ($2,000 x 3/60):

 

 

Work Throughput Product Total Scrap
Center Opportunity Cost + Variable Cost = Cost
No. 1 $0.00 $8.25 $8.25
No. 2 0.00 8.25 8.25
No. 3 100.00 0 100.00
No. 4 100.00 0 100.00
No. 5 100.00 0 100.00

 

Quality improvement investments at or downstream from the constrained
resource are an excellent idea, since they prevent the loss of constraint time. For
example, the Candy Stripe Company, maker of two-tone toothpaste, is evaluating a
proposal to reduce the scrap rejection rate of its product. The company is currently
throwing out 1,000 tubes of toothpaste per hour, all downstream of the constrained
resource. Its constrained resource is the packaging machine, which uses a multi-
nozzle dispenser to fill different colors of toothpaste into the toothpaste tube. The
machine produces 5,000 tubes of toothpaste per hour, which is $2,500 of throughput
per hour. The proposal is intended to eliminate downstream bursting of the tubes
through overfilling, which requires an investment of $250,000 in a replacement
multinozzle dispenser that more precisely fills each tube. The dispenser will require
replacement once a year.

All scrap is downstream from the constraint, so the average hourly throughput rate
of $2,500 is the appropriate cost to apply to the scrap. The scrap rate is 20 percent of
hourly production, so the scrap cost is 20 percent of the average hourly throughput
rate, or $500 per hour. If the company invests in the new multinozzle dispenser, it will
require 500 hours of throughput to repay the investment ($250,000 investment/$500
per hour of throughput savings). Since the company runs on an eight-hour day, this


12-4 How Should | Measure Post-Constraint Scrap? 279

means that the investment will be recouped in just over two months, leaving nearly 10
more months in which to generate additional throughput from the investment. Thus,
the investment proposal should be accepted.

In summary, never assign an accumulated overhead cost based on how far
inventory has come in the production process before being scrapped; instead, assign
scrap costs based on the simple criterion of whether scrap occurs before or after the
constrained resource.

12-4 HOW SHOULD | MEASURE POST-CONSTRAINT
SCRAP?

 

An excellent way to increase the total amount of system throughput is to avoid
scrap that occurs after the constraint. These items have already been processed by
the con-strained resource, and so have used up bottleneck capacity that cannot be
recovered. Consequently, one of the best throughput-related measurements is
for scrap occurring after the constrained resource. The measurement is to compile
the constraint hours spent to produce all scrap occurring after the constraint, and
then multiply this by the average throughput per hour generated by the constraint.
The calculation follows:

(Constraint hours spent to produce scrap) x (Throughput per hour)

Conversely, scrap occurring before the constrained resource does not impact
constraint utilization, and so is much less important from the perspective of
throughput generation.

For example, the primary component of the Dumper Wheelbarrow Company’s
legendary HaulMax Wheelbarrow is its oversized, heavy-gauge steel tray. The
company’s constrained resource is a sheet metal—bending machine required to
produce each tray. Subsequently, holes are drilled in the tray so that it can be bolted
to the wheelbarrow frame. If the holes are drilled off-center, then the wheelbarrow
must be scrapped.

A number of trays are being scrapped because of this drilling problem. Dumper’s
controller wants to determine the cost of post-constraint scrap. To do so, she acc-
umulates the number of scrapped trays in the past month (120 trays) and uses routing
documents to determine the average amount of constraint time used for the production
of each tray (0.15 hours). She then calculates the constraint’s average throughput per
hour as $1,850. With this information, she compiles the cost of post-constraint scrap
as follows:

(120 Scrapped trays x 0.15 Hours) x ($1,850 Throughput per hour) = $33,300

Wooden frames for the HaulMax do not use the constrained resource at all, but are
still subject to drilling problems that require many frames to be discarded. Dumper’s
controller calculates the cost of these scrapped items as the number of units scrapped

(190 in the past month) multiplied by the variable cost of each frame ($17), which is a
total cost of $3,230. Clearly, Dumper should concentrate its efforts on fixing the
downstream tray drilling problem rather than the unrelated frame drilling problem in
order to more quickly maximize its throughput.

12-5 WHERE SHOULD | PLACE QUALITY REVIEW
WORKSTATIONS?

 

The placement of a quality review workstation in the production area can have a major
impact on profitability. If placed just in front of the constrained resource, it keeps low-
quality items from using up valuable processing time at the constraint. If these work-
in-process items were to pass through the constrained resource and then be thrown out
as scrap, then the capacity of the constraint used to produce them would have
essentially been wasted. Thus, the correct analysis for the installation of a quality
workstation is to weigh the cost of the additional quality review staff and equipment
against the throughput saved by not running all detected scrap through the constrained
resource.

What if the quality review station were to be shifted a few yards to the downstream
side of the constrained resource? This would mean that no constraint time would be
saved, while the company would still be investing in the additional quality review staff
person and related equipment. In this case, there is no change in throughput, but an
increase in expenses and invested capital. Consequently, merely moving the quality
workstation to one side or the other of the constrained resource can have a significant
impact on corporate profitability, either up or down.
