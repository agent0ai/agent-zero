## Strategic Publication Planning

### Pre-Writing Considerations

Effective academic publishing begins before the first word is written. Strategic planning ensures that research outputs achieve maximum impact and reach appropriate audiences.

**Research Communication Goals**
- Define primary and secondary audiences
- Identify key messages and contributions
- Establish publication timeline and milestones
- Align with career development objectives
- Consider funding agency requirements

**Multi-Paper Strategy Development**
For comprehensive studies generating multiple publications:
- Map research questions to distinct papers
- Assign lead authors for each manuscript
- Establish non-overlapping scopes and audiences
- Create publication sequence and dependencies
- Set realistic deadlines with buffer time

**Ethical Clearance Verification**
Before beginning any writing:
- Confirm ethical approval from all relevant review boards
- Verify compliance with institutional policies
- Ensure participant consent covers publication
- Review data sharing and confidentiality requirements

## Journal Selection and Targeting

### Early Target Journal Selection

**Strategic Importance**
Selecting a target journal early in the writing process provides crucial advantages:
- Tailors writing style to specific readership
- Guides appropriate level of background information
- Informs methodological detail requirements
- Shapes discussion and implication focus
- Determines formatting and reference standards

**Journal Research Process**

**Step 1: Audience Analysis**
- Review journal "Aims and Scope" sections
- Analyze recent publications for content patterns
- Identify core readership expertise levels
- Assess geographical and institutional diversity
- Evaluate interdisciplinary vs. specialized focus

**Step 2: Impact and Reach Assessment**
- Journal Impact Factor and citation metrics
- Altmetric scores and social media presence
- Open access policies and accessibility
- Publication frequency and turnaround times
- Editorial board composition and expertise

**Step 3: Compatibility Evaluation**
- Manuscript type acceptance (original research, reviews, etc.)
- Word count and format requirements
- Statistical and methodological standards
- Ethical and reporting guideline adherence
- Special issue opportunities

### Journal Hierarchy and Backup Planning

**Primary Target Selection**
- Highest impact journal matching research scope
- Strong editorial board expertise alignment
- Reasonable acceptance probability
- Appropriate timeline for career needs

**Secondary and Tertiary Options**
