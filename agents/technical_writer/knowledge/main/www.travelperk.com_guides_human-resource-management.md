As organizations continue to recognize the value of human capital, the role of human resource managers has become increasingly important. But what is a Human Resource manager, and what are their key duties and responsibilities?Human resource managers wear many hats and are responsible for a wide range of human resources (HR) activities, including recruitment, training and development, managing employee compensation and benefits, compliance, and performance management.Here, we take a deep look at what a Human Resource manager does and the critical role they play in a business. We delve into what human resource management is and the core responsibilities of an HR Manager.

## What is Human Resource Management?

Human resource management (HRM) is the practice of managing an organization’s human capital—otherwise known as employees. It involves the **recruitment, selection, training, and development of existing employees and new staff** to ensure that the organization has the right people in the right roles to achieve its objectives.HRM also includes activities such as performance management, compensation and benefits administration, employee relations, and workforce and strategic planning. HR professionals are responsible for **creating and enforcing policies and procedures** that comply with employment laws and regulations, as well as **promoting a positive company culture** that values diversity, equity, and inclusion, and employee well-being.Since HRM directly impacts employee engagement, productivity, and retention, and therefore a company’s success, effective HRM is critical. HR managers must have strong communication skills, leadership skills, sound decision-making competencies, and work experience in several administrative functions to enable them to balance the needs of employees with business objectives.With the [rise in remote working practices](https://www.travelperk.com/blog/working-from-home-statistics/) and [hybrid working models](https://www.travelperk.com/blog/top-hybrid-work-trend-stats-from-global-companies-us/), effective HRM has become even more important in the rapidly changing business landscape. Plus, as companies face the challenge of talent shortages, major digital transformations, and an aging workforce, talented HR professionals are increasingly sought after to lead human resources departments and help businesses thrive.

## What does a Human Resource Manager do?

HR managers are responsible for overseeing all aspects of human resources within an organization, including recruiting, hiring, managing training and development programs, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations.They’re also in charge of employee engagement strategies, developing employee surveys, and implementing best practices. Developing and implementing best practice policies and procedures, managing employee performance and employee benefits programs, and overseeing the recruitment and selection of new employees are also key HR manager duties.Since HR managers are responsible for maintaining compliance with the relevant industry regulations and standards, as well as internal policies, they must also stay up-to-date with changes in labor laws and regulations, as well as trends and best practices in HR management.In addition, HR managers must be able to work effectively with other heads of department and senior management, as well as with external stakeholders, including job candidates, labor unions, labor relations specialists, and legal and regulatory bodies.
