## 3. CAP Theorem in Database Design {#cap-theorem}

### Understanding CAP Theorem

> The CAP theorem states that it is impossible to guarantee all three desirable properties—Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance—simultaneously in a distributed system with data replication.

#### The Three Properties

##### Consistency (C)
- **Definition**: All nodes see the same data simultaneously
- **Guarantee**: Every read receives the most recent write
- **Impact**: Users always see up-to-date information

##### Availability (A)
- **Definition**: System remains operational and responsive
- **Guarantee**: Every request receives a response
- **Impact**: System continues functioning despite failures

##### Partition Tolerance (P)
- **Definition**: System continues operating despite network failures
- **Guarantee**: Functionality maintained during communication breakdowns
- **Impact**: Resilience to network partitions and node failures

### CAP Theorem Database Categories

#### CP Databases (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)

**Characteristics:**

- **Cons**: Range queries require multiple shards

##### Directory-based Sharding
- **Method**: Maintain lookup service for shard locations
- **Example**: Separate service maps keys to shards
- **Pros**: Flexible, can rebalance easily
- **Cons**: Additional complexity, potential bottleneck

#### Implementation Considerations
- **Shard Key Selection**: Choose keys that distribute data evenly
- **Cross-shard Queries**: Minimize operations spanning multiple shards
- **Rebalancing**: Plan for adding/removing shards
