## How to write a technical writer job description

To ensure that your most complex information is easy for users to understand, you need to hire a strong technical writer. This means crafting a strong technical writer job description. Your post should introduce the culture and values of your organization using clear, direct language. It should also tell candidates what to expect if they’re hired, and how their work will have a positive impact on your organization.    

 The lists of objectives, responsibilities, and qualifications for the role should have no more than six bullets in each section. Review these lists carefully, removing any item that doesn’t accurately reflect the requirements for the technical writer.
