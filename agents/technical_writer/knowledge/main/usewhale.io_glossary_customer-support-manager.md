## What is a Customer Support Manager (CSM)?

There is some flexibility around the job title of customer support manager. A CSM may or may not be a people manager, depending on how the role is classified. Some customer support manager roles might be better classified as customer support agents, responsible for traditional inbound troubleshooting or order help, while others may be specific to certain accounts and have a more proactive role.

Still others may be leading teams of agents and may not interact with customers at all. However, the end goal of all CSM roles (regardless of actual responsibilities) is to enable great customer experiences in order to increase the likelihood of customer retention.‍

Note: A customer support manager may also be called customer success manager, customer service manager, or even customer service representative depending on the company. Even within these titles, certain roles and responsibilities may differ.

But what exactly sets a CSM apart from other roles, and why are they so crucial to a business’s success?

## The difference between a customer support manager and a customer success manager

While both roles focus on customer happiness, they approach it from different angles. A customer support manager deals primarily with [customer service and support](https://usewhale.io/templates/operations-templates/customer-service-process-template/), managing a team that handles inquiries, complaints, and technical support. Their role is reactive, providing solutions and information when customers face problems.

In contrast, a customer success manager is proactive. They focus on customer relationship management, onboarding, and ensuring that customers achieve their desired outcomes with the product or service. This role is more about fostering long-term customer engagement and maximizing the value customers get from their relationship with your company.

If you’ve met with [Whale’s](https://usewhale.io/blog/6-things-you-didnt-know-about-whale/) Head of Customer Success, Stino, you’ll understand exactly what we’re talking about.

## Main responsibilities of a customer support manager

A customer support manager’s responsibilities are diverse, but the core duties can be summarized as follows:

### Strategy and improvement

CSMs regularly analyze performance data to identify trends and areas for improvement. This might involve updating training methods, adjusting policies, or introducing new technologies to enhance service quality.

### Managing support

A CSM oversees the customer support department’s operations, ensuring the team is efficient, effective, and aligned with company goals. They train and mentor staff, manage schedules, and ensure that customer service targets are consistently met.

### Resolving complex issues

While frontline agents handle everyday inquiries, CSMs often step in when issues become complex or escalate. Their expertise enables them to manage difficult situations smoothly, often turning a potentially negative experience into a positive one.

### Team leadership and management

A great customer lead recruits, [trains](https://usewhale.io/blog/benefits-of-employee-training/), and mentors support team members, ensuring the team is well-equipped to handle customer queries.

### Performance monitoring

CSMs track and analyze team performance against customer support metrics to identify areas for improvement.

### Customer interaction oversight

They ensure that all customer interactions meet the company’s standards of quality and service.

### Feedback between customers and the business

By collecting and analyzing customer feedback, CSMs contribute to product development and enhancement discussions.

### Documenting customer service SOPs

By being at the core of the customer’s needs and by understanding the business, a CSM is perfectly positioned to bridge the gap. Harnessing this collective wisdom into [customer service SOPs](https://usewhale.io/blog/customer-service-sops/) is a key part of the role.

## Key Customer Support Metrics

To excel in their role, a CSM must stay on top of specific metrics that gauge the effectiveness of customer support efforts.

### Customer success metrics

* Customer churn: This is the number of customers who leave the product in search of a better alternative or for other reasons.
* Expansion MRR: This the monthly revenue figure for current customers.

### Customer support metrics

* Customer satisfaction score (CSAT): Measures customer satisfaction with a service or support interaction.
* Net promoter score (NPS): Gauges customer loyalty and the likelihood of customers recommending the company.
* First response time (FRT): The average time it takes for a customer to receive the first response to their query.
* Resolution time: How long it takes to resolve a customer’s issue fully.

## The business benefits of having a CSM

Integrating a Customer Support Manager into your business structure can yield significant benefits.

For instance, companies with dedicated customer support managers see an improvement in customer retention rates by up to 15%, according to a study by the Harvard Business Review.

Here’s how a CSM can transform your business landscape:

* Enhanced customer satisfaction: Quick, effective solutions to problems boost customer satisfaction and loyalty.
* Increased efficiency: Streamlined support processes reduce costs and improve service delivery, enhancing overall business efficiency.
* Better feedback for improvement: Insightful customer feedback collected and analyzed by CSMs can drive product improvements and innovation.

## Why is customer success is essential?

According to a Microsoft report, 90% of Americans consider customer service a crucial factor in choosing which companies to do business with.

The role of a customer support manager is integral to fostering a culture of customer-centricity in a business. By ensuring that customer support runs smoothly and effectively, a CSM not only boosts customer satisfaction but also aligns support activities with broader business objectives.

The investment in a good customer support manager is an investment in the future of your business, unlocking new levels of growth and customer engagement. Whether handling a crisis or steering regular queries, a CSM ensures your customers always have a go-to point for outstanding service.
