## Core Binary Exploitation Concepts

### Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

#### Buffer Overflows
**Definition**: Writing data beyond allocated memory boundaries, potentially overwriting critical program data

**Types**:
- **Stack-based Overflows**: Overwriting return addresses and local variables
- **Heap-based Overflows**: Corrupting heap metadata and adjacent allocations
- **Off-by-one Errors**: Single-byte overflows with significant impact
- **Integer Overflows**: Arithmetic operations exceeding data type limits

**Exploitation Techniques**:
- Return address overwriting for control flow hijacking
- Function pointer corruption for arbitrary code execution
- Structured exception handler (SEH) overwriting on Windows
- Virtual function table (vtable) corruption in C++ applications

#### Format String Vulnerabilities
**Definition**: Misuse of format specifiers in printf-family functions allowing arbitrary memory access

**Common Format Specifiers**:
- `%s` - String pointer dereference
- `%x` - Hexadecimal value extraction
- `%n` - Write number of bytes printed to memory location
- `%p` - Pointer value disclosure

**Exploitation Methods**:
- Memory disclosure through format string reading
- Arbitrary memory writes using `%n` specifier
- Stack frame manipulation and control flow alteration
- ASLR bypass through memory leak exploitation

#### Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities
**Definition**: Accessing memory locations after they have been freed, leading to undefined behavior

**Exploitation Scenarios**:
- Heap spraying to control freed memory contents
- Function pointer hijacking through freed objects
- Type confusion attacks in object-oriented languages
- Double-free vulnerabilities for heap metadata corruption

### Advanced Exploitation Techniques

#### Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)
**Concept**: Chaining existing code fragments (gadgets) to execute arbitrary operations

**ROP Chain Construction**:
1. **Gadget Discovery**: Finding useful instruction sequences ending in `ret`
2. **Chain Planning**: Designing sequence of operations to achieve objectives
3. **Stack Preparation**: Arranging gadget addresses on the stack
4. **Execution Trigger**: Initiating ROP chain through vulnerability exploitation

**Advanced ROP Techniques**:
- **ret2libc**: Jumping directly to library functions
- **ret2plt**: Using Procedure Linkage Table entries
- **ret2syscall**: Direct system call invocation
- **SROP (Sigreturn-oriented Programming)**: Using sigreturn for register control

#### Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP)
**Evolution**: Using indirect jumps instead of returns for more flexible control flow

**Advantages over ROP**:
- More gadget availability in modern binaries
- Better evasion of ROP-specific mitigations
- Functional programming paradigm implementation
- Advanced control flow manipulation capabilities

#### Heap Exploitation Techniques

**Heap Spraying**:

### Stack Canaries
**Protection**: Detecting stack buffer overflows through canary values

**Types**:

**Bypass Strategies**:
- **Canary Leaks**: Disclosing canary values through vulnerabilities
