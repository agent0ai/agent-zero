Preface

 

The accounting department is a cost center. It does not directly generate revenues
but, rather, provides a fixed set of services to the rest of the company, and is asked
to do so at the lowest possible cost. Consequently, the accounting staff is called on
to process transactions, write reports, create new processes, or investigate old
ones—while doing so as an ever-shrinking proportion of total corporate expenses.

This cost-based environment is a very difficult one for most accountants, for
their training is primarily in accounting rules and regulations, rather than in how to
run a very specialized department in a cost-effective manner. They find a few ideas
for improvements from attending seminars or perusing accounting or management
magazines, but there is no centralized source of information for them to consult that
itemizes a wide array of possible improvements. Hence the need for the seventh
edition of Accounting Best Practices, which contains 408 accounting best prac-
tices, 40 of which are new to this edition.

This book is compiled from the author’s lengthy experience in setting up and
operating a number of accounting departments, as well as by providing consulting
services to other companies. Accordingly, it contains a blend of best practices from
a wide variety of accounting environments, ranging from small partnerships to
multibillion-dollar corporations. This means that not all of the best practices
described within these pages will be useful in every situation—some are designed
to provide quick and inexpensive, incremental improvements, while others are
groundbreaking events requiring six-figure investments (or more) and months of
installation time. Consequently, each chapter includes a table that notes the ease,
duration, and cost of implementation for every best practice within it. These tables
separate best practices into a number of subcategories, and also contain a reference
number that is useful for locating the main text for each best practice within the
chapter. All best practices are also noted in summary form in the appendix.

Chapter 1

 

Overview of Best Practices

A chief executive officer (CEO) spends months deciding on a corporate strategy.
The plan probably includes a mix of changes in products, customers, and markets,
as well as demands for increased efficiencies or information in a number of existing
areas. The CEO then hands off the plan to a group of managers who are quite
capable of implementing many of the changes, but who scratch their heads over
how to squeeze greater efficiencies or information out of existing departments in
order to meet their strategic goals. This is where best practices come into play.

A best practice is really any improvement over existing systems, though some
consultants prefer to confine the definition to those few high-end and very
advanced improvements that have been successfully installed by a few world-
class companies. This book uses the broader definition of any improvement over
existing systems, since the vast majority of companies are in no position, in terms
of either technological capabilities, monetary resources, or management skill, to
make use of truly world-class best practices. Using this wider definition, a best
practice can be anything that increases the existing level of efficiency, such as
switching to blanket purchase orders, signature stamps, and procurement cards to
streamline the accounts payable function. It can also lead to improved levels of
reporting for use by other parts of the company, such as throughput analyis, target
costing, or direct costing reports in the costing function. Further, it can reduce the
number of transaction errors, by such means as automated employee expense
reports, automated bank account deductions, or a simplified commission calcula-
tion system. By implementing a plethora of best practices, a company can greatly
improve its level of efficiency and information reporting, which fits nicely into the
requirements of most strategic plans.

One can go further than describing best practices as an excellent contributor to
the fulfillment of a company’s strategy, and even state that a strategy does not have
much chance of success unless best practices are involved. The reason best
practices have such a large impact on overall efficiencies is that they unleash a
large number of excess people who can then work on other strategic issues, as well
as reduce a company’s cash requirements, releasing more cash for investment in
strategic targets. In addition, some best practices link company functions more
closely together, resulting in better overall functionality—this is a singular
improvement when a company is in the throes of changes caused by
strategy shifts. Further, best practices can operate quite well in the absence of


2 Overview of Best Practices

a strategic plan. For example, any department manager can install a variety of best
practices with no approval or oversight from above, resulting in a multitude of
beneficial changes. Thus, best practices are a linchpin of the successful corporate
strategy and can also lead to improvements even if they are not part of a grand
strategic vision.

The scope of this book does not encompass all of the best practices that a
company should consider, only those used by the accounting department. This area
is especially susceptible to improvement through best practices, since it is heavily
procedure driven. When there are many procedures, there are many opportunities
to enhance the multitude of procedure steps through automation, simplification,
elimination of tasks, error-proofing, and outsourcing. Thus, of all the corporate
functions, this is the one that reacts best to treatment through best practices.

Chapter 2 covers a variety of issues related to the implementation of best
practices, such as differentiating between incremental and reengineering changes,
circumstances under which best practices are most likely to succeed, and how to
plan and proceed with these implementations. Most important, there is a discussion
of the multitude of reasons why a best practice implementation can fail, which is
excellent reading prior to embarking on a new project, in order to be aware of all
possible pitfalls. The chapter ends with a brief review of the impact of best
practices on employees. This chapter is fundamental to the book, for it serves as the
groundwork on which the remaining chapters are built. For example, if you are
interested in modifying the general ledger account structure for use by an activity-
based costing system, it is necessary to first review the implementation chapter to
see how any programming, software package, or interdepartmental issues might
impact the project.

Chapters 3 through 18 each describe a cluster of best practices, with a
functional area itemized under each chapter. For example, Chapter 9 covers a
variety of improvements to a company’s commission calculation and payment
systems, while Chapter 18 is strictly concerned with a variety of payroll-stream-
lining issues related to the collection of employee time information, processing it
into payments, and distributing those payments. Chapter 14 is a catchall chapter. It
covers a variety of general best practices that do not fit easily into other, more
specific chapters. Examples of these best practices are the use of process centering,
online reporting, and creating a contract-terms database. Chapters 3 through 18 are
the heart of the book since they contain information related to over 400 best
practices.

For Chapters 3 through 18, there is an exhibit near the beginning that shows
the general level of implementation cost and duration for each of the best practices
in the chapter. This information gives the reader a good idea of which best practices
to search for and read through, in case these criteria are a strong consideration. For
each chapter, there are a number of sections, each one describing a best practice.
There is a brief description of the problems it can fix, as well as notes on how it can
be implemented, and any problems you may encounter while doing so. This
chapter layout is designed to give the reader a quick overview of the best practices

that are most likely to make a significant impact on a functional area of the
accounting department.

The appendix lists all of the best practices in each of the preceding chapters.
This list allows the reader to quickly find a potentially useful best practice. It is then
a simple matter to refer back to the main text to obtain more information about each
item.

This book is designed to assist anyone who needs to either improve the
efficiency of the accounting department, reduce its error rates, or provide better
information to other parts of a company. The best practices noted on the following
pages will greatly assist in attaining this goal, which may be part of a grand
strategic vision or simply a desire by an accounting manager to improve the
department. The layout of the book is extremely practical: to list as many best
practices as possible, to assist the reader in finding the most suitable ones, and to
describe any implementation problems that may arise. In short, this is the perfect
do-it-yourself fix-it book for the manager who likes to tinker with the accounting
department.

How to Use Best Practices

This chapter is about implementing best practices. It begins by describing the
various kinds of best practices and goes on to cover those situations where they are
most likely to be installed successfully. The key components of a successful best
practice installation are also noted. When planning to add a best practice, it is also
useful to know the ways in which the implementation can fail, so there is a lengthy
list of reasons for failure. Finally, there is a brief discussion of the impact of change
on employees and the organization. Only by carefully considering all of these
issues in advance can one hope to achieve a successful best practice implementa-
tion that will result in increased levels of efficiency in the accounting department.

Types of Best Practices

This section describes the two main types of best practices, each one requiring
considerably different implementation approaches.

The first type of best practice is an incremental one. This usually involves
either a small modification to an existing procedure or a replacement of a procedure
that is so minor in effect that it has only a minimal impact on the organization, or
indeed on the person who performs the procedure. The increased level of efficiency
contributed by a single best practice of this type is moderate at best, but this type is
also the easiest to install, since there is little resistance from the organization. An
example of this type of best practice is using a signature stamp to sign checks (see
Chapter 3); it is simple, cuts a modest amount of time from the check preparation
process, and there will be no complaints about its use. However, only when this
type of best practice is used in large numbers is there a significant increase in the
level of efficiency of accounting operations.

The second type of best practice involves a considerable degree of
reengineering. This requires the complete reorganization or replacement of


6 How to Use Best Practices

an existing function. The level of change is massive, resulting in employees
either being laid off or receiving vastly different job descriptions. The level of
efficiency improvement can be several times greater than the old method it is
replacing. However, the level of risk matches the reward, for this type of best
practice meets with enormous resistance and consequently is at great risk of
failure. An example of this type of best practice is eliminating the accounts
payable department in favor of having the receiving staff approve all payments at
the receiving dock (see Chapter 3); it involves the elimination of many jobs and
is an entirely new approach to paying suppliers. A single best practice imple-
mentation of this sort can reap major improvements in the level of accounting
efficiency.

Thus, given the considerable number and size of the differences between the
incremental and reengineering best practices, it is necessary to first determine into
which category a best practice falls before designing a plan for implementing it.
Given the difficulty of implementation for a reengineering project, it may even be
necessary to delay implementation or intersperse a series of such projects with
easier incremental projects in order to allow employees to recover from the
reengineering projects.

The Most Fertile Ground for Best Practices

Before installing any best practice, it is useful to review the existing environment to
see if there is a reasonable chance for the implementation to succeed. The
following bullet points note the best environments in which best practices not
only can be installed but also have a fair chance of continuing to succeed:

¢ If benchmarking shows a problem. Some organizations regularly compare
their performance levels against those of other companies, especially those
with a reputation for having extremely high levels of performance. If there is a
significant difference in the performance levels of these other organizations
and the company doing the benchmarking, this can serve as a reminder that
continuous change is necessary in order to survive. If management sees and
heeds this warning, the environment in which best practices will be accepted is
greatly improved.

¢ Ifmanagement has a change orientation. Some managers have a seemingly
genetic disposition toward change. If an accounting department has such a
person in charge, there will certainly be a drive toward many changes. If
anything, this type of person can go too far, implementing too many projects
with not enough preparation, resulting in a confused operations group whose
newly revised systems may take a considerable amount of time to untangle.
The presence of a detail-oriented second-in-command is very helpful for
preserving order and channeling the energies of such a manager into the most
productive directions.


Planning for Best Practices 7

¢ Ifthe company is experiencing poor financial results. If there is a significant
loss, or a trend in that direction, this serves as a wake-up call to management,
which, in turn, results in the creation of a multitude of best practices projects. In
this case, the situation may even go too far, with so many improvement projects
going on at once that there are not enough resources to go around, resulting in the
ultimate completion of few, if any, of the best practices.

¢ If there is new management. Most people who are newly installed as
managers of either the accounting department or (better yet) the entire organi-
zation want to make changes in order to leave their marks on the organization.
Though this can involve less effective practice items like organizational changes
or a new strategic direction, it is possible that there will be a renewed focus on
efficiency that will result in the implementation of new best practices.

In short, as long as there is a willingness by management to change and a good
reason for doing so, then there is fertile ground for the implementation of a
multitude of best practices.

Planning for Best Practices

A critical issue for the success of any best practices implementation project is an
adequate degree of advance planning. The following bullet points describe the key
components of a typical best practices implementation plan:

¢ Capacity requirements. Any project plan must account for the amount of
capacity needed to ensure success. Capacity can include the number of people,
computers, or floor space that is needed. For example, if the project team
requires 20 people, then there must be a planning item to find and equip a
sufficient amount of space for this group. Also, a project that requires a
considerable amount of programming time should reserve that time in advance
with the programming staff to ensure that the programming is completed on
time. Further, the management team must have a sufficient amount of time
available to properly oversee the project team’s activities. If any of these
issues are not addressed in advance, there can be a major impact on the success
of the implementation.

¢ Common change calendar. If there are many best practices being imple-
mented at the same time, there is a high risk that resources scheduled for one
project will not be available for other projects. For example, a key software
developer may receive independent requests from multiple project teams to
develop software, and cannot satisfy all the requests. To avoid this, use a
single change calendar, so that planned changes can be seen in the context of
other changes being planned. The calendar should be examined for conflicts
every time a change is made to it, and also be made available for general
review, so that all project teams can consult it whenever needed.


8 How to Use Best Practices

¢ Contingencies. Murphy’s Law always applies, so there should be contingen-
cies built into the project plan. For example, if the project team is being set up
in a new building, there is always a chance that phone lines will not be
installed in time. To guard against this possibility, there should be an
additional project step to obtain some cellular phones, which will supply
the team’s communications needs until the phone lines can be installed.

¢ Dependencies. The steps required to complete a project must be properly
sequenced so that any bottleneck steps are clearly defined and have sufficient
resources allocated to them to ensure that they are completed on time. For
example, a project-planning person cannot set up the plan if there is no
project-planning software available and loaded into the computer. Conse-
quently, this step must be completed before the planning task can commence.

¢ Funding requirements. Any project requires some funding, such as the
purchase of equipment for the project team or software licenses or employee
training. Consequently, the project plan must include the dates on which
funding is expected, so that dependent tasks involving the expenditure of
those funds can be properly planned.

¢ Review points. For all but the smallest projects, there must be control points at
which the project manager has a formal review meeting with those people who
are responsible for certain deliverables. These review points must be built into
the plan, along with a sufficient amount of time for follow-up meetings to
resolve any issues that may arise during the initial review meetings.

¢ Risk levels. Some best practices, especially those involving a large proportion
of reengineering activities, run a considerable risk of failure. In these cases, it
is necessary to conduct a careful review of what will happen if the project fails.
For example, can the existing system be reinstituted if the new system does not
work? What if funding runs out? What if management support for the project
falters? What if the level of technology is too advanced for the company to
support? The answers to these questions may result in additional project steps
to safeguard the project, or to at least back it up with a contingency plan in case
the project cannot reach a successful conclusion.

¢ Total time required. All of the previous planning steps are influenced by one
of the most important considerations of all—how much time is allocated to the
project. Though there may be some play in the final project due date, it is
always unacceptable to let a project run too long, since it ties up the time of
project team members and will probably accumulate extra costs until it is
completed. Consequently, the project team must continually revise the
existing project plan to account for new contingencies and problems as
they arise, given the overriding restriction of the amount of time available.

The elements of planning that have just been described will all go for naught if
there is not an additional linkage to corporate strategy at the highest levels. The
reason is that although an implementation may be completely successful, it may


Timing of Best Practices 9

not make any difference, and even be rendered unusable, if corporate strategy calls
for a shift that will render the best practice obsolete. For example, a fine new
centralized accounts payable facility for the use of all corporate divisions is not of
much use if the general corporate direction is to spin off or sell all of those
divisions. Thus, proper integration of low-level best practices planning with high-
level corporate planning is required to ensure that the correct projects are
completed.

Given the large number of issues to resolve in order to give an implementation
project a reasonable chance of success, it is apparent that the presence of a manager
who is very experienced in the intricacies of project planning is a key component of
an effective project team. Consequently, the acquisition of such a person should be
one of the first steps to include in a project plan.

This section described in general terms the key components of a project plan
that must be considered in order to foresee where problems may arise in the course
of an implementation. We now proceed to a discussion of the impact of time on the
success of a best practices implementation.

Timing of Best Practices

The timing of a best practice implementation, the time it takes to complete it, and
the pacing of installations have a major impact on the likelihood of success.

The timing of an implementation project is critical. For example, an installa-
tion that comes at the same time as a major deliverable in another area will receive
scant attention from the person who is most responsible for using the best practice,
since it takes a distant second place to the deliverable. Also, any project that comes
on the heels of a disastrous implementation will not be expected to succeed, though
this problem can be overcome by targeting a quick and easy project that results in a
rapid success—and that overcomes the stigma of the earlier failure. Further, proper
implementation timing must take into account other project implementations going
on elsewhere in the company or even in the same department, so there is no conflict
over project resources. Only by carefully considering these issues prior to
scheduling a project will a best practice implementation not be impacted by
timing issues.

In addition to timing, the time required to complete a project is of major
importance. A quick project brings with it the aura of success, a reputation for
completion, and a much better chance of being allowed to take on a more difficult
and expensive project. Alternatively, a project that impacts lots of departments or
people, or that involves the liberal application of cutting-edge technology, has a
major risk of running for a long time; and the longer the project, the greater the risk
that something will go wrong, objections will arise, or that funding will run out.
Thus, close attention to project duration will increase the odds of success.

Also, the concept of pacing is important. This means that a best practices
implementation will be more likely to succeed if only a certain number of


10 How to Use Best Practices

implementations are scheduled for a specific area. For example, if corporate
management wants to install several dozen different types of best practices in five
different departments, the best implementation approach is to install one best
practice in a single department and then move on to a different department. By
doing so, the staff of each department has a chance to assimilate a single best
practice, which involves staff training, adjustments to policies and procedures, and
modifications of work schedules. Otherwise, if they are bombarded with multiple
best practices at the same time or one after another, there is more likelihood that all
of the best practices will fail or at least not achieve high levels of performance for
some time. In addition, the staff may rebel at the constant stream of changes and
refuse to cooperate with further implementations.

Implementing Best Practices

The actual implementation of any best practice requires a great degree of careful
planning, as noted earlier. However, planning is not enough. The implementation
process itself requires a number of key components in order to ensure a successful
conclusion. This section discusses those components.

One of the first implementation steps for all but the simplest best practice
improvements is to study and flowchart the existing system about to be improved.
By doing so, one can ascertain any unusual requirements that are not readily
apparent and that must be included in the planning for the upcoming implementa-
tion. Though some reengineering efforts do not spend much time on this task, on
the grounds that the entire system is about to be replaced, the same issue still
applies—there are usually special requirements, unique to any company, that must
be addressed in any new system. Accordingly, nearly all implementation projects
must include this critical step.

Another issue is the cost-benefit analysis. This is a compilation of all the costs
required to both install and maintain a best practice, which is offset against the
benefits of doing so. These costs must include project team payroll and related
expenses, outside services, programming costs, training, travel, and capital
expenditures. This step is worth a great deal of attention, for a wise manager
will not undertake a new project, no matter how cutting edge and high profile it
may be, if there is not a sound analysis in place that clearly shows the benefit of
moving forward with it.

Another cost-benefit analysis consideration is that the installation of a cluster
of interconnected best practices can result in an exceptionally large payback. For
example, if a payroll department employed a paymaster to distribute paychecks, it
might find that it could not eliminate this position solely through the use of direct
deposit, because unbanked employees could not take advantage of electronic
payments; instead, only by also implementing paycards for the unbanked employ-
ees could the company switch entirely away from manual payments, thereby
allowing it to actually eliminate the paymaster position and maximize its savings.


Implementing Best Practices 11

A second consideration is that some existing processes will not achieve high levels
of efficiency improvement if only a single link in the process is replaced with a best
practice; instead, a wholesale process replacement is needed in order to achieve
maximum profit enhancement. However, when considering the installation of best
practice clusters, be aware that this can have an adverse impact on employees,
whose morale may suffer from having been burdened with an unending stream of
best practices projects. Sometimes, spreading out implementation projects over
time, with scheduled breaks, will result in more complete success of individual
projects, thereby resulting in a better overall impact on the success of a cluster of
improvements—it just takes longer to complete.

Yet another implementation issue is the use of new technology. Though there
may be new devices or software on the market that can clearly improve the
efficiency of a company’s operations, and perhaps even make a demonstrative
impact on a company’s competitive situation, it still may be more prudent to wait
until the technology has been tested in the marketplace for a short time before
proceeding with an implementation. This is a particular problem if there is only one
supplier offering the technology, especially if that supplier is a small one or one
with inadequate funding, with the attendant risk of going out of business. In most
cases, the prudent manager will elect to use technology that has proven itself in the
marketplace, rather than using the most cutting-edge applications.

Of great importance to most best practice implementations is system testing.
Any new application, unless it is astoundingly simple, carries with it the risk of
failure. This risk must be tested repeatedly to ensure that it will not occur under
actual use. The type of testing can take a variety of forms. One is volume testing, to
ensure that a large number of employees using the system at the same time will not
result in failure. Another is feature testing, in which test transactions that test the
boundaries of the possible information to be used are run through the system. Yet
another possibility is recovery testing—bringing down a computer system sud-
denly to see how easy it is to restart the system. All of these approaches, or others,
depending on the type of best practice, should be completed before unleashing a
new application on employees.

One of the last implementation steps before firing up a new best practice is to
provide training to employees in how to run the new system. This must be done as
late as possible, since employee retention of this information will dwindle rapidly
if not reinforced by actual practice. In addition, this training should be hands-on
whenever possible, since employees retain the most information when training is
conducted in this manner. It is important to identify in advance all possible users of
a new system for training, since a few untrained employees can result in the failure
of a new best practice.

A key element of any training class is procedures. These must be completed,
be reviewed, and be made available for employee use not only at the time of
training, but also at all times thereafter, which requires a good manager to oversee
the procedure creation and distribution phases. Procedure writing is a special skill
that may require the hiring of technical writers, interviewers, and systems analysts


12 How to Use Best Practices

to ensure that procedures are properly crafted. The input of users into the accuracy
of all procedures is also an integral step in this process.

Even after the new system has been installed, it is necessary to conduct a
postimplementation review. This analysis determines if the cost savings or
efficiency improvements are in the expected range, what problems arose during
the implementation that should be avoided during future projects, and what issues
are still unresolved from the current implementation. This last point is particularly
important, for many managers do not follow through completely on all the stray
implementation issues, which inevitably arise after a new system is put in place.
Only by carefully listing these issues and working through them will the employ-
ees using the new system be completely satisfied with how a best practice has been
installed.

An issue that arises during all phases of a project implementation is commu-
nications. Since there may be a wide range of activities going on, many of them
dependent on each other, it is important that the status of all project steps be
continually communicated to the entire project team, as well as to all affected
employees. By doing so, a project manager can avoid such gaffes as having one
task proceed without knowing that due to changes elsewhere in the project, the
entire task has been rendered unnecessary. These communications should not just
be limited to project plan updates but should also include all meeting minutes in
which changes are decided on, documented, and approved by team leaders. By
paying attention to this important item at every step of an implementation, the
entire process will be completed much more smoothly.

As described in this section, a successful best practice implementation nearly
always includes a review of the current system, a cost-benefit analysis, responsible
use of new technology, system testing, training, and a postimplementation review,
with a generous dash of communications at every step.

Best Practice Duplication

It can be a particularly difficult challenge to duplicate a successful best practice
when opening a new company facility, especially if expansion is contemplated in
many locations over a short time period. The difficulty with best practice
duplication is that employees in the new locations are typically given a brief
overview of a best practice and told to “go do it.” Under this scenario, they have
only a sketchy idea of what they are supposed to do, and so create a process that
varies in some key details from the baseline situation. To make matters worse,
managers at the new location may feel that they can create a better best practice
from the start, and so create something that differs in key respects from the
baseline. For both reasons, the incidence of best practice duplication failure is high.

To avoid these problems, a company should first be certain that it has
accumulated all possible knowledge about a functioning best practice—the forms,
policies, procedures, equipment, and special knowledge required to make it work


Why Best Practices Fail 13

properly—and then transfer this information into a concise document that can
be shared with new locations. Second, a roving team of expert users must be
commissioned to visit all new company locations and personally install the new
systems, thereby ensuring that the proper level of experience with a best practice is
brought to bear on a duplication activity. Finally, a company should transfer the
practitioners of best practices to new locations on a semipermanent basis to ensure
that the necessary knowledge required to make a best practice effective over the
long term remains on-site. By taking these steps, a company can increase its odds
of spreading best practices throughout all of its locations.

A special issue is the tendency of a new company location to attempt to
enhance a copied best practice at the earliest opportunity. This tendency frequently
arises from the belief that one can always improve upon something that was created
elsewhere. However, these changes may negatively impact other parts of the
company’s systems, resulting in an overall reduction in performance. Conse-
quently, it is better to insist that new locations duplicate a best practice in all
respects and use it to match the performance levels of the baseline location before
they are allowed to make any changes to it. By doing so, the new locations must
take the time to fully utilize the best practice and learn its intricacies before they
can modify it.

Why Best Practices Fail

There is a lengthy list of reasons that a best practice installation may not succeed,
as noted in the following bullet points. The various reasons for failure can be
grouped into a relatively small cluster of primary reasons. The first is lack
of planning, which can include inadequate budgeting for time, money, or
personnel. Another is the lack of cooperation by other entities, such as the
programming staff or other departments that will be impacted by any changes.
The final, and most important, problem is that there is little or no effort made to
prepare the organization for change. This last item tends to build up over time as
more and more best practices are implemented, eventually resulting in the total
resistance by the organization to any further change. At its root, this problem
involves a fundamental lack of communication, especially to those people who are
most impacted by change. When a single implementation is completed without
informing all employees of the change, this may be tolerated, but a continuous
stream of them will encourage a revolt. In alphabetical order, the various causes of
failure are noted as follows:

¢ Alterations to packaged software. A very common cause of failure is
that a best practice requires changes to a software package provided by a
software supplier; after the changes are made, the company finds that the
newest release of the software contains features that it must have and so it
updates the software—wiping out the programming changes that were made


14

How to Use Best Practices

to accommodate the best practice. This problem can also arise even if there is
only a custom interface between the packaged software and some other
application needed for a best practice, because a software upgrade may alter
the data accessed through the interface. Thus, alterations to packaged software
are doomed to failure unless there is absolutely no way that the company will
ever update the software package.

Custom programming. A major cause of implementation failure is that the
programming required to make it a reality either does not have the requested
specifications, costs more than expected, arrives too late, is unreliable—or all
of the above! Since many best practices are closely linked to the latest
advances in technology, this is an increasingly common cause of failure. To
keep from being a victim of programming problems, never attempt to
implement the most “bleeding-edge” technology, because it is the most
subject to failure. Instead, wait for some other company to work out all of
the bugs and make it a reliable concept, and then proceed with the imple-
mentation. Also, it is useful to interview other people who have gone through
a complete installation to see what tips they can give that will result in a
smoother implementation. Finally, always interview any other employees
who have had programming work done for them by the in-house staff. If the
results of these previous efforts were not acceptable, it may be better to look
outside of the company for more competent programming assistance.

Inadequate preparation of the organization. Communication is the key to a
successful implementation. Alternatively, no communication keeps an orga-
nization from understanding what is happening; this increases the rumors
about a project, builds resistance to it, and reduces the level of cooperation that
people are likely to give to it. Avoiding this issue requires a considerable
amount of up-front communication about the intentions and likely impact of
any project, with that communication targeted not just at the impacted
managers but also at all impacted employees, and to some extent even the
department or corporation as a whole.

Intransigent personnel. A major cause of failure is the employee who either
refuses to use a best practice or who actively tries to sabotage it. This type of
person may have a vested interest in using the old system, does not like change
in general, or has a personality clash with someone on the implementation
team. In any of these cases, the person must be won over through good
communication (especially if the employee is in a controlling position) or
removed to a position that has no impact on the project. If neither of these
actions is successful, the project will almost certainly fail.

Lack of control points. One of the best ways to maintain control over any
project is to set up regular review meetings, as well as additional meetings to
review the situation when preset milestone targets are reached. These meet-
ings are designed to see how a project is progressing, to discuss any problems
that have occurred or are anticipated, and to determine how current or


Why Best Practices Fail 15

potential problems can best be avoided. Without the benefit of these regular
meetings, it is much more likely that unexpected problems will arise, or that
existing ones will be exacerbated.

¢ Lack of funding. A project can be canceled either because it has a significant
cost overrun that exceeds the original funding request or because it was
initiated without any funding request in the first place. Either approach results
in failure. Besides the obvious platitude of “don’t go over budget,” the best
way to avoid this problem is to build a cushion into the original funding
request that should see the project through, barring any unusually large extra
expenditures.

¢ Lack of planning. A critical aspect of any project is the planning that goes
into it. If there is no plan, there is no way to determine the cost, number of
employees, or time requirements, nor is there any formal review of the
inherent project risks. Without this formal planning process, a project is
very likely to hit a snag or be stopped cold at some point prior to its timely
completion. On the contrary, using proper planning results in a smooth
implementation process that builds a good reputation for the project manager
and thereby leads to more funding for additional projects.

¢ Lack of postimplementation review. Though it is not a criterion for the
successful implementation of any single project, a missing postimplemen-
tation review can cause the failure of later projects. For example, if such a
review reveals that a project was completed in spite of the inadequate
project-planning skills of a specific manager, it might be best to use a
different person in the future for new projects, thereby increasing his or her
chances of success.

¢ Lack of success in earlier efforts. If a manager builds a reputation for not
successfully completing best practices projects, it becomes increasingly
difficult to complete new ones. The problem is that no one believes that a
new effort will succeed and so there is little commitment to doing it. Also,
upper management is much less willing to allocate funds to a manager who
has not developed a proven track record for successful implementations. The
best way out of this jam is to assign a different manager to an implementation
project, one with a proven track record of success.

¢ Lack of testing. A major problem for the implementation of especially large
and complex projects, especially those involving programming, is that they
are rushed into production without a thorough testing process to discover and
correct all bugs that might interfere with or freeze the orderly conduct of work
in the areas they are designed to improve. There is nothing more dangerous
than to install a wonderful new system in a critical area of the company, only
to see that critical function fail completely due to a problem that could have
been discovered in a proper testing program. It is always worthwhile to build
some extra time into a project budget for an adequate amount of testing.


16

How to Use Best Practices

Lack of top management support. If a project requires a large amount of
funding or the cooperation of multiple departments, it is critical to have the
complete support of the top management team. If not, any required funding
may not be allocated, while there is also a strong possibility that any objecting
departments will be able to sidetrack it easily. This is an especially common
problem when the project has no clear project sponsor at all—without a
senior-level manager to drive it, a project will sputter along and eventually
fade away without coming anywhere near completion.

Relying on other departments. As soon as another department’s cooperation
becomes a necessary component of a best practice installation, the chances of
success drop markedly. The odds become even smaller if multiple depart-
ments are involved. The main reason is that there is now an extra manager
involved, who may not have the commitment of the accounting manager to
make the implementation a success. In addition, the staff of the other
department may influence their manager not to help out, while there may
also be a problem with the other department not having a sufficient amount of
funding to complete its share of the work. For example, an accounting
department can benefit greatly at period-end if the warehouse is using cycle
counting to keep inventory accuracy levels high, since there is no need for a
physical inventory count. However, if the warehouse does not have the extra
staff available to count inventory, the work will not be done, no matter how
badly the accounting staff wants to implement this best practice.

Too many changes in a short time. An organization will rebel against too
much change if it is clustered into a short time frame. The reason is that
change is unsettling, especially when it involves a large part of people’s job
descriptions, so that nearly everything they do is altered. This can result in
direct employee resistance to further change, sabotaging new projects, a
work slowdown, or (quite likely) the departure of the most disgruntled
workers. This problem is best solved by planning for lapses between
implementation projects to let the employees settle down. The best way
to accomplish this lag between changes without really slowing down the
overall schedule of implementation is to shift projects around in the
accounting department, so that no functional area is on the receiving end
of two consecutive projects.

The primary reason for listing all of these causes of failure is not to discourage

the reader from ever attempting a best practice installation. On the contrary, this
allows you to prepare for and avoid all roadblocks on the path to ultimate
implementation success.

A useful approach for dealing with many of the problems spotlighted in this

section is to use a rapid-results initiative (RRI). An RRI is a mini-project
intended to create results similar to a full-scale best practices project but for a
more limited area and within a very short time period. By undertaking an RRI,


The Impact of Best Practices on Employees 17

the project team can spot problems faster than would be the case with a major
initiative, and then transfer its findings to the main project, thereby increasing the
chances of success for the main project. In short, an RRI is designed to locate and
correct pitfalls that could otherwise cause major problems for a full-scale best
practices implementation.

Another approach to avoiding best practice failure is to spend a considerable
amount of time examining logical deficiencies in a proposed best practice. Since
the person proposing a best practice installation is more likely to be blind to its
possible downsides, it is better to have another person review the proposal for these
deficiencies; better yet, have a subject-matter expert examine the proposal for
problems. When a project will involve other departments, including the staffs of
those departments in the logical deficiencies review will inherently work to gain
their acceptance if their issues can be overcome as part of the implementation
process.

The Impact of Best Practices on Employees

The impact of best practices on employees is significant. In the short run, there is an
overwhelming feeling of discontent, because any kind of change makes employees
nervous about what the impact will be on their jobs. Admittedly, a primary purpose
of using best practices is to reduce the payroll expense in the accounting
department, or at least to handle an increased workload with the same number
of employees. Consequently, employees have a reason to be concerned.

There are several ways to deal with employee concerns. One is to create a
standard policy of rolling all displaced employees onto a project team that will be
used to implement even more best practices. This approach tends to attract the best
employees to the project team, but also has the disadvantage of eventually
displacing so many employees that there are too many people staffing the
implementation team. The opposite approach is to be up front about projected
changes to employee jobs and to give a generous amount of both notice and
severance pay to those people who will be displaced. Given the realities of paying
extra money to departing employees and the need for well-staffed implementation
teams, the recommended approach is somewhere in the middle—to retain a few of
the best employees to run new projects, which reduces the amount of severance
that must be paid out to departing employees.

The other problem, which is more of a long-run issue, is communications.
Even after the initial round of layoffs, there will be a continued emphasis on
constantly improving the accounting department’s processes. These changes
cannot take place in a vacuum. Instead, the implementation team must carefully
research the costs and benefits of each prospective best practice, discuss the issue
with those employees who are most knowledgeable about how any changes will
impact the organization as a whole, and rely to a considerable extent on their advice
in regard to whether there should be any implementation at all, and if so, how the


18 How to Use Best Practices

best practice should be modified to fit the organization’s particular circumstances.
Only by making the maximum use of employees’ knowledge and by paying close
attention to their opinions and fears can an implementation team continually
succeed in installing a series of best practices.

Thus, communication is the key—both in handling employee departures in the
short term, while the accounting department is reducing its staffing levels to match
greater levels of efficiency, and in the long run, when employee cooperation is
crucial to continued success.

Summary

This chapter has given an overview of the situations in which best practices
implementations are most likely to succeed, what factors are most important to the
success or failure of an implementation, and how to successfully create and follow
through on an implementation project. By following the recommendations made in
this chapter, not only those regarding how to implement but also those regarding
what not to do, a manager will have a much higher chance of success. With this
information in hand, one can now confidently peruse the remaining chapters,
which are full of best practices. The reader will be able to select those practices
having the best chance of a successful implementation, based on the specific
circumstances pertaining to each manager, such as the funding, time available, and
any obstacles, such as entrenched employees or a corporate intransigence pertain-
ing to new projects.

Accounts Payable
Best Practices

The accounts payable function is the most labor intensive of all the accounting
functions and is therefore an excellent source of labor savings if the correct best
practices can be implemented. The basic process in most companies is to receive
three types of information from three sources—an invoice from the supplier, a
purchase order from the purchasing department, and a proof of receipt from the
receiving department. The accounts payable staff then matches all three documents
to ensure that a prospective payment is authorized and that the underlying goods
have been received, and then pays the bill. The process is labor intensive—partially
because there is such a large amount of matching to do but also because the three
documents almost never match. Either the purchase order quantities or prices do
not match what the supplier is charging or the amount received does not match the
quantities on the other two documents. Because of these inaccuracies, the amount
of labor required to issue a payment can be extraordinarily high.

The best practices in this chapter fall into a few main categories, most of them
designed to reduce the matching work. One category attempts to consolidate the
number of invoices arriving from suppliers, thereby shrinking the paperwork from
this source—typical best practices in this area are using procurement cards and
shrinking the number of suppliers. Another category tries to reduce or eliminate the
number of receiving documents. Typical best practices in this area are substituting
occasional audits for ongoing matching of receiving documents, as well as directly
entering receipts into the computer system. Finally, another category reduces the
number of purchase orders that must be matched. Typical best practices in this area
include using blanket purchase orders and automating three-way matching. Other
solutions to the matching problem involve going away from the traditional
matching process entirely, by using payments based solely on proof of receipt.
It is not possible to use all of these best practices together, since some are mutually
exclusive—one must be careful in choosing the correct best practices.

The number of best practices in the accounts payable area indicates that this
function is ripe for improvements. However, some best practices require a large
investment of money or time, as noted in the chart in the next section, so the person
doing the improving should verify that resources are available before embarking
on an implementation.

Implementation Issues for Accounts Payable Best Practices

This section notes a number of issues related to the implementation of each best
practice. The reader should peruse Exhibit 3.1 to ensure that the effort required to
install a best practice is in agreement with the available constraints. For example,
automating expense reporting is listed as requiring a long implementation period
and being moderately expensive (all because of the programming required). If the
reader has a large staff of traveling employees who constantly submit expense
reports, this may be a viable option, despite the projected implementation barriers.
However, if only a few expense reports are submitted, then perhaps this is a best
practice that should be passed over in favor of more practical opportunities.

Exhibit 3.1 lists all of the best practices in this chapter. Next to the best
practices are ratings for estimates of the cost to completely install each best
practice. The last column shows the duration of implementation, which can be an
issue for anyone looking for quick results. Any large programming projects are
assumed to have long implementation durations.

Be careful to not just select “quick hits” from Exhibit 3.1. Though these best
practices are certainly worth the effort of installing, it is important to remember that
some of the most difficult items on the list can have the largest payback.
Accordingly, it is best to review the list in detail and assemble a set of best
practices that provide for a combination of quick and easy victories, while also
allowing for solid, long-term improvements that will impact the accounts payable
function’s levels of efficiency and effectiveness.

3-1 Pay Based on Receiving Approval Only

The accounts payable process is one of the most convoluted of all the processes
that a company can adopt, irrespective of the department. First, it requires the
collection of information from multiple departments—purchase orders from the
purchasing department, invoices from suppliers, and receiving documents from
the receiving department. The process then involves matching these documents,
which almost always contain exceptions, and then tracking down someone either
to approve exceptions or to at least sign the checks, which must then be mailed to
suppliers. The key to success in this area is to thoroughly reengineer the entire
process by eliminating the paperwork, the multiple sources of information, and the

additional approvals. The only best practice that truly addresses the underlying
problems of the accounts payable process is paying based on receipt.

To pay based on receipt, you must first do away with the concept of having an
accounts payable staff that performs the traditional matching process. Instead, the
receiving staff checks to see if there is a purchase order at the time of receipt. If
there is, the computer system automatically pays the supplier. Sounds simple? It is
not. A company must have several features installed before the concept will
function properly. The main issue is having a computer terminal at the receiving
dock. When a supplier shipment arrives, a receiving person takes the purchase
order number and quantity received from the shipping documentation and punches
it into the computer. The computer system checks against an online database of
open purchase orders to see if the shipment was authorized. If so, the system
automatically schedules a payment to the supplier based on the purchase order
price, which can be sent by wire transfer. If the purchase order number is not in the
database, or if there is no purchase order number at all, the shipment is rejected at
the receiving dock. Note that the accounts payable staff takes no part whatsoever in
this process—everything has been shifted to a simple step at the receiving location.
The process is shown graphically in Exhibit 3.2.

Before laying off the entire accounts payable staff and acquiring such a
system, there are several problems to overcome. They are as follows:

¢ Train suppliers. Every supplier who sends anything to a company must be
trained to include the purchase order number, the company’s part number, and
the quantity shipped on the shipping documentation, so this information can
be punched into the computer at the receiving location. The information can
be encoded as bar codes to make the data-entry task easier for the receiving
employees. Training a supplier may be difficult, especially if the company
purchases only a small quantity of goods from the supplier. To make it
worthwhile for the supplier to go to this extra effort, it may be necessary to
concentrate purchases with a smaller number of suppliers to give each one a
significant volume of orders.

¢ Alter the accounting system. The traditional accounting software is not
designed to allow approvals at the receiving dock. Accordingly, a company
will have to reprogram the system to allow the reengineered process to be
performed. This can be an exceptionally major undertaking, especially if the
software is constantly being upgraded by the supplier—every upgrade will
wipe out any custom programming that the company may have created.

¢ Prepare for miscellaneous payments. The accounts payable department will
not really go away because there will always be stray supplier invoices of
various kinds arriving for payment that cannot possibly go through the
receiving dock, such as subscription payments, utility bills, and repair
invoices. Accordingly, the old payment system must still be maintained,
though at a greatly reduced level, to handle these items.

¢ Pay without a supplier invoice. One of the key aspects of the reengineered
process is paying based on the information in the purchase order, rather than
the information in the supplier’s invoice. To do so, one must have a database
of all the tax rates that every supplier would charge, so that the company’s
computer system can automatically include these taxes in the invoice pay-
ments. Also, there will sometimes be discrepancies between the purchase
order prices and quantities paid, versus those expected by suppliers, so an
accounts payable staff must be kept on hand to correspond with suppliers to
reconcile these issues.


3-2 Reduce Required Approvals 25

The preceding bullet points reveal that there is a wide array of problems that
must first be overcome before the dramatic improvements of this new process can
be realized. However, for a company with a large accounts payable staff, this can
be a highly rewarding system to install, for the savings realized can be the
elimination of the majority of the accounts payable department.

Cost: PIF Installation time: 3 €3

3-2 Reduce Required Approvals

The accounts payable process is typically a long one. Part of the problem is that
many accounting systems require a manager’s signature (or those of several
managers!) on a supplier invoice before it can be paid. Though it is reasonable to
have such a requirement if there is no purchase order for the invoice, many systems
require the signature even if there is already a purchase order (which is, in effect, a
form of prior approval). Also, most accounting systems require a manager’s
signature on unapproved invoices, no matter how small the invoice may be. The
result of these common approval procedures is that the accounts payable staff
delivers invoices to managers for signatures and then waits until the documents are
returned before proceeding further with the payment process. If the manager is not
available to sign an invoice, then it sits; if the manager loses the invoice (a common
occurrence), the invoice is never paid, resulting in an angry supplier who must send
a fresh copy of the invoice for a second pass through the dangerous shoals of the
company’s approval process. This is a clearly inefficient process, both lengthy and
likely to annoy suppliers. What can be done?

A superb best practice for any company to implement is to limit approvals to a
single event or document and, wherever possible, to limit this approval to a period prior
tothereceipt ofthe supplierinvoice. Forexample, an authorized signature ona purchase
order should be sufficient overall approval to pay an invoice. After all, if the signature
was good enough to authorize the initial purchase of the item or service, shouldn’t the
same signature be sufficient approval for the payment of the supplier’ s bill? In addition,
by shifting the approval to the purchase order, we avoid having the accounts payable
staff track down someone after the supplier’s invoice has been received, which
effectively chops time from the overall accounts payable process. Another variation
istousea signature on the purchase requisition, which comes before the purchase order.
As long as either document is signed by an authorized person and sent to the accounts
payable staff in advance, it does not matter which document is used as authorization.
The key is to use a single authorization, before the supplier sends an invoice.

One reason so many companies require multiple approvals, both at the time of
purchasing and at the time of payment, is that they do not have a sufficient degree
of control over the authorization process. For example, there may not be any real
check of authorization signatures when purchase requisitions are converted into
purchase orders, nor might there be any required signature when purchase orders


26 Accounts Payable Best Practices

are issued to suppliers. In addition, the signature stamp used to sign checks may not
be properly controlled. In all these cases, if there were tight control over the
authorization used, there would only be a need for a single authorization. For
example, there should be an audit of all purchase orders to ensure that every one of
them has been signed, that every signature is by an authorized person, and that the
person signing is authorized to purchase what was ordered. This level of control
requires continual internal audits to ensure that the control point is working, as well
as continual follow-up and training of employees so that they know precisely how
the control system is supposed to work. Only by instituting this degree of control
over authorizations can a company reduce the number of approvals to a minimum.

Using tight control over approvals that are given early in the accounts payable
process results in a shorter processing cycle and fewer delays.

Cost: gy Installation time:

3-3 Use Negative Assurance for Invoice Approvals

One of the most significant problems for the accounts payable staff is the
continuing delay in receiving approvals of supplier invoices from authorized
employees throughout the company. Invoices tend to sit on employee desks as
low-priority items, resulting in constant reminders by the accounting staff to turn in
documents, as well as late payments and missed early-payment discounts.

This universal problem can be avoided through the use of negative assurance.
Under this approval system, invoice copies are sent to authorizing employees, and
are automatically paid when due unless the employees tell the accounts payable
staff not to issue payment. By focusing only on those invoices that may be
incorrect, the accounting staff can process the vast majority of all submitted
invoices without cajoling anyone to submit an approved document.

The process can be streamlined even further by digitizing an incoming invoice
and e-mailing it to the authorizing employee. By doing so, employees can be
reached even when they are off-site, as long as they check their e-mail on a regular
basis. By linking these transmissions to workflow software, the accounting staff
can designate how long an invoice can wait in a recipient’s e-mail box before it is
automatically routed to another authorized person, thereby ensuring that someone
will see every invoice and raise a red flag if a potential problem exists.

3-4 Designate Approval Stamp Positioning

When the payables staff sends out a supplier invoice to a manager for approval, a
common technique is to stamp the invoice with an approval stamp, on which the


3-6 Use Procurement Cards 27

manager is supposed to write his or her initials to indicate approval, as well as the
date, and possibly an account code to which the invoice is to be charged. This can
be a problem when the payables staff inadvertently stamps that portion of an
invoice that is to be detached and sent back to the supplier along with payment (the
remittance advice). When the stamp is located on the remittance advice, it is no
longer possible for the external auditors to verify that an invoice has been properly
approved, unless the payables staff takes the additional time to make a photocopy
of the remittance and attach it to the company’s copy of the invoice.

To avoid these problems, part of the payables staff training should include a
discussion of where the approval stamp should be located on an invoice. If there
are any instances where the stamp has been made over a remittance advice, the
matter should be brought to the attention of the accounts payable manager for
follow-up with the person who stamped the document.

3-5 Base Approvals on Supplier Invoicing History

In a manufacturing department that uses a just-in-time materials flow, a common
technique is to certify suppliers for the accuracy of their processes and the quality of
their products. If they pass a company’s standards, they are allowed to deliver goods
to the company without passing through a rigorous receiving inspection—in some
cases, they may deliver directly to the company’s production lines.

This same approach is possible in the treatment of supplier invoices. If there is
a history of having received perfect invoices from suppliers, designate their
invoices as not requiring a detailed three-way match by the payables staff. Instead,
an occasional audit of their invoices by the internal audit department will be
sufficient. This is a particularly valuable best practice if it can be applied to high-
volume suppliers who send a large number of invoices. If enough invoices can be
removed from the labor-intensive three-way matching process, the payables staff
may find that it requires much less time in total to process payments.

3-6 Use Procurement Cards

Consider the number of work steps required to process a payment to a supplier:
receiving paperwork, sorting and matching it, entering data into a computer,
routing invoices through the organization for approvals, expediting those invoices
that have early-payment discounts, creating month-end accruals, setting up files on
new suppliers in the computer and the filing system, processing checks, obtaining
check signatures, mailing payments, and filing away check copies. Now consider


28 Accounts Payable Best Practices

how many purchases are so small that the cost of all these activities exceeds the
cost of the purchase. In many instances, one quarter or more of all payment
transactions fall into this category.

The answer to this problem is not to find a more efficient way to process the
supplier invoices but to change the way in which these items or services are
purchased. Instead of using a purchase order or check to purchase something,
one should instead use a procurement card. A procurement card, also known as a
purchasing card, is simply a credit card with a few extra features. The card is issued to
those people who make frequent purchases, with instructions to keep on making the
same purchases, but to do so with the card. This eliminates the multitude of supplier
invoices by consolidating them all into a single monthly credit card statement.

As there is always a risk of having a user purchase extraneous items with a
credit card, including cash advances or excessively expensive purchases, the
procurement card adds a few features to control precisely what is purchased. For
example, it can have a limitation on the total daily amount purchased, the total
amount purchased per transaction, or the total purchased per month. It may also
limit purchases to a specific store or to only those stores that fall into a specific
Standard Industry Classification (SIC code) category, such as a plumbing supply
store and nothing else. These built-in controls effectively reduce the risk that
procurement cards will be misused.

Once the credit card statement arrives, it may be too jumbled, with hundreds of
purchases, to determine the expense accounts to which all the items are to be
charged. To help matters, a company can specify how the credit card statement is to
be sorted by the credit card processing company; it can list expenses by the location
of each purchase, by Standard Industrial Classification code, or by dollar amount,
as well as by date. It is even possible to receive an electronic transmission of the
credit card statement so that a company can do its own sorting of expenses. The
purchasing limitations and expense statement changes are the key differences
between a regular credit card and a procurement card.

Another feature provided by those entities that offer procurement cards is
“Level II” data; this includes a supplier’s minority supplier status, incorporated
status, and its tax identification number. Another option to look into when
reviewing the procurement card option is the existence of “Level III” reporting,
which includes such line-item details as quantities, product codes, product
descriptions, and freight and duty costs—in short, the bulk of the information
needed to maintain a detailed knowledge of exactly what is being bought with a
company’s procurement cards. Most major national suppliers of credit cards can
supply Level II or Level III data.

Though this best practice may appear to be nirvana to many organizations, the
following issues must be carefully considered in order to ensure that the program
operates properly:

¢ Card misuse. When procurement cards are handed out to a large number of
employees, there is always the risk that someone will abuse the privilege and


3-6 Use Procurement Cards 29

use up valuable company funds on incorrect or excessive purchases. There are
several ways to either prevent this problem or to reduce its impact. One
approach is to hand out the procurement cards only to the purchasing staff,
who can use them to pay for items for which they would otherwise issue a
purchase order; however, this does not address the large quantity of very small
purchases that other employees may make, so a better approach is a gradual
rollout of procurement cards to those employees who have shown a continu-
ing pattern of making small purchases. Also, the characteristics of the
procurement card itself can be altered, either by limiting the dollar amount
of purchases per transaction, per time period, or even per department.

¢ Spending on special items. The use of a procurement card can actually
interfere with existing internal procedures for the purchase of some items,
rendering those systems less efficient. For example, an automated materials
planning system for the inventory can issue purchase orders to suppliers with
no manual intervention; adding inventory items to this situation that were
purchased through a different methodology can interfere with the integrity of
the database, requiring more manual reconciliation of inventory quantities.
Thus, procurement cards are not always a good idea when buying inventory
items. Also, capital purchases typically have to go through a detailed review
and approval process before they are acquired; since a procurement card offers
an easy way to buy smaller capital items, it represents a simple way to bypass
the approval process. Thus, they are not a good choice for capital purchases.

¢ Dealing with users of the old system. Some employees will not take to the
new procurement card approach, if only because they are used to the old
system. This can cause headaches for both the purchasing and accounting
departments, since they must deal with both the old system and the new one in
combination. It may be impossible to completely eliminate the old purchase
order system in some cases (if only because of company politics), so a good
alternative is to charge to those departments using the old system the fully
burdened cost of each transaction that does not use a procurement card. Since
this burdened cost, which includes the cost of all the processing steps noted at
the beginning of this section, can easily exceed $100 per transaction, it
becomes a very effective way to shift usage toward the procurement card
solution.

¢ Summarizing general ledger accounts. The summary statements that are
received from the credit card processor will not contain as many expense line
items as are probably already contained within a company’s general ledger
(which tends to slice-and-dice expenses down into many categories). For
example, the card statements may only categorize by shop supplies, office
supplies, and shipping supplies. If so, then it is best to alter the general ledger
accounts to match the categories being reported through the procurement
cards. This may also require changes to the budgeting system, which probably
mirrors the accounts used in the general ledger.

Accounts Payable Best Practices

Purchases from unapproved suppliers. A company may have negotiated
favorable prices from a few select suppliers in exchange for making all of its
purchases for certain items from them. It is a simple matter to ensure that
purchases are made through these suppliers when the purchasing department
is placed in direct control of the buying process. However, once purchases are
put in the hands of anyone with a procurement card, it is much less likely that
the same level of discipline will occur. Instead, purchases will be made from a
much larger group of suppliers. Though not an easy issue to control, the
holders of procurement cards can at least be issued a “preferred supplier
yellow pages,” which lists those suppliers from whom they should be buying.
Their adherence to this list can be tracked by comparing actual purchases to
the yellow pages list and giving them feedback about the issue.

Paying sales and use taxes. Occasionally, a state sales tax auditor will arrive
on a company’s doorstep, demanding to see documentation that proves it
has paid a sales tax on all items purchased. This is not easy to do when
procurement cards are used, not only because there may be a multitude of
poorly organized supplier receipts but also because the sales tax noted on a
credit card payment slip shows only the grand total sales tax paid, rather than
the sales tax for each item purchased; this is an important issue, for some items
are exempt from taxation, which will result in a total sales tax that appears to
be too low in comparison to the total dollar amount of items purchased. One
way to alleviate this problem is to obtain sales tax exemption certificates from
all states with which a company does business; employees then present the
sales tax exemption number whenever they make purchases so that there is no
doubt at all—no sales taxes have been paid. Then the accounting staff can
calculate the grand total for the use tax (which is the same thing as the sales
tax, except that the purchaser pays it to the state, rather than to the seller) to
pay, and forward this to the appropriate taxing authority. An alternative is to
“double bag” tax payments, which means that the company pays the full use
tax on all procurement card purchases, without bothering to spend the time
figuring out which sales taxes have already been paid. This is a safe approach
from a tax audit perspective and may not involve much additional cost if the
total of all procurement card purchases is small.

Though the problems noted here must be addressed, the problems are minor in

relation to the possible benefits. Here are the main attractions of this best practice:

Extend payment period. The payables staff can contact a supplier, just
before an invoice is due for payment, and see whether the supplier will accept
payment of the invoice with a procurement card. By doing so, the company
has just extended its payment interval (depending on the cutoff period for the
procurement card), since it can now wait an additional period until the
monthly procurement card statement arrives before making a payment.


3-6 Use Procurement Cards 31

¢ Fewer accounting transactions. Some of the accounts payable staff may be
redirected to other tasks, because the number of transactions will drop considerably.

¢ Fewer invoice reviews and signatures. Managers no longer have to review a
considerable number of invoices for payment approval, nor do they have to
sign so many checks addressed to suppliers.

¢ No cash advances. Whenever an employee asks for a cash advance, the
accounting staff must create a manual check for that person, record it in the
accounting records, and ensure that it is paid back by the employee. This can
be a very time-consuming process in proportion to the generally meager
advances given to employees. A credit card can avoid this entire process,
because employees can go to an automated teller machine and withdraw cash,
which will appear in the next monthly card statement from the issuing bank—
no check issuances required. Of course, this benefit applies only if those
employees needing cash advances are the same ones with access to a
procurement card.

¢ Fewer petty-cash transactions. If employees have procurement cards, they
will no longer feel compelled to buy items with their own cash and then ask for
a reimbursement from the company’s petty-cash fund.

¢ Fewer purchasing transactions. A whole range of purchasing activities are
reduced in volume, including contacting suppliers for quotes, creating and
mailing purchase orders, resolving invoicing differences, and closing out orders.

¢ Reduced supplier list. The number of active vendors in the purchasing
database can be greatly reduced, which allows the buying staff to focus on
better relations with the remaining ones on the list.

¢ Reduced mailroom volume. Even the mailroom will experience a drop in
volume, since there will be far fewer incoming supplier invoices and outgoing
company checks.

A procurement card is easy to implement (just hand it out to employees), but
keep a significant difficulty in mind: The banks that issue credit cards must expend
extra labor to set up a procurement card for a company, since each one must be
custom designed. Consequently, they prefer to issue procurement cards only to
those companies that can show a significant volume of credit card business—
usually at least $1 million per year. This volume limitation makes it difficult for a
smaller company to use procurement cards. This problem can be partially avoided
by using a group of supplier-specific credit cards. For example, a company can sign
up for a credit card with its office supply store, another with its building materials
store, and another with its electrical supplies store. This results in a somewhat
larger number of credit card statements per month, but they are already sorted by
supplier, so they are essentially a “poor man’s procurement card.”

32 Accounts Payable Best Practices

3-7 Use a Ghost Card

Most companies have their employees make purchases with various types of credit
cards, for which they are reimbursed by the company. This approach reduces the
risk of liability for excessive purchases made by employees, though employees are
put at risk of not being reimbursed in a timely manner for possibly substantial
company-related charges. A common alternative is to issue individual company-
sponsored purchasing cards to selected employees, who are authorized to make a
variety of purchases within certain restrictive limits.

The trouble in both cases is that employees may circumvent centralized
purchasing rules, which prevents the company from taking advantage of bulk
pricing deals with a small number of preferred suppliers. Also, in the case of
company-sponsored cards, a relatively high level of control is generally applied, so
that they are given to only a small minority of employees, thereby making it more
difficult to roll out the comprehensive use of credit cards for small-dollar
purchases. Finally, purchases with these cards may be applicable to a variety
of departments, requiring a detailed and sometimes difficult month-end reconcili-
ation to determine which purchases are to be charged to each department.

An alternative that resolves some of these issues is the ghost card. A ghost
card does not involve the use of an actual card. Instead, each department is given its
own ghost card number, with which it can make a variety of purchases that will be
charged back to that department. By centralizing such purchases with a single
account number, payment processing is made considerably easier. Also, since the
company is directly responsible for all purchases made with the ghost card, it will
be billed by the card provider in a timely and predictable manner (as opposed to the
use of personal cards, where expenses may not appear until several months later).

Another use for the ghost card is to provide it to preferred suppliers for
ongoing use, with each supplier being given a unique ghost card number; the
suppliers automatically charge it when purchases are made by employees. This
greatly streamlines the more common approach of charging the plastic card of
whichever company employee shows up to make a purchase.

Another advantage of the ghost card is that some suppliers are now providing
direct input of charge information into corporate enterprise resource planning
(ERP) systems, so that purchases can be charged directly to the correct department
with no manual data entry needed.

3-8 Negotiate Procurement Card Rebates
Ifa company has shifted a large part of its purchases to procurement cards, then this
represents a significant revenue source for procurement card companies. Once a

company has built up a sufficient volume of procurement card business, it is in a
position to negotiate for better terms with its procurement card supplier. One of the


3-10 Split Payables Processing Based on Discounts 33

best such deals is to obtain a rebate percentage that is tied to the volume of
payments made with a specific procurement card.

This best practice is not available for smaller procurement card programs, but
if a company can surpass about $5 million per year in card purchases, then it can
bargain for a small rebate percentage that can increase as its purchases increase.
Initial rebates are extremely small but can reach 0.5 percent for very large
procurement card programs.

Cost: SF Installation time:
3-9 Route All Invoices Directly to Accounts Payable

The accounts payable department is constantly faced with suppliers complaining
that they are not being paid on time, usually because the payables staff has never
received the suppliers’ invoices. Instead, suppliers send invoices directly to the per-
son who originally ordered from the supplier, and this person has never forwarded
the invoice to accounts payable. This is a particular problem when the person
placing the order does so with a verbal order, so there is no written record of the
approval—suppliers know this could be a problem, so they send the invoice directly
to the person placing the order, in hopes of having him or her approve it on the spot.

To avoid this missing invoice conundrum, remind suppliers to always send all
invoices directly to the accounts payable department, which can then immediately
log them into the payables computer system for timely payment. Suppliers should
always include on an invoice either the authorizing purchase order number or the
name of the person who authorized the order, so the payables staff can then process
the related invoice approval. If suppliers persist in sending invoices elsewhere than
to the accounts payable department, then the payables staff should log in these
invoices as they arrive from elsewhere in the company, and have the accounting
manager contact his or counterpart in the supplier’s billing department to discuss
the issue. If necessary, the problem can be escalated through higher levels of
management. An alternative approach is to send these invoices back to the supplier
(without first logging them in), with a note regarding the proper delivery procedure
so that the supplier is forced to address the invoice properly in order to be paid. Yet
another approach is to instruct the mailroom staff to forward all incoming supplier
invoices directly to the accounts payable department, even if they are addressed to
someone elsewhere in the organization.

3-10 Split Payables Processing Based on Discounts

When a supplier offers an early payment discount, the terms offered are nearly
always so advantageous that the payables staff must pay early. However, these


34 Accounts Payable Best Practices

invoices tend to be lost amidst the sea of invoices that arrive in the mail every day,
resulting in late processing and therefore no discount taken.

To avoid this problem, examine invoices for discounts at the point of receipt,
and set aside all invoices offering early payment discounts. This batch of invoices
can then follow a higher-speed processing track that uses expedited data entry and
approvals. If these invoices are processed manually, use negative approvals (will
be paid unless the approver says otherwise) to ensure that early payment is not
delayed by a late approval.

If all invoices are digitized at the point of receipt, these invoices can be flagged
with a special index code. If prioritized invoices are being approved with a work
flow management system, then set them up to be bounced to a different person for
approval if they are not approved within a very short time frame by the primary
approver.

3-11 Adopt a Standard Invoice Numbering Convention

A major cause of duplicate payments is multiple copies of the same supplier
invoice being entered in the computer system, but with slight variations on the
invoice number that keep the computer from flagging them as duplicate invoices.
This is an especially common problem when suppliers issue invoices with
leading zeros, since one data-entry clerk may enter the zeros, while another may
ignore them. It also common for employee expense reports and a variety of
utility billings, since these documents have no invoice number. It also happens
when an original invoice is not paid on time, so the supplier floods the company
with extra copies of the invoice, hoping that one of the copies will eventually
be paid.

There is no perfect solution to this problem, but the basic approach is to adopt
a standard invoice numbering convention for the data-entry staff to follow, thereby
introducing some consistency into this aspect of invoice data entry. It can include
some of the following rules:

¢ Drop leading zeros. It is also possible to reverse this rule and always use
leading zeros, but the extra characters may overflow the computer field for
invoice numbers.

¢ Use the packing slip number. If the invoice contains no invoice number and
it is related to a physical delivery, then there should be a packing slip that
accompanied the delivery. If so, enter the packing slip number as the invoice
number. If a duplicate invoice arrives, it must still be matched to the packing
slip before payment is approved, so the packing slip number will be flagged by
the computer as a duplicate invoice number.


3-12 Automate Three-Way Matching 35

¢ Use an alternate document identifier. If an invoice contains no invoice
number but does have other tracking numbers, such as an internal indexing
number or a job number, then use this number instead.

¢ Use invoice date. A less foolproof alternative is to use the invoice date. This
approach can still result in duplicate payments, because suppliers may
legitimately issue more than one invoice on the same day, resulting in
such coding variations as MMDDYY-2 to signify that an invoice is the
second one received that has the same invoice date. If this alternative must be
used, then at least require that dates always be entered using the same format
every time, such as MMDDYY or MMDDYYYY.

¢ Avoid all punctuation and spaces. Some invoice numbers include slashes,
spaces, or dashes, which should be avoided. It is especially common for some
systems to add ‘“-IN” to the end of an invoice number, in order to signify that
this number is related to an invoice. If so, drop both the dash and the “IN” from
the invoice number.

The numbering convention should specify what type of alternate identifier to
use if there are several options available; otherwise, the data-entry staff may enter a
different number, resulting in a possible duplicate payment.

3-12 Automate Three-Way Matching

The three-way matching process is a manual one at most companies; that is, a clerk
matches a supplier invoice to a company purchase order and a receiving document
in order to ensure that the correct quantities (and costs) ordered are the same ones
received and billed. This is a painfully slow and inefficient process, given the large
number of documents involved, as well as the startling number of exceptions that
nearly always arise.

There are two ways to solve the problem. One is to dispense with three-way
matching entirely, which requires considerable reengineering of the accounts
payable process, as well as retraining of the receiving staff and even of suppliers.
This process was described in detail in best practice 3-1, “Pay Based on Receiving
Approval Only,” earlier in this chapter. Though the most elegant solution, it also
requires the most work to implement.

The second solution requires some software changes that may already be
available in the existing software package, with minimal changes to employee
procedures, while still resulting in efficiency improvements (though not on the
scale of the first solution). This best practice involves keeping the matching
process in its current form, but using the computer system to perform the matching
work. In order to automate three-way matching, all three documents must be


36 Accounts Payable Best Practices

entered into the computer system. This is easy for purchase orders, since most
companies already enter purchase orders directly into the computer in order to
track purchase orders through the manufacturing system. The next-easiest docu-
ment to enter is the receiving document, which can be either a bill of lading or a
packing slip. To do so, there should be a computer terminal at the receiving dock
that is linked to the main accounting database so that all information entered at the
dock is centrally stored. Finally, the supplier invoice must be entered into the
computer system—line by line. It is common enough to enter the supplier’s invoice
number and dollar amount into the computer system, but automated matching
requires the complete entry of all line items, quantities, and costs into the system,
which can be a considerable chore. Once this information is in the accounting
database, the computer system automatically matches the three documents (usually
using the purchase order number as the index), compares all line items, and
presents a summary of the matched documents to the accounting staff, showing
any variances between the matched documents. The accounting staff can then scan
the information and decide if the variances require further analysis or if they can be
paid as is. This best practice automates an existing manual process without a large
number of changes.

When deciding to use this best practice, it is useful to compare the savings
from eliminating manual matching to the added cost of keying all the documents
into the central database. There may also be an expense associated with installing
the matching software in the system, though it is usually an integral part of the
more advanced accounting packages. Low-end accounting packages do not
normally contain the automated matching feature.

3-13 Digitize Accounts Payable Documents

When accounting files are sent to the archives at the end of the year, the portion
taken up by the accounts payable documents usually exceeds that of all other
documents combined. For some companies with voluminous accounts payable
files, it is a major expense to remove all the paperwork, box it up and identify it,
and ship it off to a warehouse, from which it must be recalled occasionally for
various tasks. Digitizing the documents is a means of avoiding the expense of
archiving.

Digitizing a document means that it is laid on a scanner that converts the
document image into an electronic image that is stored in the computer database,
which can be recalled by anyone with access to the database. To digitize a
document, there should be a high-speed scanner available that is linked to a
computer network. Documents are fed into the scanner and assigned one or more
index numbers or codes so that it will be easy to recall the correct documents from
storage. For example, a document can be indexed by its purchase order number,


3-13 Digitize Accounts Payable Documents 37

date, or supplier number. A combination of several indexes is the best approach,
since one can still recall a document, even if one does not remember the first index
number. The document images are usually stored on an optical disk since it can
hold enormous amounts of storage space (and digitized documents take up a lot of
computer storage space). There will probably be many optical disks to provide a
sufficient amount of storage, so the disks are usually stored in a “jukebox,” which
gives the user access to all the data on all the storage disks. Users can then call up
the images from any terminal that is linked to the network where the information is
stored.

There are additional advantages to using digitization of documents. Besides
the reduced archiving costs, it is also possible to nearly eliminate the time needed
to access documents. With a traditional archiving system, older documents must be
requested from a warehousing facility that may require several days to deliver.
Even in-house documents may require several minutes to an hour to locate. If
customer service is important, and that service is linked to providing rapid access
to data, then digitizing documents allows a company to instantly satisfy customer
requests for documents by searching the computer files for them, no matter how old
the documents may be. Another advantage to using digitization is that it avoids
having to take out and replace files. Whenever someone removes a file and later
returns it, there is a risk that the file will be misplaced. Every time a file is
misplaced, it will be time consuming to find it again. By accessing documents
through a computer network, there is no need to take out or replace the document—
it is always sitting in the same storage location in the computer and cannot be lost.
Yet another advantage is that multiple users can access the same file at the same
time. Since it is a digital image, there is no reason why the computer cannot
potentially distribute a copy of the digital document to everyone who asks for it,
even if they all do so at the same time. A final advantage to digitization is that it can
be used to send an electronic file to a manager requesting an electronic approval
before a payment will be made. This approach keeps the digital document from
being lost during the approval process (a common problem when paper documents
are used for approvals), while instantly moving a digital approval through the
computer network, which also speeds up the transfer of approval information. In
short, there are a variety of good reasons for digitizing accounts payable docu-
ments, besides the most common one of eliminating archiving costs.

Though this best practice may seem like an ideal way to avoid lost files, reduce
archiving costs, shrink document search times, and allow for remote payment
approvals, there is one problem with it that bars most small companies from
installing it. The main issue is cost. The price of a high-speed scanner, computer,
and optical storage jukebox can easily exceed the cost savings from all the
advantages of this approach. The most cost-effective situations for digital storage
are when there is either a very high storage cost that can be eliminated (especially
common in high-rent accounting facilities where storage space is at a premium) or
the volume of transactions is so high that there is no practical alternative to storing,
filing, and moving all the paperwork. Consequently, digitizing accounts payable

documents is normally limited to larger companies or those with expensive storage
facilities.

3-14 Directly Enter Receipts into Computer

One portion of the accounts payable matching process is to physically match some
evidence of receipt, usually a packing slip or bill of lading, to a supplier invoice,
thereby proving that the goods being paid for were actually received. The receiving
documentation usually wends its way to the accounts payable staff over a period of
several days, and may be lost on the way. Once it arrives, the information may not
agree with the quantities being billed by the supplier. Consequently, the matching
of receiving documentation tends to be either delayed, missing, or cause for extra
reconciliation work by the accounting staff.

There are several solutions to the receiving paperwork problem. Two are
outlined in other sections of this chapter. One is using fully automated matching of
all accounts payable documents, which requires the input of all paperwork into the
computer—receiving information, the supplier invoice, and the purchase order—
so that the computer can automatically match the documents. This requires
complicated software that not all computer systems may have available. It is
described further in best practice 3-12, “Automate Three-Way Matching.”
Another solution is to have the receiving staff approve purchase orders for
payment based on what has just been received. This is a more radical approach
that is extremely efficient but that requires a complete redesign of the accounts
payable process. This section describes a less monumental change that can usually
be implemented by most accounting systems.

The alternative approach is to enter receipts directly into the computer system,
rather than forwarding receiving documents to the accounting department for
manual matching to the supplier invoice. This approach has the advantage of
instant communication of receipts to the accounting staff, since an entry into the
accounting database at the receiving dock will be instantly transmitted to the
accounting staff. The accounting software can then compare received amounts to
the purchase order (which is usually entered into the computer already). All that is
left for the accounting staff to do is to enter the purchase order number listed on the
supplier’s invoice into the computer to see what quantity has been received and
how much has not yet been paid. By taking this approach, the bulk of the accounts
payable matching process is eliminated.

Before implementing this best practice, there are a few issues to review. One is
that the receiving staff must be properly trained in how to enter receipts into the
computer. If they are not, receipts information will be inaccurate, probably
resulting in the accounts payable staff’s going back to manual matching, since
it is the only way to ensure that invoices are accurately paid. Another issue is


3-16 Request That Suppliers Enter Invoices through a Web Site 39

ensuring that the existing accounting software allows the receiving personnel to
enter receipts information. This is a standard feature on most accounting software
packages. However, some software packages do not use the information once it is
entered, so it is important to see if the software will match receipts to purchase
orders, showing any variances that may arise. If these issues can be overcome, then
it is reasonable for companies of any size or complexity to implement the direct
entry of receiving information into the computer at the receiving dock.

The typical vendor database includes listings for thousands of suppliers. Every time
an invoice arrives from a supplier, the accounts payable staff must scroll through the
list to determine the vendor code for each one. If there are similar names for different
suppliers, or multiple locations for the same one, it is quite likely that the resulting
check payments will go astray, leading to lots of extra time to sort through who
should have been paid. This basic problem can be partially resolved by having
suppliers include the supplier number, as created by the company’s accounting
system, on their invoices. The easiest way to do so is to mail out a change-of-address
form to all suppliers, listing the same company address, but also noting as part of the
address an “accounts payable code” that includes the supplier number. Suppliers will
gladly add this line to the mailing address to which they send their invoices, since
they think it is a routing code that will expedite payment to them (which, in a way, it
will). Some follow-up may be necessary to ensure that all suppliers adopt this extra
address line. Even if not all of the suppliers elect to make the change, there will still be
an increase in efficiency caused by those that have done so.

There are two problems with this approach. One is that the change-of-address
mailing cannot be a bulk mailing of the same letter, since each letter must include
the supplier code that is unique to each recipient. This will call for a mail merge
software application that can create a separate and unique letter for each recipient.
The other problem is that new suppliers (i.e., those arriving after the bulk mailing)
must be given a supplier code at the time they are first set up on the system. This
may require a special phone call to the supplier’s accounts payable department to
ensure that the code is added to their address file, or else a periodic mailing to all
new suppliers that specifies their supplier codes.

3-16 Request That Suppliers Enter Invoices through a Web Site

If the payables manager wants to reduce the amount of data-entry work in the
payables area, a possible option is to require suppliers to enter invoice data into a

web site that interfaces with the company’s accounts payable software. Not only
does this shift the data-entry burden to suppliers, but there is also a possibility that
the resulting invoices will be more accurate, since suppliers have a vested interest
in inputting highly accurate invoices.

The downside of this approach is the need to maintain an Internet site and an
interface to the accounts payable software. It may also be difficult to convince
suppliers to enter their invoices in this manner, especially if the invoices are for
small amounts of money. The approach will likely gain greater acceptance if the
company is large enough to demand the data entry, and if the amounts involved are
large enough to make it worthwhile for suppliers.

3-17 Audit Expense Reports

A labor-intensive task for the accounts payable employees involves carefully
reviewing every line item on employee expense reports, comparing everything to
the company policy for allowable travel or entertainment expenses, and then
contacting employees regarding inconsistencies prior to issuing a check. For a large
company with many traveling employees, this can be an extraordinarily labor-
intensive task. Furthermore, most employees create accurate expense reports, so the
labor expended by the accounts payable staff is rarely equal to the cost savings all
the review work generates. To make the situation more unbearable for employees,
the expense reviews take so long to complete that there can be a serious delay before
an employee receives payment for a check—especially if the expense report is
rejected due to reporting failures by the employee, resulting in the expense report
moving back and forth several times between the employee and the accounting
department before it is paid. When there is so much document travel time, it is also
common for the expense report to be “lost in the shuffle,” meaning that the employee
may have to create the expense report all over again and resubmit it. All of these
factors result in an inefficient process in the accounting department and lots of angry
employees who are waiting for reimbursement.

The solution to this problem is to replace a total review of all expense reports
with an occasional audit. This approach involves taking a sample of many employ-
ees’ expense reports every few months and comparing the reported amounts to the
company travel and entertainment policy to see if there are any exceptions. If the
exceptions are significant, it may be necessary to follow up with additional reviews of
the expense reports of the same employees to investigate possible abuse. The audit
usually results in a list of common expense reporting problems, as well as the names
of employees who are abusing the expense reporting system. There are several
solutions to ongoing expense reporting problems:

¢ Employee education. It may be necessary to periodically reissue the
company policy on travel and entertainment, with follow-up calls to specific


3-17 Audit Expense Reports 41

abusers to reinforce the policy. This advance work keeps problems from
showing up on expense reports.

¢ Flag employees for continual audits. If some employees simply cannot
create a correct expense report, they can be listed for ongoing audits to ensure
that every report they create is reviewed for accuracy.

¢ Flag employees for complete reviews by the accounts payable staff. Some
employees may be so inept at issuing proper expense reports that their reports
must be totally reviewed prior to reimbursement. These problem employees
can be flagged during the audits.

The audit work is usually carried out by the internal audit department, rather
than the accounts payable personnel, since the internal auditors are appropriately
experienced in this sort of review work.

The following bullet points include some in-depth audit techniques that the
internal auditors can use to ensure that all submitted claims on expense reports are
valid:

¢ See if a boarding pass is included as supporting detail for airfare. A receipt for
a flight is not sufficient, since the employee could have booked a flight and
then canceled it.

¢ See ifa final grade document or course certificate is included as supporting detail
for a training class. A receipt for a training class payment is not sufficient, since
the employee could have canceled the class and obtained a refund.

¢ If an employee submits a receipt for a group, such as for a block of hotel
rooms, multiple airfares, or a group dinner, then review the expense reports
submitted by the other employees in the group to see whether they have also
submitted expenses for the same things.

¢ Look for multiple receipts from the same store that have a date and time stamp
that are very close together. This could mean that an employee waits for other
customers to buy items from the store and then asks them for the receipt.

If any expenses look questionable, obtain the employee’s credit card state-
ments for the expense report period under review, as well as for the following
month, to see if charged receipts actually appear on the statements, and if any
refunds appear in the following month.

When using this best practice, there can be a concern that employee reporting
abuses will go unnoticed until an auditor finds a problem after the fact. This is a
legitimate concern. However, when the audit staff selects expense reports for review,
they should stratify the sample of reports so that there is a preponderance of very
expensive expense reports in the sample, which means that any potentially exorbitant
abuses will have a greater chance of being discovered. Though these discoveries will
be after the fact, when employees have already been paid, the company can still seek
reimbursement, especially if the employees are still on the payroll, so that


42 Accounts Payable Best Practices

adjustments can be taken from their paychecks. However, if employees have
already left the company, any overpayments probably cannot be reimbursed.

In short, replacing a total review of all expense reports with an occasional
audit can significantly reduce the workload of the accounts payable staff, though
there is some risk that employee reporting abuses will result in large overpayments
prior to discovery.

3-18 Automate Expense Reporting

One of the tasks of the accounts payable staff is to check carefully all of the
expenses reported in an employee’s expense report to ensure that all expenses are
valid and have the correct supporting documentation. This can be a major task if
there are many expense reports. This will be the case if a company is a large one or
has a large proportion of personnel who travel, which is common if a company is in
the consulting or sales field. Luckily, some companies have found a way to get
around all of this review work.

A best practice that nearly eliminates the expense report review work of the
accounts payable staff is to create a “smart” computer program that walks an
employee through the expense reporting process, flagging problem expenses as
soon as they are entered and requiring back-up receipts for only selected items. The
system is highly customized, since the review rules will vary by company. For
example, one company may have a policy of requiring backup for all meals,
whereas another company may automatically hand out a per diem meals payment
and will not care about meals receipts. Such variations in expense reporting
policies will inevitably result in an automated expense reporting system that is
closely tailored to each company’s needs; such a system should probably be
programmed in-house, which is a very expensive undertaking. Due to the high
level of expense, this best practice will pay for itself only if it offsets a great deal of
accounts payable work, so there should be a very large number of expense reports
being submitted before anyone tries to implement the concept.

The logical flow of automated expense reporting is noted in the following
process. The key issue here is that all employees must have direct access to the
program so it can respond to their expense entries as soon as they make them. This
requires online access by anyone who will use the program. The processing steps
are as follows:

1. The user accesses an online expense reporting form that is linked to the
central expense reporting software and database.

2. The user enters expenses by date and category.

3. The software reviews all expenses as entered and flags those that are not
allowable. It rejects these and notifies the user, along with an explanation.


3-18 Automate Expense Reporting 43

4. The software reviews all remaining expenses and decides which items
require a back-up receipt.

5. The user prints out a transmittal form detailing all required receipts and that
also contains a unique transmittal number that is linked to the expense report
that was just entered into the computer.

6. Upon completion by the user, the electronic expense report is routed by e-
mail to the user’s supervisor, who electronically approves or rejects the
report. If rejected, the supervisor can note the problem on the expense
report, which is then routed back to the user for resubmission.

7. The user attaches all receipts to the transmittal form and mails it to the
accounts payable department.

8. When the accounts payable department receives the transmittal form and
receipts, it verifies that all receipts are included and that the expense report
has been approved by the supervisor, and then approves the entire package.

9. Upon approval by the accounts payable staff, the expense report is
immediately paid by wire transfer to the bank account of the user.

10. The transmittal form and receipts are filed.

These detailed steps are shown in graphical form in Exhibit 3.3. Though there
appear to be more steps in the automated process than there are in a traditional
process, the extra steps are automatic or much simpler. The overall result is far less
processing time, as well as a significant reduction in the time needed before an
employee is paid.

The solution just noted is for an automated employee expense reporting
system that is entirely custom programmed. However, many organizations do
not process a sufficient number of employee expense reports to justify the cost
of all the programming time that is required to create the system. For these
organizations, a good alternative is to rent an online expense reporting software
package. These packages are entirely self-contained and do an effective job of
processing employee expense reports, but they do not provide direct linkages to
the rest of a company’s accounting system. For this, a custom-designed
interface module is still required. A Web-based expense reporting package
is especially useful, since employees in outlying locations or who are traveling
can use the system at any location where they can access the Internet. Also,
Web-based software can be updated easily, whereas client-server systems
require updates on individual user computers. Further, if someone steals an
employee’s computer, there is no time or expense information stored on it,
since this information is submitted directly through the Internet to a different
storage location.

3-19 Eliminate Cash Advances for Employee Travel

Many employees with few funds on hand will come to the accounts payable
department asking for cash advances so they can go on company-mandated trips.
By doing so, the department may be handing over more cash than the employee
really needs, which can make it difficult to collect any unspent cash. In addition,
employees who have already been paid for their expenditures have no incentive
to submit an expense report, especially when the report may reveal that they


3-20 Link Corporate Travel Policies 45

must pay some of the original advance back to the company. The usual result is a
prolonged process of asking employees for expense reports, while the amount of
the original advance remains, incorrectly, on the accounting books as a
prepaid expense.

This problem is eliminated by denying cash travel advances. However, this is
much easier said than done. In reality, many employees simply cannot afford to be
out-of-pocket on any company-related expenses. If so, the company can purchase
many of their expenses for them, such as airline tickets. Also, such an employee
can travel with another employee who has the financial wherewithal to absorb cash
expenditures for both employees. As a last resort, the company can also issue
company credit cards to employees, though this raises the risk of having the cards
used for noncompany purchases. Through some combination of these actions, a
company can reduce its reliance on cash advances to employees.

3-20 Link Corporate Travel Policies to an Automated Expense
Reporting System

The typical set of travel policies used by a company is quite detailed—thou shalt
not charge to the company the cost of movies, clothing, first-class upgrades, and so
on. However, the overburdened accounts payable staff has little time to review
expense reports for these items, much less to then create variance reports and send
them out to the violating employees and their supervisors. An additional problem is
that corporate travel policies change with some regularity, which makes it difficult
for the accounts payable staff to even know which policies are still valid. A further
problem arises when a company reimburses its employees based on the per diem
rates listed in the Federal Travel Regulation. This document is used by the federal
government to determine a reasonable cost of living at each of over 100 cities
throughout the country; given the frequency of change in these numbers (at least
quarterly), it becomes very labor intensive to determine which payments to make
to employees. However, these problems can be eliminated by converting the travel
policies into rules that can be used by a computer to automatically spot problems
with expense reports that have been submitted through an automated expense
reporting system.

For example, input from a corporate travel card into an automated expense
reporting system can tell if an airfare is for a first-class seat, which may be
prohibited by company travel policy. If the first-class purchase can be set up as a
flagged field, then the computer system can automatically spot this issue and either
note it on a report or (more proactively) send an e-mail to the appropriate person,
who makes note of the issue. Examples of other rule violations are to verify that the
correct airline was used (since there may be a bulk-purchase agreement in place)
and that restaurant bills were actually incurred during the period spanned by a


46 Accounts Payable Best Practices

business trip (rather than before or after, which would be suspicious). However,
this sort of early-warning system can be quite expensive to create, and so should
only be considered if there is a clear likelihood that there will be significant
resulting cost savings.

3-21 Match Travel Bookings to Expenses

A company can link its travel policies to an online expense reporting system, as
just described in the preceding best practice. However, this approach is after-the-
fact, in that expenses have already been incurred. The result is likely to be a tussle
between the company and employees who are annoyed that their expense
reimbursement claims were rejected.

An enhanced approach is to require all bookings to be run through a central
bookings department, and then match actual travel expenses to the original
amounts that were booked. Doing so can reveal a number of surprises, such as:

¢ Last-minute upgrades by employees once they are on-site.
¢ Rate changes by hotels.

¢ Rerouting fees caused by flight overbookings.

In some cases, the information revealed by this comparison will show that
employees are justified in their complaints that certain expenses should be
reimbursed. In other cases, the company may have reasonable grounds for
pursuing a hotel or airline for overcharging in comparison to the price at which
bookings were originally made. At a minimum, the comparison is useful for
analyzing travel patterns and negotiating discounts with travel suppliers. Also,
using a central booking system allows for the matching of corporate travel policies
to bookings before any funds are spent, so there should be fewer complaints later,
when employees submit their expense reports.

One likely outcome of this best practice is that in-house travel bookings are
more likely to fall under the area of responsibility of either the chief financial
officer (CFO) or the purchasing manager, since both are deeply interested in
expense control.

3-22 Centralize the Accounts Payable Function

A company with many subsidiaries or locations usually has a separate accounts
payable function located in each facility. This can be inefficient for several reasons.


3-22 Centralize the Accounts Payable Function 47

First, the accounting staff at each location requires a supervisor, so the sum total of
supervisors at all the locations can be substantial. Second, there can be problems with
suppliers sending invoices to the wrong locations. This is a particular problem when
the subsidiaries all have the same or similar names, since it is difficult for a supplier to
figure out which location is the correct one to which a bill should be sent. The
problem is exacerbated if a supplier ships to several company locations and then must
issue a separate invoice to each location, since it is confusing to issue billings when
not only the company names are identical, but also the goods shipped to all of them.
Third, the many accounts payable departments all require training and auditing to
ensure that they all process payments in the same manner. If a company does not do
this, it is likely that discounts will not be taken or that payments will be made without
proper authorization. Finally, there is a lack of control when the accounts payable
function is widely distributed. Local management can interfere with the payable
process to make payments to themselves or to entities they control, while still giving
the appearance of good local controls. All of these problems can be either eliminated
or mitigated by using a central accounts payable facility.

A centralized accounts payable facility does not have to be near any other
company locations. It pays all supplier invoices, using a single computer system
and a single accounting database, and operates under the control of a small, unified
group of managers. It has multiple advantages. First, there are far fewer managers,
since there is only one group of people to control. Second, there are no problems
with supplier invoices and related information disappearing, because all invoices
are sent to the one processing location. If a supplier incorrectly sends paperwork to
the wrong location, all facilities know where it must be forwarded, so the
documents always arrive at the correct point (though they may take a roundabout
route to get there). Third, all accounts payable activities can be easily monitored
and corrected, since the auditing personnel only have to review one facility.
Finally, there is better control over the process, since the accounts payable function
is divorced from local control; there is no way for a local manager to influence
payments. All of these advantages have a single result—lower cost, primarily
through an overall reduction in the number of personnel. It has been proven many
times that a single, centralized accounts payable function is considerably cheaper
than a dispersed function.

Despite all these advantages, some companies balk at centralizing because of
protests by local managers. They claim that some payments must be made locally,
because some payments are cash-on-delivery, in cash, or require such short
payment intervals that the central facility cannot respond in time. They are correct.
However, this is such a small proportion of the bills at most facilities that a local
plant can get by with a few checks per month, which are drawn on a separate bank
account in which the company keeps a very small cash reserve. By limiting the size
of local payments, a company can limit its exposure to any unwarranted local
payments. By meeting local management demands partway, a company can still
centralize the bulk of its payments while continuing to allow some local flexibility.
This is a very good best practice to implement if a company has multiple locations.

3-23 Store Late Fees in a Separate General Ledger Account

An inefficient accounts payable process, or one that loses track of supplier invoices,
will inevitably incur late fees charged by suppliers. When this happens, the fee is
generally recorded in the same expense account to which the rest of a supplier invoice
is charged. As a result, the inefficiency of the accounting department is passed
through to the department that originally ordered the goods or services from the
supplier, even though it is not the originating department’s fault.

A more responsible approach is to record late fees in a separate general ledger
account that is charged to the accounting department. By summarizing all late fees
in a single account, management can also see if late payments are a significant
expense for the company—information that would be impossible to locate under
the old system.

The prime difficulty with this best practice is that the accounting staff does not
like to document its own failures and so might “accidentally” charge late fees to
other accounts. Accordingly, have the internal audit department periodically test
the payables recording system to ensure that late fees are being stored in the correct
account.

3-24 Issue Standard Account Code List

Accounts payable can be a difficult area in which to replace employees while still
experiencing high levels of productivity. The problem is caused by the time it takes
anew person to learn the accounts to which invoices should be coded. Even when
experienced accounts payable clerks are hired, they still must memorize the
account codes, which will slow them down considerably. Even an experienced,
long-term employee may occasionally misdirect a supplier invoice to the wrong
account, so some solution is necessary to resolve the issue.

The easiest way to resolve the problem is to reduce the chart of accounts
(which can be a very lengthy document) down to a single page of key accounts to
which invoices are to be coded. Most invoices can be applied to a very small
number of accounts, so this is usually a very viable option. When the shortened list
is posted at each accounts payable clerk’s desk, it becomes a simple reference tool
for finding the correct account, which improves productivity while reducing the
error rate.

A more sophisticated way to resolve the problem is to encode the accounting
software with an account number for each supplier. Under this method, the clerk
does not have to worry about the account to which anything should be coded


3-25 Link Supplier Requests to the Accounts Payable Database 49

because the computer already contains the information. However, the account code
may change, depending on what the supplier is billing. Given the trend toward
supplier consolidation, it is increasingly likely that a company will go to one
supplier for a wide range of products and services so that several account codes
may apply to a single supplier.

A simple list of approved account codes is an easy way to improve the
productivity and reduce the error rate of the accounts payable staff, especially that
of new employees.

Cost: SF Installation time:

3-25 Link Supplier Requests to the Accounts Payable Database

A significant task for an accounts payable person, especially one working for a
company that pays its bills late, is to answer payment queries from suppliers. They
want to know when their invoices were paid, the amount of the payments, and the
check numbers that were issued. For a company that is seriously delinquent in its
payments, this can be a full-time job for the accounting staff, which is also a clear
loss of productive time.

A recent innovation that largely eliminates verbal responses to suppliers is to
have suppliers call a phone number that links them to a keypad-activated inquiry
system that will answer their most common questions. For example, they can enter
the company’s purchase order number, their invoice number, or the supplier’s
name; the system will then respond with the specific payments made, the date on
which the check was cut, and the check number. The system can even be extended
to list the date on which payments are scheduled to be made.

However, there are some issues to consider before installing an automated
supplier response system. One issue is that suppliers want to talk to a person and
will deluge the company’s operator to voice this opinion. To quell this type of
response, the system should include an option to exit the automated system and
contact a person. This allows the more technologically versed suppliers to use the
automated system, while other users can still talk to an employee. This option is
also necessary for those cases where there are unusual circumstances. For example,
a company may not be paying due to a lack of receiving documentation, or because
the quantity billed was incorrect. It is better to discuss these problems with a person
instead of a computer, since special actions may need to be taken to resolve the
situation. The other problem is the cost of the installation. It requires an interface
computer that links to the main accounting computer system, as well as Internet
access and software, to translate supplier requests into inquiries that the accounting
database can answer. These costs can be considerable, especially when there are
expected to be many callers and many requests for information. The price range
typically starts at $20,000 for the smallest installations and can be many times
higher for large systems. Nonetheless, this is a good approach for companies that


50 Accounts Payable Best Practices

feel they can bring about a major efficiency improvement by routing suppliers
straight to the accounts payable database for information.

An alternative to having suppliers access accounts payable information
through a phone connection is to do so through an Internet site. This approach
is somewhat more flexible than a voice-activated system that is generally limited to
a few simple status messages. Instead, a Web page can itemize the exact status of
each payable item, assign a code to it that explains the reasons for any delays, and
note the name of the contact person in the accounts payable department who is
responsible for processing the supplier invoice. It can also list any missing
information that is delaying payment, such as a purchase order number or
bank account number for the supplier, which can be entered by the supplier
directly into the web site, and which will be automatically loaded into the
accounting database to assist in the completion of processing. The Web page
may even list the name of the person who is responsible for approving the invoice,
as well as this person’s contact information. A company may not want to add this
last piece of information, since it can greatly increase the volume of phone calls to
these people, who will in turn bother the accounts payable staff about payment—
something that it is trying to avoid through the use of this web site.

3-26 Shrink the Supplier Base

Part of the job of the accounts payable staff is to maintain a complete and accurate
database of suppliers, which typically includes address and payment information.
If data are entered incorrectly, the accounting staff is usually notified by a supplier
that has not received a payment (because it was sent to the wrong address), has
been paid the wrong amount (because of an incorrect early payment discount rate),
or has been paid at the wrong time (because of an incorrect due date). This type of
problem is inevitable in even the best-run company and will require some time to
research and fix. However, the problem is greatly exacerbated in a company that
has many suppliers, because there are so many chances for the supplier information
to be incorrect. Another problem with having many suppliers is that there is
typically little control over adding new suppliers (after all, that is how there came to
be so many suppliers in the first place!). The accounting staff must deal constantly
with adding new data to the supplier database, consolidating supplier records that
have been entered multiple times, and (especially) making a multitude of small
payments to a plethora of suppliers. Wouldn’t it be much easier if there were just
fewer suppliers?

This is a best practice—reducing the number of suppliers. It is much easier to
maintain accurate data in a relatively small number of supplier records, while there
are few new suppliers to add to the database. In addition, the volume of purchases
from the smaller number of suppliers tends to be larger, so there are typically


3-27 Withhold First Payment until W-9 Form Is Received 51

fewer, larger invoices that can be keypunched more easily into the accounting
database and paid with fewer, larger checks. Essentially, shrinking the supplier
database reduces a variety of data-entry tasks.

Unfortunately, shrinking the number of suppliers is not easy. The first
problem is that the accounting staff must convince the purchasing staff to adopt a
supplier reduction strategy, which the purchasing staff may not be so eager to
pursue, especially if they prefer the strategy of sourcing parts from multiple
suppliers. In addition, company employees may be in the habit of buying from
any supplier they want, which can require a considerable amount of retraining
before they are willing to buy from a much shorter list of approved suppliers.
The effort required to reduce the number of suppliers is frequently far in excess
of the productivity gains realized by the accounts payable staff, so most
controllers do not pursue this best practice unless there is already either an
active supplier reduction campaign in place, or else the head of the purchasing
department appears to be amenable to the idea. Even then, a supplier reduction
strategy does not take place overnight. On the contrary, it can take years to effect
a massive cutback in the supplier base. Accordingly, this strategy should only be
adopted when there is multidepartmental support for the idea as well as a long
implementation timeline.

3-27 Withhold First Payment until W-9 Form Is Received

Within one month after the calendar year is complete, the accounts payable
department must issue completed 1099 forms to a variety of business entities,
detailing how much money the company paid them during the year. The IRS uses its
copy of this information to ensure that the revenue reported by the recipients is
correct. The trouble for the issuing company is that many potential recipients do not
want to report income to the government, and so will refuse to fill out a W-9 form or to
supply a taxpayer identification number to the company. Thus, completing 1099
forms by the IRS-mandated due date can be a substantial problem.

A simple way to avoid this issue is to withhold payment of a company’s first
payment to a supplier until it completes and submits a W-9 form to the company. By
doing so, the accounts payable staff avoids the year-end hassle of determining who
receives a 1099 form. This step does add work to the check-processing function but
eliminates so much more work when the 1099 forms are issued that the extra labor is
worth it. This best practice can put the accounts payable staff under some pressure
from the materials management department if that group is trying to obtain rapid
delivery of crucial parts from a new supplier who wants payment in advance. In most
other instances, there will be little in-house opposition to this system.

52 Accounts Payable Best Practices

3-28 Automate Payments for Repetitive Invoicing

The typical company has a small proportion of invoices that arrive at regular
intervals and are for the same amount, month after month. Examples of such
payments are rent invoices or lease payments. These payments usually go through
the typical accounts payable matching process, including searches for approval
documents, before they are paid. However, it is possible to utilize their repetitive
nature to create a more efficient subprocess within the accounts payable area.

The simple best practice that streamlines repetitive supplier invoices is to
create a payment schedule to bypass the approval process and automatically issue a
check in a prespecified amount and on a prespecified date. This can be done by
creating a table of repetitive payments in the accounting computer system; but
there is no reason that the programming expense cannot be avoided by just listing
the payments on a piece of paper and posting it in the accounts payable area. In
either case, there is no need to look for approvals, so there is less labor required of
the accounts payable staff. However, there are two problems. First, the repetitive
payment schedule must note the termination date of each payment, so that checks
are not inadvertently issued after the final payment date. These payments can be
time consuming when the supplier returns them, if the company even notices the
overpayment at all. Second, the repetitive payments may change from time to time,
so the schedule must note both the dates when payment amounts change and the
amounts of the changes. For example, rental payments frequently contain preset
escalation clauses, which must be recognized by the repetitive payment schedule.

An especially fine use for repetitive invoicing is the remittance of garnish-
ments to various courts on behalf of employees. In the case of child support
payments, these garnishments may go on for years, and usually in the same amount
through the entire period (unless the court orders that a different amount be
withheld from time to time). Repetitive invoicing is quite useful here, because a
company is liable to the court to make these payments, and can be subject to
onerous penalties if it does not do so. By shifting the burden of making this
payment to the computer system, there is less risk of not making the payment.

Automating repetitive payments that occur in the same amounts and on the
same dates is a good way to remove the approval step from the accounts payable
process, although this improvement typically only covers a small percentage of the
total workload of the accounts payable staff.

3-29 Install a Payment Factory

In a typical accounts payable environment, a company allows its subsidiaries to
manage their own payables processes, payments, and banking relationships. The
result is higher transaction costs and banking fees, since each location uses its own


3-30 Eliminate Manual Checks 53

staff and has little transaction volume with which to negotiate reduced banking
fees.

An improvement on this situation is the payment factory, which is a central-
ized payables and payment processing center. It is essentially a subset of an ERP
system, specifically targeted at payables. It features complex software with many
interfaces, since it must handle incoming payment information in many data
formats, work-flow management of payment approvals, a rules engine to deter-
mine the lowest-cost method of payment, and links to multiple banking systems.

Key payment factory benefits include a stronger negotiating position with the
company’s fewer remaining banks, better visibility into funding needs and
liquidity management, and improved control over payment timing.

The payment factory is especially effective when the payables systems of
multinational subsidiaries are centralized, since cross-border banking fees can be
significantly reduced. For example, it can automatically offset payments due
between company subsidiaries, resulting in smaller cash transfers and similarly
reduced foreign exchange charges, wiring costs, and lifting fees (a fee charged by
the bank receiving a payment), while also routing payments through in-country
accounts to avoid these international fees.

There are several problems with payment factories—the seven-figure cost of the
software, gaining the cooperation of the various subsidiaries who will no longer have
direct control over their payment systems, and different banking relationships.

How can you adapt the payment factory to a low-budget situation? First,
centralize your accounts payable operations. Second, minimize the number of
banking relationships. Third, try outsourcing the foreign exchange operations with
one of your remaining banks.

3-30 Eliminate Manual Checks

The accounts payable process can be streamlined through the use of many best
practices that are listed in this chapter; however, a common recurring problem is
those payments that go around the entire preplanned payable process. These are the
inevitable payments that are sudden and unplanned and that must be handled
immediately. Examples are payments for pizza deliveries, flowers for bereaved
employees, or cash-on-delivery payments. In all of these cases, the accounting staff
must drop what it is doing, create a manual check, get it signed, and enter the
information on the check into the computer system. To make matters worse, due to
the rush basis of the payment, it is common for the accounting person to forget to
make the entry into the computer system, which throws off the bank reconciliation
work at the end of the month, which creates still more work to track down and fix
the problem. In short, issuing manual checks significantly worsens the efficiency of
the accounts payable staff.


54 Accounts Payable Best Practices

You can use three methods to reduce the number of manual checks. The first
method is to cut off the inflow of check requests, while the second is (paradoxically) to
automate the cutting of manual checks. The first approach is a hard one, since it
requires tallying the manual checks that were cut each month and following up with
the check requesters to see if there might be a more orderly manner of making requests
in the future, thereby allowing more checks to be issued through the normal accounts
payable process. Unfortunately, this practice requires so much time communicating
with the check requesters that the lost time will overtake the resulting time savings by
the accounting staff from writing fewer manual checks. The second, and better,
approach, is to preset a printer with check stock so that anyone can request a check at
any time, and an accounting person can immediately sit down at a computer terminal,
enter the check information, and have it print out at once. This approach has the unique
benefit of avoiding any trouble with not reentering information into the computer
system, since it is being entered there in the first place (which avoids any future
problems with the bank reconciliation). It tends to take slightly longer to create a check
in this manner, but the overall time savings are greater.

A third alternative is to make the process of creating a manual check so
difficult that requesters will avoid this approach. For example, the request may
require the signature of a senior manager or multiple approving signatures. In
addition, the accounting department could charge an exorbitant amount for this
service to the requesting department on the corporate financial statements. Further,
a report itemizing all manual check requests can be sent to senior management each
month, highlighting who is bothering the accounting staff with these items. Any
combination of these actions should reduce the use of manual checks.

3-31 Eliminate Wire Transfers

There will be times when a supplier must be paid on extremely short notice—
perhaps within a few hours. If so, the accounting staff must spend time setting up a
wire transfer, obtaining approval from an authorized manager, and paying a hefty
wire transfer fee that is likely to be 20 times higher than the cost of a check or
Automated Clearing House (ACH) payment. In addition, the receiving bank will
probably charge a similar fee to the recipient, which is called a lifting fee. In short,
wire transfers are both labor intensive and also very expensive.

The lowest-cost and quickest alternative to a wire transfer is an ACH payment.
An ACH can be easily initiated through an on-line connection with a company’s
bank, and the funds can be in the recipient’s bank account in as little as two
business days. While the solution is obvious, obtaining sufficient notice to use
ACH can require the imposition of additional systems. In particular, the controller
should investigate the reason every wire transfer was initiated and create a system
for avoiding the last-minute payment requirement in the future. This may require


3-33 Settle Foreign Intercompany Payables 55

dozens of investigations. For example, a supplier payment may have been delayed
due to a missing manager approval, or an advance payment is required by a
supplier to begin work on a new machine, or a payment is required to begin leasing
new office space. In all cases, the controller needs to educate people about the
expense of a wire transfer, and how a brief payment delay can yield a much more
cost-effective solution.

3-32 Increase the Frequency of Check Runs

The issuance of a manual check involves a great deal of extra work for the accounts
payable staff, because they must perform a number of tasks that are normally spread
over a much larger number of checks in the typical check run, plus handle the manual
logging of the check into the computer system. If they forget to enter the manual
check, then even more time is lost during the bank reconciliation process, when the
check will appear as an exception, and must be investigated and reconciled.

One way to reduce the number of manual checks is to investigate how many of
the checks could have been included in the normal check run if there had been
more frequently scheduled check runs. For example, if check runs are performed
only on Fridays and a check request appears on Monday, could the person
demanding the check wait a few days until a midweek check run, or would he
still require an immediate payment? In many cases, adding one or two check runs
per week will be more cost effective than issuing a large quantity of manual checks.
The correct solution will vary by company, depending on the volume and nature of
each manual check request.

An alternative approach is to shift the date on which check runs are completed,
rather than increase their frequency. For example, what if most manual checks are
demanded by the sales staff, who return from out-of-state sales trips on Fridays and want
to be paid the following Monday? The solution may be shifting the standard check run to
the end of the day on Monday, in order to eliminate these manual payments.

Yet another alternative is to offer electronic (ACH) payments if those
requiring payments can wait until the standard pay date. Since an electronic
payment clears the bank much faster than a check, this can be an inducement for
those requesting checks to wait until the normally scheduled pay date.

3-33 Settle Foreign Intercompany Payables

In a multinational organization, there are likely to be a number of subsidiaries, each
of which may owe accounts payable to the other subsidiaries or the corporate parent.


56 Accounts Payable Best Practices

Since these payables are considered “in the family,” there may be a tendency to not
pay them, and instead let the intercompany accounts build up over a long period of
time. However, the Internal Revenue Service may impute interest income to the
creditor entity in these situations, on which income taxes must be paid.

The obvious solution is to settle all accounts payable on a regular basis.
However, doing so may require the use of foreign exchange transactions, which
will require currency conversion fees by the banks handling these transactions. The
fees can be avoided if a company maintains local currency reserves. Another
option is to net all payables and receivables within the entire company on a regular
basis and then only transfer the net payables amount, which may drastically lower
the amount of foreign exchange payments. An alternative is to go along with the
imputed interest income concept by charging interest at the market rate as a normal
company procedure on all intercompany payables that are not likely to be settled
within their normal payment terms.

3-34 Have Regularly Scheduled Check-Signing Meetings

If company management insists on signing all checks, as opposed to the use of
signature stamps, then the accounts payable staff must either track down these
people and loom threateningly over them while they sign the checks, or else
meekly leave piles of checks on their desks and hope to receive the completed
checks back within not too many weeks. Either approach is unacceptable, since the
first puts the accounting staff in the uncomfortable position of forcing managers to
interrupt their workdays in order to sign checks, while the latter approach interferes
with the timely distribution of checks to suppliers and employees.

A good way to resolve this difficulty is to arrange for regularly scheduled
check-signing meetings, preferably immediately after scheduled check runs. By
doing so, managers will have already blocked out time for this work and will feel
less compelled to drop other work to complete their signing duties. Also, it means
that the accountant delivering the checks can sit and amicably discuss issues with
the check signer, such as queries about the reason for some payments, while also
presenting issues on behalf of the accounting department. Because of the increased
level of communication available under this approach, it is not unusual for an
assistant controller to deliver the checks, rather than an accounting clerk.

3-35 Implement Positive Pay

Depending on the types of antifraud features used on a company’s check stock, it
may not be that difficult to alter the payable amount of a check. Consider using


3-36 Incorporate Copy Protection Features into Checks 57

positive pay to prevent such altered checks from being cashed. Under this
approach, the issuing company creates a file containing the check number,
date, and amount of all checks it issues each day and forwards the file to its
bank. The bank then compares the check information in this file to checks being
presented for payment and refuses to accept any checks containing different
information. This approach is considered the most effective way to keep fraudu-
lently altered checks from being cashed. Some banks offer a more advanced
positive pay system, where a company can review the digital images of exception
items online and enter a pay or return decision on the spot.

An improvement on the basic positive pay concept is for banks to also offer
positive pay that includes the name of the payee, which keeps anyone from cashing
a company check on which the payee name has been altered.

For those companies that do not want to spend time issuing a check file to the
bank whenever they issue checks, reverse positive pay is the solution. Under this
approach, the bank creates a file containing information about all checks presented
during the day, and sends it to the issuing company. Ideally, the company reviews
the file and approves only those checks for which it has matching information. In
reality, the bank can wait only a short time for the company to review the file, and
then accepts all checks if it is not otherwise notified by the company—which
makes this a weaker control than positive pay.

There are a few problems with positive pay:

¢ Ifthe payables clerk forgets to send the file of new checks to the bank after
each check run, then every check in that run will be refused by the bank.

¢ If the payables clerk forgets to include stop payments, voided checks, and
manual checks in the file, checks may be cleared that the company did not
intend to have clear, and vice versa.

¢ Ifthe bank updates its files with new incoming positive pay information only
during an overnight batch process, then anyone taking a check directly from
the company to the bank to be deposited at once may find that the check will be
rejected.

Despite these problems, positive pay is a useful fraud deterrent for many
companies.

3-36 Incorporate Copy Protection Features into Checks

Though rare, check counterfeiters occasionally either modify a check created by a
company or create an entirely new one, resulting in significant losses to the
company. There are a number of check protection features available that one can
incorporate into the company check stock in order to thwart the efforts of


58 Accounts Payable Best Practices

counterfeiters. As a general rule, always add more security features to a check,
because they compound the difficulty of replicating or altering the check. Here are
some of the features that can be ordered from the check printer:

¢ “Void” image. When a check is copied, the word void appears multiple times
on the copied version of the check. This makes it impossible for a counterfeiter
to create clean color copies of a check.

¢ Microprinting border. Text can be added along the edges of a check using
very small fonts, so they are only visible as text when magnified. When
copied, they appear as a line, with no discernible wording visible. This is a
less obvious way to deter the efforts of someone attempting to color-copy a
check.

¢ Modified background in dollar space. A set of wavy lines can be designed
into the check, in the area where the dollar amount is printed on the check. By
doing so, counterfeiters will have a very difficult time erasing existing dollar
amounts without visibly damaging the background.

¢ Watermark. A watermark can be added to a check that is only visible when
seen from an angle and that is impossible to duplicate when a check is run
through a copier. This technique is most effective when the check contains a
warning not to accept the check unless the watermark can be seen.

¢ Chemical sensitivity. The check stock is sensitive to a wide array of
chemicals, which will discolor the check when it is subjected to a chemical
wash.

¢ Copy void endorsement. If anyone attempts to photocopy the endorsement
on the back of a check, the word void will also appear in the photocopy.

¢ Endorsement warning. The endorsement box on the back of the check
contains a message stating that the check contains an authentication feature
and how to view it.

¢ Fluorescent ink. When exposed to ultraviolet light, wording appears that
authenticates the validity of the check. This feature can be enhanced with the
use of fluorescent fibers that are integrated into the check stock and also appear
under fluorescent light.

¢ Integrated Fourdrinier watermark. This is a watermark that is pressed into
the check stock at the paper mill and is visible from either side of the check.

¢ Laid lines. Lines of varying widths and spacing are printed on the back of the
check, which makes it difficult to make alterations to the check by cutting and
pasting.

¢ Prismatic printing. The background of the check includes subtle gradations
of color that are difficult to reproduce on a color copier.

¢ Thermochromatic ink. This is a heat-sensitive type of ink that is used within
an authentication seal on the back of a check. When rubbed, it reveals the seal.

3-37 Avoid Acronym Payees on Checks

When a company enters an acronym for a payee name on a check, there is a
heightened risk that someone could fraudulently alter the acronym, so that the
check can be paid to a different entity. For example, someone could easily add a
single letter to the acronym on a check made payable to the NAC (National Arts
Center), changing it to NACM (National Association for Credit Managers).

To avoid this type of fraud, always fully spell out the name of the payee on a
check. Since a computerized accounting system draws the payee name from the
vendor master file, this may require a review of that file to ascertain if any
acronyms are currently being used.

Cost: SF Installation time:

3-38 Revise Payment Terms for Electronic Payments

When a company pays with checks, it cuts a check on the negotiated due date,
which reaches the customer after a few days of mail float; the customer cashes it
and another two or three days pass before the check clears. This results in an
average total float of perhaps five days.

If the company switches to electronic payments, then the entire float vanishes,
so the cost to the issuing company has increased by the five days of interest income
that the company did not earn on the funds during the float period. In addition, the
company must pay a fee to process the electronic transaction. Offsetting this lost
income and processing fee is the cost savings from not having to process paper
checks, which includes the cost of the checks and the bank’s check processing fee.
Be sure to include in these costs only the incremental savings from not creating a
check (e.g., if the check signer no longer has to sign checks, is the company
actually saving money by then terminating the check signer (!), or does this person
merely work on other tasks?). Thus, it is probable that the company’s actual
incremental cost reduction is the cost of the check and the bank’s check processing
fee, and nothing else.

After netting the lost interest income, electronic payment fee, and reduced
processing cost, the company may still be losing money through the issuance of
electronic payments. If so, consider negotiating slightly longer payment terms with
suppliers to offset the increased cost. Of course, if the accounting department’s


60 Accounts Payable Best Practices

long-term strategy is to convert entirely to electronic payments, irrespective of
cost, then it may not be useful to attempt a payment term renegotiation, since some
suppliers may opt to still receive check payments.

3-39 Install Advanced ACH Debit Blocking

Banks have offered debit blocking for many years; this keeps unauthorized parties
from extracting funds from a company’s bank account with an ACH debit
transaction. Unfortunately, some ACH debits are legitimate, and are also rejected
by the debit block.

More advanced debit blocking options are available that allow for fine-tuning
of the use of debit blocking. They are as follows:

1. Block all debit transactions.
2. Enter broad screening criteria.
3. Enter specific instructions to accept only the following items:
© Accept onetime debits.
o Limit the number of times a recurring debit can post.
o Limit the time period over which an authorization is accepted.
© Specify a fixed, variable, or maximum debit dollar limit.

Also, if debits do not match the screening criteria, they can be sent to the
company in an unauthorized transaction report. An authorized person can then
review this report and contact the bank to authorize the acceptance or rejection of
specific debits.

Banks offer many variations on these advanced debit-blocking features, so
contact your bank to determine what is available.

3-40 Use a Signature Stamp

One of the most common delay points in the accounts payable process is when an
accounting clerk must go in search of someone to sign checks. If there is only one
person who is so authorized, and who is not always available, it can keep any
checks from being issued at all. The situation grows worse when multiple
signatures are required for larger checks. On top of these delays, it is also common
for the check signers to require back-up documents for each check being signed,


3-41 Notify Purchasing of Lower Invoiced Prices or Terms 61

which requires a considerable extra effort by the accounting staff, not only to clip
the correct documents to each check but also to unclip the documents after the
checks are signed and file them away in the appropriate files (which also increases
the risk that the documents will be filed in the wrong place). This is an exceptional
waste of time, since it does not add a whit of value to the process.

The solution to the multitude of inefficiencies related to check signing is to get
rid of the check signers completely. Instead of assuming that there must be a
complete review of all checks prior to signing, one must get management used to
the idea of installing approvals earlier in the process, thus eliminating approval at
the point of signing. Once management is comfortable with this idea, it is a simple
matter of complying with bank regulations, which require a signature on each
“check”—this is now a matter of finding the easiest way to place a signature on
checks, rather than an approval process. Check stamping can be accomplished
most simply by creating a signature stamp from the signature of an authorized
check signer, which requires that someone stamp all checks by hand. A more
efficient approach is to digitize an authorized signature and incorporate it into the
check-printing program, so that the signature is automatically affixed to each check
with no manual intervention. Under this latter approach, removable memory cards
contain the fonts, company logos, and signatures used for check printing, and are
inserted into a special check printer for the duration of each check run.

The only problem with a signature stamp is that it can be misused to sign
unauthorized checks or legal documents. This problem can be avoided by locking
it up in the company safe and severely limiting access to the safe. Removable
memory cards are more secure, but must still be locked when not in use. It may also
be necessary to lock up check stock, thereby making it doubly difficult for anyone
to issue an unauthorized signed check.

By using a signature stamp, you can eliminate the time wasted to find a check
signer, while also avoiding the work required to attach back-up documents to
checks and then file these documents subsequent to review.

3-41 Notify Purchasing of Lower Invoiced Prices or Terms

The payables staff is supposed to compare the prices on a supplier’s invoice to the
authorized prices on the originating purchase order to ensure that the price on
the supplier’s invoice is no higher than the authorized price. However, what should
the payables staff do in the rare cases when the invoiced price is Jower than the
purchase order price?

The payables staff should post the lower of the two figures into the payables
system as the one to be paid. In addition, they should notify the purchasing staff
when these lower prices are charged, so their next purchase orders will incorporate
the lower price. In addition, if other invoice terms, such as the early-payment

discount or payment duration, change in the company’s favor, then the payables
staff should also forward this information to the purchasing department.

Cost: SF Installation time: €3

3-42 Create Direct Purchase Interfaces to Suppliers

A common practice when purchasing is to issue a separate purchase order to a
supplier whenever a company wants to buy additional items. One solution to this
problem is to consolidate all the purchase orders into a single large one that covers
a long time period, which is called a blanket purchase order. This best practice is
described later in this chapter in best practice 3-44, “Use Blanket Purchase
Orders.” Though an excellent approach, it is sometimes possible to eliminate
the purchase order entirely by using a direct purchase interface to a supplier.

This best practice involves creating a computer or fax linkage to a supplier, so
that employees can order supplies directly from the supplier. By doing so, the
purchasing staff does not have to become involved in any purchases and the
accounts payable staff does not have to match any purchase orders to supplier
invoices, thereby saving time in two departments. Though a clear efficiency
improvement, this approach must be used with care because it eliminates some
control over purchases. Accordingly, it is usually only used for the purchase of
small-dollar items that are bought on a repetitive basis. Good examples of suppliers
that might be used for this approach are office or maintenance supply vendors. In
these cases, a company can create a standard form that only includes certain
products. Employees are allowed to fill out the form with any quantity they want
(within reason) and fax or mail it to the supplier, which uses it as authorization to
send goods to the company. A more advanced version of this format is to set up the
form on e-mail or on an electronic form directly linked to a supplier’s customer
orders database, for instant electronic transmission to the supplier. This latter
approach is faster and may allow a supplier to directly input an order into its
computer system, eliminating keypunching errors. By using a preset form for
ordering, a company can effectively curtail purchases to a few preselected items
that do not require further control.

The accounting staff will know in advance that any billings from the suppliers
to which employees send orders directly do not require purchase order matching,
and so they will expend less effort on paperwork prior to releasing a payment—just
match the supplier’s invoice to receiving documents to prove that the billed items
were really received. Though this is not an approach that can be applied to all
purchases, given the inherent lack of control, it can be used in a few cases, resulting
in increased accounts payable processing efficiency.

3-43 Install a Low-Cost Spend Management System 63

3-43 Install a Low-Cost Spend Management System

Spend management systems look like a great way to save money. Using these
systems, companies can analyze their expenditures in a number of ways—by
commodity, supplier, business unit, and so on. They then summarize this
information for centralized procurement negotiations with suppliers, thereby
reducing costs. Spend management suppliers add contract management capabili-
ties and even set up electronic supplier catalogs so that users can conduct online
ordering with a predefined set of suppliers. They also impose better controls over
spending, since their systems require access passwords, approval cycles, contract
compliance alerts, and supplier performance measurements.

The problem is that these systems are extremely expensive to install and
maintain—costs start at $1 million and rapidly head north from there. So, what can
a smaller business do to emulate a spend management system? Here are some
suggestions:

¢ Identify unauthorized purchases with exception reports. The reason for
centralizing procurement contracts is to negotiate lower prices in exchange for
higher purchasing volumes, so anyone purchasing from an unauthorized
supplier is reducing a company’s ability to reduce its costs. To identify these
people, create a table of approved suppliers and match it against the vendor
ledger for each period, yielding a report that lists how much was spent with
various unauthorized suppliers. It is also useful to record in an empty
purchasing or payables field the name of the requisitioning person, who
can then be tracked down and admonished for incorrect purchasing practices.

¢ Impose a penalty system. People resist centralization, especially when it
involves eliminating their favorite suppliers. Though penalties may be
considered a coercive approach to solving the problem, the imposition of a
graduated penalty scale will rapidly eliminate unauthorized spending. For
example, a department may incur a $100 penalty for one unauthorized
expenditure, $1,000 for the next, and $10,000 for the next.

¢ Restrict procurement cards to specific suppliers. If there is a procurement
card system in place, it may be possible to restrict purchases to specific
suppliers, thereby achieving centralized purchasing without any central over-
sight of the process. If there is no procurement card system, then consider
obtaining a credit card from each designated supplier, and restrict purchases to
those cards.

¢ Require officer-level approval of all contracts. Department and division
managers love to retain control over supplier relationships by negotiating their
own deals with local suppliers. By enforcing a corporatewide policy that all
purchasing contracts be countersigned by a corporate officer, contract copies
can be collected in one place for easier examination by a central purchasing
staff.


64 Accounts Payable Best Practices

¢ Add granularity to the chart of accounts. To gain a better knowledge of
costs, consider altering the chart of accounts to subdivide expenses by
individual department, and then go a step further by adding subcodes that
track costs at an additional level of detail. For example, if the existing account
code is 5020 for the travel expense account, and the revised code is 5020-01 to
track travel costs for just the engineering department, then consider adding a
set of subcodes, such as 5020-01—XX, to track more detailed expenditures
within the travel category, such as airfare (code 5020-01-01), hotels (code
5020-01-02), and rental cars (code 5020-01-03). This approach requires
careful definition of spending categories and can result in data-entry errors if
there are too many subcategories of expenses. Also, it will not be of much use
if reports cannot be created to properly interpret and present this extra level of
expense information.

These suggestions will not result in a seamless in-house spend management
system. However, they will yield somewhat greater control over expenses and
more visibility into the nature of a company’s expenditures.

3-44 Use Blanket Purchase Orders

One of the most time-consuming parts of the accounts payable process is matching
supplier invoices to purchase orders to ensure that all payments have been
authorized. This task is a difficult one if there are a multitude of supplier purchase
orders. In the typical company, there are hundreds if not thousands of open
purchase orders at any time; it is standard practice to issue a separate purchase
order every time an item is purchased. However, by shrinking the number of
purchase orders to be matched, you can reduce the workload of the accounts
payable staff.

A best practice that vastly reduces the number of purchase orders is blanket
purchase orders. These are long-term purchase orders, typically extending for a
one-year time period, which cover all of the expected purchases from a supplier for
that entire time period. By using blanket purchase orders, the accounts payable
staff can continually match to the same purchase orders for the entire year,
reducing the number of purchase orders that must be kept on hand.

This best practice is a simple one to implement from the accounting
perspective. There is no change in the way the accounting staff stores or matches
blanket purchase orders. They will continue to staple the purchase order to the
invoice and move it on for further processing. The only difference is that because
the amounts on the blanket purchase orders are so large, they will hardly ever be
equaled by a single supplier delivery. The accounting clerk must instead make a
facsimile of each purchase order and staple the copy to the supplier invoice. This is


3-45 Issue a Welcome Packet to New Suppliers 65

a minor change and will be easily accepted by the accounting staff when they see
that, in exchange, the volume of purchase orders has dropped significantly.

Though this seems like a best practice that should be implemented at once due
to the obvious benefits, consider the problem of working with an extra department
to ensure that the new system works. The problem with a blanket purchase order is
that it cannot be implemented without the cooperation of the purchasing staff and
the suppliers. To ensure that blanket purchase orders are used, one must discuss the
benefits of the system with the purchasing manager (who will see a significant
decline in paperwork as a result of using blanket purchase orders). The purchasing
manager must buy into the concept because this is the person who must in turn sell
the concept to suppliers. Another problem is that a typical company has so many
suppliers that it takes a substantial amount of time to implement blanket purchase
order agreements with all of them. Instead, it is frequently easier to either pare
down the number of suppliers or just implement blanket purchase orders with the
20 percent of suppliers with which a company typically does 80 percent of its
business. Either approach will allow a company to enter into blanket purchase
orders with suppliers that will substantially reduce the total number of blanket
purchase orders.

3-45 Issue a Welcome Packet to New Suppliers

When a company gains a new supplier, it rarely bothers to inform the supplier
about its payables processing rules. As a result, the supplier uses its standard billing
procedures by default, and is rightfully surprised if those procedures do not mesh
with the company’s payables system, resulting in delayed payments.

The solution is to create a welcome packet for new suppliers. At a minimum,
this should contain a W-9 form and a note that no payments will be made to the
supplier until the form is properly completed and returned to the company.
However, the welcome packet can contain a great deal more information that
will assist in the development of smoothly interlocked billing and payable systems
between the supplier and the company. For example, the welcome packet can
include the following additional information:

¢ Mailing address. The welcome packet should clearly state where all supplier
invoices are to be mailed. This is especially important if the company digitizes
all incoming invoices, because these invoices must first be routed through a
high-volume scanning operation that is usually fed from a single mailing
address.

¢ Purchasing reference. Most companies want to see an authorizing purchase
order number posted prominently on an invoice, so they can easily research


66 Accounts Payable Best Practices

the payment authorization. If invoices are not supported by a purchase order,
then specify in the welcome packet the procedure suppliers are to follow in
regard to the identification of the authorizing party on the invoice.

¢ Payment frequency. If the company processes check payments only once a
week, then say so—suppliers need to know which day of the week payments
are made, which will prevent them from calling the payables staff to ask when
their checks will be cut.

¢ Access codes. If the company has an online payables query system, make sure
that suppliers are fully informed about how to use it, and give them user
identification and passwords as part of the welcome packet so they are fully
outfitted to use the system.

¢ Evaluated receipts instructions. If the company has an evaluated receipts
system, (e.g., it pays suppliers based on quantities received rather than on
invoices received), the welcome packet should specify exactly what pur-
chase order information is to be included with each delivery, including the
encoding of this information on bar coding and radio frequency identifica-
tion (RFID) tags.

If suppliers habitually ignore the instructions contained within the welcome
packet, then remind them that failure to follow the rules may result in delayed
payments, or result in a lower score on any supplier scorecard system that the
company may use.

3-46 Clean Up the Supplier Master File

A company with even a modest number of suppliers will gradually build up a
considerable number of errors in its vendor master file, which can result in several
problems. First, a supplier with a missing tax identification number could be a
problem when annual 1099 forms are delivered. Also, if a supplier has multiple
records in the database, the same invoice may be entered against each supplier
name, resulting in multiple payments of the same invoice. Here is how to clean up
the file:

1. Each quarter, print a report listing, for each active supplier, every field in the
vendor master file. Use the accounting software’s report writer to avoid
printing any fields not currently in use. Once printed, any empty fields will
be easily observable. In particular, look for missing taxpayer identification
numbers and tax codes.

2. Print several variations on a duplicate names report in order to spot duplicate
vendor records. One version is sorted by supplier name, another by supplier


3-47 Adopta Supplier Naming Procedure 67

address, and yet another by taxpayer identification number (TIN). Once a
duplication is spotted, figure out which one is not being used and flag it as
archived.

3. Run a report listing all suppliers with whom the company has done no
business in the past year (or two years, depending on company policy). Flag
them as archived in order to remove them from the current vendor master
file.

4. Print a report listing all suppliers added to the file since the last review date.
Then go to www.irs.gov and click on the link to sign up for e-services. This
allows the company to access the IRS’s TIN verification program online.
Then use the IRS site to verify the TIN of all the new suppliers. Contact
suppliers if their TINs are incorrect and update the vendor master file with
this information.

3-47 Adopta Supplier Naming Procedure

As just noted in the preceding best practice, the supplier master file can become
clogged with multiple records for the same supplier, which can lead to duplicate
payments. To reduce the amount of master file review and consolidation, always
use a standard supplier naming convention to reduce the incidence of duplicate
supplier names.

The supplier naming procedure requires the payables staff to follow precisely
the same approach every time it must convert a supplier name into a supplier
identification number in the supplier master file. Here are some possible ways to
compress a supplier name into an identification code:

¢ First, strip out all spaces and punctuation marks from the supplier name.

¢ Next, eliminate all symbols from the supplier name, such as “&,” “@,” and
apostrophes.

¢ Next, use the letters in the stripped-down supplier name, starting on the left,
and proceed to the right for a predetermined number of spaces. Then add a
multidigit code at the end of this truncated name, starting at (for example)
“001” and ascending by one digit for each additional name that begins with the
same letters.

For example, a company truncates after 12 letters and then adds a three-
number code to the end. If a supplier’s name is Abercrombie & Arbuthnot, then its
supplier code will now be ABERCROMBIEAO01. If the company does business
with another supplier named Abercrombie & Arrow, then its supplier code will be
ABERCROMBIEA002.

3-48 Assign Payables Staff to Specific Suppliers

When suppliers call a company to check on the status of payments, the clerical staff
must research the information prior to giving a response. This can require a
substantial amount of clerical time, and can also yield differing replies to suppliers
if they call the company several times, resulting in supplier frustration. In addition,
incoming supplier invoices may contain special provisions that require a detailed
knowledge of the underlying purchasing contracts; otherwise, payments may be
recorded improperly.

A simple way to avoid all these problems is to assign supplier accounts to
specific accounts payable staff. By doing so, the accounting staff can individu-
ally concentrate their attention on a smaller group of suppliers, allowing them to
learn how each one presents invoices for payment and how their payment
transactions should be recorded. In addition, because of their increased knowl-
edge level, they can provide answers to supplier questions more quickly and with
greater accuracy.

This best practice is not a useful solution for very small companies, since there
may be only one payables staff person available. It also presents problems for
suppliers if their assigned staff person is not available, so the accounting manager
should consider assigning a back-up person to each account.

Cost: SF Installation time:

3-49 Create Different Supplier Accounts for Different Terms

Suppliers occasionally require different payment terms for different products or
services. For example, one product must be paid for within 30 days, while another
can be paid for sooner in exchange for an early payment discount. If so, the
accounts payable staff will have a hard time differentiating between the different
terms, resulting in errors that require yet more work to correct.

A possible solution is to create different computer master files for each set of
terms. By doing so, supplier invoices can be assigned to the appropriate supplier
account, resulting in accurate payment processing. However, this best practice still
requires knowing to which account a supplier invoice should be assigned. This
problem can be resolved by forcing the issue back to the supplier and having it
enter the correct supplier code on all submitted invoices, depending on the type of
transaction submitted.

3-50 Review Supplier Statements for Open Credits

A company may deal with a supplier over many years, and over that time it will
occasionally return products or protest incorrect billings that result in credits being
granted by the supplier. The trouble is that the supplier may not send formal notice
of the credit to the company, so the accounts payable staff has no idea that there is a
credit available that it can use to offset other billings issued by the supplier.
The solution is to request that a formal statement of outstanding invoices and
credits be sent to the company by every major supplier at least once a year. These
statements should identify all open credits, for which the accounts payable staff can
either request repayment or use as offsets to new billings. The key elements in this
best practice are (1) to monitor which suppliers refuse to send a statement, so that
follow-up action can be taken, and (2) proper review of the statements by the
accounts payable staff, which may not want to spend the extra time on this chore.

3-51 Issue Standard Adjustment Letters to Suppliers

When the accounts payable staff have a valid reason for making a deduction from a
payment to a supplier, this can result in a prolonged series of complaints from the
supplier as to why a short payment was made. The adjustment will appear on the
next monthly statement of unpaid invoices from the supplier, and will likely end
with a series of irate collection calls. At some point, the accounting staff may feel
that the cost savings from taking the deduction were not worth the effort required to
convince the supplier of the reasoning behind the adjustment.

This issue can be solved to some extent by checking off a box on a standard
adjustment letter and mailing the letter to the supplier. The letter should note the
invoice number that is at issue, as well as a series of common problems that caused
the short payment to be made. The accounting staff can quickly check off the
appropriate box and mail it out, using far less time than would be required to
construct a formal, customized letter of notification. The letter should contain
space for a free-form written description of the issue, in case it is a unique one not
covered by any of the standard explanations already listed on the letter.

Summary
This chapter itemized a number of best practices that can be used to vastly
streamline the accounts payable function, one of the most labor-intensive account-

ing functions. Of all the functional areas, this is the one that can yield the most
impressive productivity gains with the use of best practices.


70 Accounts Payable Best Practices

You can select a series of small and simple changes, such as using signature
stamps and auditing expense reports, to make incremental improvements in the
accounts payable process. However, this is an area where massive gains are
possible if a controller is willing to completely restructure the traditional accounts
payable processing approach. To this end, the most important best practice listed in
this chapter is that of paying upon receiving approval—the receiving staff
authorizes payment simply by looking up all items received in an online database
of open purchase orders. No further work is required by the accounts payable staff,
resulting in a major reduction in the accounting workload. However, this approach
requires new computer systems, as well as a complete retraining of the receiving
staff regarding their role in paying suppliers. Only through such paradigm shifts
can an accounts payable staff achieve sensational productivity improvements.

Billing Best Practices

This chapter covers the best practices that can be used to create a more efficient
billing operation. The best practices fall into three main categories. One group
covers the need for more accurate information that is used to create an invoice.
These items focus on the stream of information going from the shipping depart-
ment to the invoicing staff, with a particular emphasis on rooting out any missing
or incorrect information. The next group of best practices covers the efficiency of
the invoicing operation itself, eliminating month-end statements and using a
smaller number of multipart invoice forms. The final group focuses on changing
the method of invoice delivery to the customer, such as using electronic delivery or
allowing the delivery person to create the invoice at the point of delivery. When
taken as a whole, these best practices result in an invoicing operation that is
remarkably error free, issues invoices as soon as products are shipped, and ensures
that customers receive invoices almost at once.

Implementation Issues for Billing Best Practices

The best practices in this chapter comprise a broad mix of issues that are easily put
in place and others that are much more challenging to implement, depending on a
company’s specific circumstances. This section contains a table (Exhibit 4.1) that
lists the best practices and then describes the cost and duration of implementation
for each one. The most difficult ones are those requiring extra computer pro-
gramming to achieve, as well as those that require the cooperative efforts of other
departments. The easiest ones can generally be achieved within the accounting
department and with no additional capital or personnel costs of note.

Some of the most difficult implementation jobs result in the greatest improve-
ments in the performance of the billing function. Accordingly, it is best to alternate
easy implementations with more difficult ones so that there is a constant stream of

71

successes, some of which represent significant advances in efficiency. Also, by
including an occasional “quick-hit” implementation, a controller can point toward
a continuing stream of successes, which is useful when trying to obtain funds for
more best practices—related projects.

The remainder of this chapter describes the best practices that were itemized in
Exhibit 4.1. Each description includes the benefits and problems associated with
each best practice, as well as any implementation problems to be aware of. The
descriptions should be sufficient for the reader to form a knowledgeable opinion

4-1 Avoid Missed Billings 73

regarding the need to implement one or more of these best practices, depending on
the specific operations of the reader’s organization.

4-1 Avoid Missed Billings

One of the most serious billing problems is when shipments are made or services
delivered, and no billing is issued at all. For a variety of reasons, there are holes in the
sales process that allow documentation of sales to never reach the billing department.
Depending on the number of times this happens, the amount of lost profits can be
quite large. Here are some techniques for minimizing missed billings:

¢ Orders not entered through standard system. The sales staff sometimes
walks a customer order around the order entry department and straight to the
warehouse, just to ensure that a delivery takes place as soon as possible (or
worse, they hand-carry it to the customer, so there is also no shipping record).
When this happens, there is no record of a customer order in the computer
system, so there is no indicator of an unbilled order that would normally flag
some form of investigation by the accounting manager. The only solution is to
require everyone at every step of the order fulfillment process to force anyone
circumventing the system to return to the order entry department, where the
order will be properly entered into the system.

¢ Billable hours changed after the fact. Employees have a habit of going back
into the timekeeping system and altering their billable hours after the billing
period has closed. This problem can be avoided entirely by locking down
access to timekeeping periods in the previous month, so that no changes can
be made.

¢ Late timesheet entry. Begin reminding the staff starting on Monday to
ensure that they have entered their hours in the timekeeping system for the
preceding week. Each reminder is escalated, first to the human resources
manager, then to the local supervisor, and then to the company president. This
approach is far better than waiting until month-end to remind people, because
they tend to forget what they did if too much time has passed.

¢ Automated reminders. Have the timekeeping system automatically send
email reminders to anyone whose timesheet has not yet been entered.

¢ Shipping notices stuck together. This one sounds trivial, but have you ever
seen glue or gum sticking multiple shipping notices together? Alternatively,
they may be mistakenly clipped or stapled together, so the shipping notices on
the bottom of the stack are never seen by the billing staff, and so are never
billed. To avoid this, consider having a second billing clerk skim through the
daily batch of shipping notices from the shipping dock, and compare them to
the daily invoice run to see if any shipping notices were missed by the first
billing clerk.


74 Billing Best Practices

¢ Formalize sample shipment authorizations. Most shipping logs contain
entries for the shipment of free samples, which are usually authorized by the
marketing department. If the accounting staff is regularly reviewing the
shipping log to ensure that all shipments are billed, these special deliveries
require a considerable amount of investigation to verify. To reduce the work
level, require the marketing department to issue a sales order through the
normal order-entry system for all free deliveries, so the accounting staff can
more easily trace the authorizing documentation.

¢ What about customer on-site pickups? The standard system for invoicing
assumes that the shipping dock sends a shipping notice to the billing staff,
which triggers an invoice. But what if the customer shows up to take delivery?
This is easy enough for a retail establishment, but can cause fits for a company
whose systems are designed for freight deliveries to customers. If the solution
is manual handling of each case, then the odds of not billing a customer pickup
are extremely high. The solution is to direct customers making their own
pickups to the shipping dock so that the shipping personnel (who are the most
experienced in documenting shipments) will handle the “delivery” to the
customer and can be relied on to fill out the usual paperwork and forward it to
the billing staff in the normal manner.

4-2 Remove Unnecessary Information from Invoices

If there is too much clutter on an invoice, customers will have a difficult time
locating key information. This is a particular problem if information is included
that is used by the accounting staff but not by the customer. For example, the
header bar may include the initials of the customer’s salesperson (usually for
commission calculation purposes) and the job number. At a particularly high level
of obscurity, some accounting systems label the invoice number as something else,
such as the document number. The end result is more time spent by the customer
wading through an invoice to find the relevant information, and a greater risk that
the wrong or incorrect information will be transferred from the invoice to the
customer’s accounts payable system.

The solution is a careful review of the invoice format to strip out unnecessary
information or clarify the labeling of needed items. For example, you can usually
eliminate salesperson initials and job numbers from an invoice (which will still be
available through the accounting system). Other improvements are clarifying the
labels of various types of information, as well as revising the invoice layout into a
logical and readable format.

4-4 Do Early Billing of Recurring Invoices 75

4-3 Mark Envelopes with Address Correction Requested

Customers move to new locations all the time, and sometimes they do not notify
their suppliers of this change. When this happens, the collection process can be
significantly delayed while the collections team tracks down new addresses and
remails invoices.

A simple best practice to circumvent this problem is to mark the
words “Address Correction Requested” on each envelope mailed. If the cus-
tomer has moved and filed a forwarding address with the Postal Service, the
Postal Service will forward the mail to the new address and also notify the
company of the new address, which can then be updated in the customer address
file at once. The Postal Service will charge a small fee for this notification
service.

If for some reason the company does not want its mail to be forwarded, it can
instead mark envelopes with the words “Address Correction Requested—Do Not
Forward.” This will result in not only the return of the mail but also a notice of the
forwarding address.

4-4 Do Early Billing of Recurring Invoices

There are many situations in which a company knows the exact amount of a
customer billing well before the date on which the invoice is to be sent. For
example, a subscription is for the preset amount, as is a contractual obligation, such
as a rent payment. In these cases, it makes sense to create the invoice and deliver it
to the customer one or two weeks in advance of the date when it is actually due. By
doing so, the invoice has more time to be routed through the receiving organiza-
tion, passing through the mailroom, accounting staff, authorized signatory, and
back to the accounts payable staff for payment. This makes it much more likely that
the invoice will be paid on time, which improves cash flow and reduces a
company’s investment in accounts receivable.

The main difficulty with advance billings is that the date of the invoice
should be shifted forward to the accounting period in which the invoice is
supposed to be billed. Otherwise, the revenue will be recognized too early,
which distorts the financial statements. Shifting the accounting period forward
is not difficult for most accounting software systems, but the controller must
remember to shift back to the current period after the invoice processing has
been completed; otherwise, all other current transactions that are subsequently
entered will be recorded in the next accounting period, rather than the current
one.

76 Billing Best Practices

4-5 Have the Sales Staff Review Contact Information for
Recurring Invoices

Many companies issue invoices in the same amounts to the same customers at the
same addresses for years. These situations typically arise for maintenance or
subscription products. Through the natural attrition of customer employees and
changes in customer locations, it is inevitable that the contact information that was
correct the month or year before for the last billing is no longer correct. This results
in returned mail and delays while the accounting or sales departments determine to
whom the invoice should now be sent.

A good solution is to print out the list of invoices to be sent in the near future
and have the sales staff review the list for errors before printing the invoices. The
sales staff typically has the most current contact information, and so they are most
likely to spot outdated information.

The primary difficulty with this best practice is the unwillingness of the sales
staff to assist in the invoice review process. You can personally meet with the sales
staff to personally impress on them the importance of this task. An alternative is to
verify with the sales staff the contact information for only the largest invoices,
thereby keeping the allocation of their valuable time to this task to a minimum. A
better approach is to grant the sales staff a small commission based on the cash
collected from recurring invoices. By doing so, they will see a more immediate
need to ensure the accuracy of all contact information.

4-6 Review Billed Hours Early

When a company bills the time of its employees to customers on a monthly basis, a
major bottleneck at month-end is to compile all of these hours, ensure that the hour
totals are correct, verify that there is sufficient contract funding available, and then
issue invoices. These invoices also tend to be complex, so additional proofreading
is required to avoid the rejection of invoices.

A good way to reduce the severity of this workload at month-end is to shift
some of the task forward by a few days. By doing so, the billing staff can examine
the hours billed information that has so far been posted to the company’s time and
billing system, and notify employees if any time is missing or appears to have been
recorded incorrectly. In addition, this is a good time to review the remaining
funding that is available on each customer project so that employees can be
contacted if it appears that they may run over the allowed number of hours. Dealing
with these issues early does not remove them from the month-end billing process
but should mitigate the severity of the month-end workload.

4-7 Issue Electronic Invoices 77

4-7 Issue Electronic Invoices

The traditional invoicing process is extraordinarily wasteful in terms of the effort
and time that goes into creating and issuing an invoice. It must be created and
inserted into an invoice-printing batch, which, in turn, requires the use of a
customized invoice with prepositioned fields and logos, plus a review of the
printed invoices, stuffing into envelopes, affixing postage, and mailing. Even then,
there is a risk that the invoice will be lost in the mail, either due to a problem at the
post office or because the recipient’s address has changed. Further, there are delays
at the receiving company, while the mailroom sorts through the mail and delivers it
internally (sometimes to the wrong person).

The best solution is to “push” electronic invoices to customers by e-mail. This
requires the collection of an e-mail address from each customer at the time an order
is taken (or verification of an existing one when a reorder occurs). This address is
then attached to an electronic invoice form that is generated, instead of a paper-
based invoice, and issued to the customer over the Internet. It is then available to
the customer a few moments later, allowing for immediate payment (possibly) or at
least a quick perusal of the invoice and a return of information to the company
regarding any problems discovered by the customer. This approach greatly reduces
the time required to get invoicing information to the customer.

There are several problems with Internet invoicing to be aware of. First, some
customers change their e-mail addresses with some regularity, so there is a chance
that invoices will be sent to an old address, and therefore never accessed. Also,
there is some risk that customers will accidentally erase an incoming electronic
invoice without reviewing it. Furthermore, this approach leaves no paper record of
the invoice at the company, just a computer record; this is a problem for those
organizations where the collections effort is primarily based on paper files, rather
than ready access to the accounting database.

Some of the problems with e-mailed invoices can be addressed through the
careful analysis of which customers reliably pay their invoices by this means and
(more importantly) which do not. If there is a consistent problem with payment by
some customers, they can be flagged in the accounting database and a traditional
paper-based invoice can be created for them. Alternatively, the same invoices can
be continually reissued every week or two by e-mail. This is a zero-cost option,
since there are no mailing or printing costs. When using this approach, the entire
file of unpaid invoices can be reissued electronically to customers. However, to
avoid multiple payments for the same invoices, it may be useful to alter the format
of these secondary issuances so that they are clearly labeled as reminder invoices.
An alternative format is to cluster all unpaid invoices for each customer into an
electronic statement of unpaid invoices, which can be issued at regular intervals.

A variation on the use of electronic invoices through the Internet is the use of a
consolidator. This is an entity that maintains a web site that allows a company’s
customers to access not only their billings, but those of their other suppliers, too.
This approach has the distinct advantage of allowing customers to pay a number of


78 Billing Best Practices

different bills at the same time, without switching to a number of different web sites
in order to do so.

A company that wishes to have its invoices posted on a consolidator web site
must create a data file that reformats the invoice information into the format needed
by the consolidator, and then send this file over the Internet to the consolidator,
which then posts the information. Customers then access their invoices in a
summary format, which are clustered together for all of their suppliers, and either
accept or reject them for payment; if there is a problem, customers can access
greater levels of detail for each invoice, and usually access an e-mail account that
will be sent to the company’s customer service department.

The cost of this service varies considerably by consolidator, with some
charging the customer, some the company, and some charging both. It is best
to refer to the fee schedule of each one to determine the precise amounts. The fees
charged to a company are not excessive, and should not get in the way of adopting
this option.

The main problem with using a consolidator is that not all customers will want
to use the one to which the company prefers to send its invoicing information, since
they may have already set up payment plans with many of their other suppliers
through different consolidators. Accordingly, a company may find itself issuing
invoice files to a large number of consolidators, which presents additional work for
the person reformatting the invoice file.

4-8 Issue Single, Summarized Invoices Each Period

Some companies make a business out of selling small quantities of products in
small batches, which necessitates a very large quantity of invoices. For example, a
company that sells nails in batches of an ounce per sale will issue 16 more invoices
than one that sells nails in batches of no less than one pound. If the cost of issuing
an invoice is as little as $1 (and it is usually much more), then the price at which the
nails were sold will probably be far less than the cost of issuing the associated
invoices. Clearly, companies that must issue enormous numbers of invoices in this
manner will find that their administrative costs are excessive.

A way out of this dilemma is to group all sales for a specified time period, such
as a month, and then issue a single invoice that covers all of the sales during that
period. This approach is similar to the invoicing method used by credit card
companies, which congregate all sales for a full month and then issue a single
billing. By using this best practice, a company can eliminate a very large
proportion of its total invoice volume.

There are some issues to consider before using this best practice. One is that
this approach is obviously most suitable for companies that issue large quantities of
low-dollar invoices. Conversely, it is not a reasonable approach if invoice volume


4-9 Print Separate Invoices for Each Line Item 79

is low and dollar volumes are high. If a billing is for a large amount of money, it
makes little sense to wait until the end of the month to issue an invoice, since this
only delays the time period before the customer will pay for it. Another issue is
that the existing accounting software may not support this feature. If not, a
company must go through the added expense of custom programming to group a
series of shipments or sales into a single invoice. Another problem may be
customers—they are accustomed to receiving a single invoice for each shipment,
with a separate purchase order authorizing each invoice, and they will not know
what to do when a single, summary-level invoice arrives in the mail. The best
way to resolve this problem is to make it an option for customers to accept
summary-level invoices, rather than unexpectedly springing it on them with no
warning and requiring their use of it. By taking the time to explain the reason for
the single invoice and how it can benefit customers, too (with less paperwork for
them to sort through), the customer acceptance rate should be quite high. The
final problem with this method is that it takes longer to bring cash in to pay for
shipped goods, since some shipments may be sent out at the beginning of a
month, but not billed until the end of the month. To avoid this problem, a
company can impose a shorter due date in which customers must pay, though
customers rarely receive this well. Instead, it is best to carefully analyze the
interest cost of the large amount of committed working capital to the reduced
cost of invoicing; if there is a clear benefit despite the added cost, then this best
practice should be implemented.

In short, issuing a single invoice to customers each period makes a great deal
of sense for those companies that ship many small-dollar orders. Companies that
deal with large-dollar orders should probably leave this best practice alone, since
there is an added working capital cost associated with its use.

4-9 Print Separate Invoices for Each Line Item

When an accounting department issues an invoice containing a large number of
line items, it is more likely that the recipient will have an issue with one or more of
the line items, and will hold payment on the entire invoice while those line items
are resolved. Though this may not be a significant issue when an invoice is
relatively small, it is a large issue indeed when the invoice has a large dollar total,
and holding the entire invoice will have a serious impact on the amount of accounts
receivable outstanding.

One way to avoid this problem is to split large invoices into separate ones,
with each invoice containing just one line item. By doing so, it is more likely that
some invoices will be paid at once, while other ones for which there are issues will
be delayed. This can have a significant positive impact on a company’s investment
in accounts receivable.


80 Billing Best Practices

The only complaint that arises from this approach is that customers can be
buried under quite a large pile of invoices. This can be ameliorated by clustering all
of the invoices in a single envelope, rather than sending a dozen separately mailed
invoices on the same day. Also, it may be prudent to cluster small-dollar line items
on the same invoice, since this will cut down on the number of invoices issued,
while not having a significant impact on the overall receivable balance if these
invoices are put on hold.

4-10 Enhance the Invoice Layout

Many companies lose sight of a simple philosophical issue involving the invoice—
itis for the customer’s sole use, not theirs. This means that the company should not
make the invoice layout so difficult to read that the customer’s accounting staff
cannot enter the invoice into its computer system without a great deal of perusal.
The usual result is incorrect or delayed payments.

The solution is to simplify the format and general presentation of the invoice
in order to make it as simple as possible for the recipient to understand. Here are
some examples of proper invoice structure:

¢ Eliminate graphics and shading. Fancy images may look pretty, but if the
customer is trying to scan the invoice into a document imaging system, this
may result in an unreadable gray blob. Even if information is only being
manually translated from the invoice to the customer’s computer system,
invoice graphics will still be a distraction, and could interfere with data entry.

¢ Present the invoice number as clearly as possible. Many companies put
their own tracking number or document index number next to the invoice
number. Customers frequently mix up these numbers, and enter the wrong
number in their computer systems in place of the invoice number. If document
tracking numbers must be included on an invoice, then at least keep them out
of the upper right corner of the document, which is where customers expect to
see the invoice number. Better yet, convert the tracking number to a bar code,
which customers cannot read.

¢ List the early payment or late payment amount well away from the
invoice total. If all these different payment totals are clustered together, it is
too easy for the customer’s payables staff to enter the wrong one as the payable
amount.

¢ Clearly show contact information. If there is a problem with an invoice, the
customer does not want to use the White Pages to locate your headquarters. Do
them a large favor and clearly show the accounting department’s phone
number on the invoice. Also, make sure that someone in the accounting

department checks the voice mail for this phone number every day, in order to
provide better customer service.

4-11 Add Receipt Signature to Invoice

There may be cases where customers demand proof of their receipt of a delivery
from the company before they will pay its invoice. Normally, this proof is
generated internally by the customer through the use of a receiving log or the
forwarding of bill of lading information to the accounting department. However,
there are cases where there is a paperwork disconnect between the customer’s
accounting and receiving functions so that some company invoices are not paid
for long periods of time, while the customer scrambles to find evidence of
receipt.

This problem can be reduced by using either FedEx or United Parcel Service
to make deliveries, since both organizations post receipt signatures on their web
sites. You can then copy the signature images out of the web sites and paste them
directly into an invoice, thereby providing proof of receipt to the customer on the
invoice. If necessary, the billing staff can also add the delivery reference number
used by either United Parcel Service or FedEx to the invoice. Either the customer
or the company can then go straight to the web sites of either package delivery
company to obtain further evidence of the time and place of delivery of the package
in question. This approach has the distinct advantage of consolidating both the
billing and receiving information for a delivery on one piece of paper. The
downside is that the invoice cannot be issued until the delivery has been received
by the customer, rather than being sent when the package leaves the company’s
premises. Also, you must always use either of these package delivery companies in
order to have access to the signature information, when there may be less
expensive shipping options available.

4-12 Automatically Check Errors during Invoice Data Entry

Errors during the data-entry phase of creating an invoice can result in a variety of
downstream problems. For example, an incorrect billing address on an invoice
means that the customer will never receive it, which means that the collections staff
must send a new invoice copy. Also, if the quantity, product description, or price is
entered incorrectly, the customer may have a good reason for not paying the bill. If
this happens, the collections staff will have to get involved to work out the reason
for nonpayment and negotiate extra payments (if possible) by customers. All of


82 Billing Best Practices

these problems are exceptions and require very large amounts of time to research
and fix.

A useful best practice is to prevent as many data-entry problems in advance as
possible by using computerized data-checking methods. For example, a field for
zip codes can accept only five-digit or nine-digit numbers, which prevents the entry
of numbers of an unusual length. The field can also be tied to a file of all cities and
states so that entering a zip code automatically fills in the city and state fields. Also,
prices of unusual length can be automatically rejected, or prices can be automati-
cally called up from a file that is linked to a product number. Similarly, product
descriptions can be automatically entered if the product number is entered. An
example of a “smart” data-entry system is one that flags part numbers that are being
entered for an existing customer for the first time. The computer can check the part
number entered against a file of items previously ordered by a customer and see if
there is a chance that the part being ordered might not be the correct one. There can
also be required fields that must have a valid entry or else the invoice cannot be
processed; a good example is the customer purchase order number field, which is
required by many customers, or else they will not pay the invoice. By including
these automatic error-checking and expert systems into the data-entry software, it
is possible to reduce the number of data-entry errors.

The main problem with creating automatic error-checking is that it can be a
significant programming project. There may be a dozen different error-checking
protocols linked to the invoice data-entry screen, and each one is a separate
programming project. Also, if a company purchased its software from a third party,
itis common for the company to periodically install software updates issued by the
supplier, which would wipe out any programming changes made in the interim.
Accordingly, it is best to apply these error-checking routines only to custom-
programmed accounting systems. An alternative is to use error checking as a
criterion for the purchase of new packaged software, if a company is in the market
for a new accounting system. In either of these cases, having automatic error
checking is a worthy addition to an accounting system.

4-13 Proofread Invoices

Some invoices are so complex—involving the entry of purchase order numbers,
many line items, price discounts, and other credits—that it is difficult to create a
perfect invoice. This is a particular problem when employee expenses are sent to a
customer for reimbursement and the submitted expenses are incomplete or
inaccurate. When a complex invoice is sent to the customer, the customer ends
up being the proofreader and rejects the invoice until the company goes through


4-14 Have Delivery Person Create the Invoice 83

more delays and eventually issues an accurate invoice. The time delay can be
substantial.

The solution is to assign a second person to be the invoice proofreader. This
person does not create the invoice, and so can provide a more independent view of
invoice accuracy. The reviewer will do a better job if he or she uses a checklist of
items that should be included in each invoice. Since this can introduce some delay
into the invoice-creation process, proofreading could be limited to only complex
invoices or to invoices sent to those customers most apt to comb through them
looking for mistakes.

Proofreading is of particular concern when an invoice is being prepared in a
foreign language. If incorrectly written to the point of being incomprehensible or at
least misunderstood by the recipient, then this can cause major delays in payment.
A solution is to have one person create the initial translation, and then have a
second person review the translation. Ideally, one person would be a bilingual
English-speaking native, and the other person would be a bilingual foreign
translator from the country where the invoice is to be sent. This provides different
views of the same text.

4-14 Have Delivery Person Create the Invoice

Many companies have difficulty with their customers when the company bills for
the quantity that it believes it shipped to the customer, but the customer argues that
it received a different quantity and only pays for the amount it believes it has
received. This problem results in the invoicing staff having to issue credits after
the fact in order to reconcile the amount of cash received from customers to the
amounts billed to them. The amount of work required in these cases to match the
amounts billed to the amounts paid is usually greatly in excess of the dollar amounts
involved and has a profound impact on the efficiency of the billing staff.

New technology makes it possible for some companies to completely bypass
this problem. If a company has its own delivery staff, it can equip them with
portable computers and printers and have them issue invoices at the point of
receipt, using the quantities counted by the customer as the appropriate amount to
invoice. A flowchart of the procedure is shown in Exhibit 4.2 . To begin, the shipping
staff determines the amount to be shipped to a customer and enters this amount into
the main accounting database. The amount in a specific truckload is downloaded
into the portable computer of the delivery person, who then brings the truckload of
goods to the customer. The customer counts the amount received. The delivery
person calls up the amount of the delivery on the screen of the portable computer,
enters the quantities that the customer agrees has been received, and prints out
and delivers an invoice (which may be on a diskette or compact disc if the customer
has a compatible computer system that can receive invoice data in this fashion).

The delivery person then returns to the company and uploads all invoicing
information from the portable computer to the main accounting database, which
records the invoices and notes any variances between the amounts shipped and
the amounts received by customers (which will be investigated if the variances
are significant). It is also possible to upload information at the customer site,
usually by dialing up the accounting database through a wireless connection or
by using local Wi-Fi access. This process is capable of eliminating problems
caused by customer disputes over delivered quantities, resulting in less work for
the accounting staff.

Though a technologically elegant solution, this best practice is one that applies
to only a small number of companies that meet some very specific criteria. First, a
company must make deliveries with its own staff; a third-party delivery service


4-15 Computerize the Shipping Log 85

will not perform the on-site invoicing function. Next, this solution requires a good
knowledge of computer systems to implement. There must be not only a qualified
and knowledgeable in-house computer system department but also one that has the
budget to create such a system. Also, this is an expensive solution to implement
(if only because every driver must be furnished with a computer and printer), so
there must be a clear trade-off between the implementation and capital cost of the
system and benefits from reduced accounting staff labor. These criteria tend to
point toward only larger companies that make frequent deliveries to a large number
of customers. Smaller firms will not find that this is a cost-effective practice to
install and use.

4-15 Computerize the Shipping Log

For a company with no computer linkage to the shipping dock, the typical sequence
of events leading up to the creation of an invoice is that copies of the packing slip and
the initial customer order form are manually delivered to the accounting department
from the shipping dock; then the accounting staff uses this information to create an
invoice. Unfortunately, this manual transfer of information can sometimes lead to
missing documents, which means that the accounting department does not create an
invoice and sales are lost. In addition, this system can be a slow one—if the shipping
department is a long way away from the accounting department, perhaps in a
different city, it may be several days before the invoice can be created, which
increases the time period before a customer will receive the invoice and pay it.
Finally, there is a problem with data entry, because the accounting staff must
manually reenter some or all of the customer information before creating an invoice
(depending on the amount of data already entered into the computer system by the
order-entry department). Any additional data entry brings up the risk of incorrect
information being entered on an invoice, which may result in collection problems,
especially if the data-entry error related to an incorrect shipment quantity.

The solution is to provide for the direct entry of shipping information by the
shipping staff at the shipping location. By doing so, there is no longer any time
delay in issuing invoices, nor is there a risk that the accounting staff will incorrectly
enter shipping information into an invoice. There is still a risk that the shipping
staff will incorrectly enter information, but this is less likely because they are the
ones who shipped the product and they are most familiar with shipping quantities
and other related information. For this system to function properly, there must be a
computer terminal in the shipping area that is directly linked to the accounting
database. In addition, the shipping staff must be properly trained in how to enter a
shipment into the computer. There should also be a continuing internal audit
review of the accuracy of the data entered at this location, to ensure that the


86 Billing Best Practices

procedure is handled correctly. Finally, the accounting software should have a data
input screen that allows the shipping staff to enter shipping information. These
tend to be minor problems at most companies, since there is usually a computer
terminal already in or near the shipping area, and most accounting packages are
already set up to handle the direct entry of shipping information; some even do so
automatically as soon as the shipping staff creates a bill of lading or packing slip
through the computer system. In short, unless there are very antiquated systems on
hand or a poorly trained or unreliable shipping staff, it is not normally a very
difficult issue to have the shipping employees directly enter shipping information
into the accounting system, which can then be used to immediately create and issue
invoices.

4-16 Track Exceptions between the Shipping Log and
the Invoice Register

If a company relies on the manual transfer of shipping information from the
shipping dock to the accounting department, it is likely that some shipments are
never billed, resulting in a permanent loss of revenue. This situation arises because
information can be lost on its way from the shipping dock; it can be mixed with
other paperwork, put into the wrong bin, given to the wrong person, or any number
of other variations. In even the best-run companies, there is a strong chance that,
from time to time, a shipment will not be invoiced. If the shipment in question is a
high-dollar one, the cost of the missing transaction can be considerable and may
make it worthwhile to take steps to remedy the situation.

Fortunately, the solution is not a very expensive one. To avoid any missing
invoices, continually compare the shipping log maintained by the shipping
department with the invoice register maintained by the accounting department.
Any shipment listed on the shipping log that has not been invoiced must be
investigated at once. There may be good reasons for a shipment that is not
invoiced, such as the delivery of a free sample, but the investigation must still be
completed to ensure that there are no problems. If a problem is uncovered, it is not
enough to just issue the missing invoice. You must also determine the reason that
the paperwork for the shipment never reached the accounting department and fix
the underlying problem. Only by taking this extra step can a company keep from
having a continual problem with its invoicing. Any company using a manual
transfer of information between these two departments should always track
exceptions between the shipping log and invoice register.

It is also possible to avoid the entire problem by having the shipping
department record all shipments directly into the accounting database, as described
in the best practice 4-15, “Computerize the Shipping Log.” By using this
approach, there is no manual transfer of information, so there is no exception


4-18 Reduce Number of Parts in Multipart Invoices 87

tracking to perform. It is also possible to have the shipping department not only
enter shipments into the computer but also print out invoices in the shipping
department for delivery with the shipments. This approach was also described
earlier, in best practice 4-14, “Have Delivery Person Create the Invoice.”
However, if the shipping area does not have the level of computerization or
training to use either of these more advanced best practices, a periodic comparison
of the shipping log to the invoice register is mandatory, in order to avoid not billing
customers for shipments to them.

Cost: HF Installation time:

4-17 Eliminate Month-End Statements

The employees in charge of printing and issuing invoices each day have another
document that they print and issue each month, the month-end statement. This is a
listing of all open invoices that customers have not yet paid. Though it seems like a
good idea to tell customers what they still owe, the reality of the situation is that
most customers throw away their statements without reading them. The reason is
that the person receiving a statement, the accounts payable clerk, does not have
time to research strange invoices that appear on a supplier’s statement, nor is it
likely that this person will call the supplier to request a copy of a missing invoice.
Instead, it is easier to wait for a contact from the supplier, asking about a specific
invoice. By waiting, the onus of doing some work falls on the supplier instead of
the accounts payable person, which is a preferable shifting of the workload from
the latter person to the former.

The simple approach to eliminating this problem is to stop printing statements.
By doing so, you can avoid not only the time and effort of printing the statements
but also eliminate the cost of the special form used to print the statements, as well
as the cost of stuffing them in envelopes and mailing them. Though it is possible
that the collections staff may complain that this collection tool is being taken away
from them, it is at best a poor method for bringing in errant accounts receivable,
and does little to reduce the workload of the collections personnel. Thus,
eliminating the periodic issuance of statements to customers is an easy way to
shift the accounting staff away from a non-value-added activity, which gives them
time to pursue other more meaningful activities.

4-18 Reduce Number of Parts in Multipart Invoices

Some invoices have the thickness of a small magazine when they are printed
because they have so many parts. The top copy (or even the top two copies)


88 Billing Best Practices

usually goes to the customer, while another one goes into a file that is sorted
alphabetically; another goes into a file for invoices that is sorted by invoice
number, and yet another copy may go to a different department, such as
customer service so that it will have an additional copy on hand in case a
customer calls with a question. This plethora of invoice copies causes several
problems. One is that the printer is much more likely to jam if the number of
invoice copies running through it is too thick. Another much more serious
problem is that each of those copies must be filed away. The alphabetical copy is
probably a necessary one, since all of the shipping documentation is attached to
it, but there is no excuse for filing invoices in numerical order; they can be found
just as easily by calling them up in the computer. A final problem is that
multipart forms are more expensive.

The best practice that avoids this problem is to reduce the number of invoice
copies. Only one copy should go to the customer, and one copy should be retained.
That is two copies, not the four or five that some companies use. By reducing the
number of copies, there is much less chance that the printer will jam, and the cost of
the invoices can be substantially reduced. The biggest cost saving, however, is of
the filing time that has been eliminated, which can be many hours per month,
depending on the volume of invoices created.

The biggest objection to reducing the number of invoice copies is from those
parts of the company accustomed to using them. This group is rarely the
accounting department, which must do the work of filing the extra copies, but
rather other departments that have an occasional need to look at them. The best
way to overcome these objections is to educate the dissenters in advance regarding
the required filing time needed to keep extra copies, so they understand that the
cost of additional filing does not match the benefit of their occasional need for
the invoices. Another option is to give these people read-only access to invoices
in the accounting computer system, so they can call up invoice information on
their computers, rather than looking for it manually in an invoice binder. The
combination of these two approaches usually eliminates any opposition to reduc-
ing the number of invoice copies, allowing the accounting staff to achieve extra
efficiencies.

Summary

This chapter focused on improving the speed and accuracy of invoice preparation
and delivery. There are several ways to achieve these goals. One is to increase
the accuracy of invoicing information reaching the accounting department, which
calls for changes in the shipping department, as well as the method for transferring
shipping information to the accounting department.


Summary 89

Another set of methods involve how invoices are transmitted to customers.
Newer technologies allow you to do so electronically or at the point of delivery so
that customers receive more accurate invoices more quickly than ever before.
Finally, invoices can be completely eliminated in a limited number of cases,
resulting in direct cash transfers from customer bank accounts to the company.
When used together, these best practices result in a significant improvement in the
efficiency of the billing function.

Budgeting Best Practices

Many companies find the budgeting process to be excruciatingly slow and painful,
requiring many months of continual effort before a reasonable budget document is
completed. Once it is done, they wonder why the company went to all the effort,
since no one makes a strong effort to follow it. This chapter addresses both
problems. There are a variety of best practices focusing on creating and imple-
menting a budget model, ranging from defining capacity levels and step-costing
points to using activity-based budgeting. These are designed not only to make the
budgeting process simpler but also to result in a better budget that closely reflects
management’s expectations regarding operations in the upcoming budget period.
In addition, there are several best practices that can improve a company’s usage of
the budget so that it is closely integrated into daily operations.

This chapter begins with an overview of implementation issues for all of the
best practices, followed by a discussion of individual best practices, each one being
presented in a separate section.

Implementation Issues for Budgeting Best Practices

 

With few exceptions, improvements to the budgeting system are easy to implement
and can be done rapidly, with a minimum of fuss. The cost and duration are noted
in Exhibit 5.1. The reason is that most changes are to the budgeting model and
procedures, neither of which are under the control of anyone but the accounting
department, and neither of which need, unlike humans, some explanation and
cooperation. Accordingly, you can assume a rapid implementation process that can
mostly be completed during the current budget cycle, resulting in immediate and
rapid improvement in the entire process.

There are only three best practices requiring a considerable amount of
implementation effort. One is linking the budget to the purchase order system,
since this usually requires some custom programming. The second is switching to
an activity-based budget model, since this approach requires a complete revamping
of the budget model, as well as a new chart of accounts to reflect the changes. The
third is the installation of budgeting and planning software, which is particularly
difficult for multilocation companies. With these exceptions, you can expect best
practice implementations in this area to be an easy chore, resulting in quick
improvements.

5-1 Link the Budget to Key Business Drivers

In many businesses, the budgeting process has acquired a reputation for a great
deal of political infighting, because managers push very hard to ensure that their
capital and department budget requests are approved before those of other
managers, while also obtaining the lowest possible performance goals for the
upcoming year. Thus, it appears that the budget is driven by the most politically
astute and well-connected managers.

A much better approach is to link the budget to the overall corporate strategy,
as represented by a set of key business drivers. By doing so, it is much more
difficult for managers to twist the budget in their favor, when doing so clearly
undermines the corporate strategy. For example, a car company’s president may
have concluded that the use of alternative fuels is the company’s best hope for
survival, so key business drivers for this strategy will be the development of an
engine that can handle multiple fuels, a hybrid car, and the creation of a hydrogen-
powered fuel cell. With all available funding going into these targeted activities, it
will become painfully obvious if someone attempts to divert funding into the
development of a low-fuel economy sport-utility vehicle.

The incorporation of business drivers into the budgeting process also tends to
reduce the time period required to complete the budget, since less time is spent on
political battles and budgeting minutia.

The main problem with this approach is that managers can simply shift their
political maneuvering into altering the company strategy to best serve their personal
objectives. It takes a strong company president to overcome this maneuvering and
ensure that the correct strategy and related business drivers are selected.

5-2 Clearly Define All Assumptions

When the budget model is first presented to senior management, the person doing
the presenting is deluged with questions about what assumptions are used in the


94 Budgeting Best Practices

model. Examples of assumptions that can cause problems are tax rate percentages,
sales growth rates (especially by product line, since some of those lines may be
exceedingly mature), capacity levels (see the next section), cost-of-goods-sold
margins, commission rates, and medical insurance rates per person. Upper
management wants to make sure that all assumptions are reasonable before
they spend a great deal of their time reviewing the presented information. If there
are specious assumptions, they will probably kick the budget back and demand
changes before they will agree to look at it.

The best way around this problem is to list all key assumptions either right at
the top of the budget model or else in clearly noted spots on each page. It is also
helpful to note how these assumptions have changed from previous years, either by
providing this information in a commentary or by showing prior year information
in an extra column in the budget. By providing this information as clearly as
possible, there will be fewer questions for the budgeting team to answer.

An even better approach is to tie as many of these assumptions into the budget
model as possible so that a change to an assumption will result in an immediate
ripple effect through the budget. For example, changing a tax rate assumption will
immediately alter the tax expense in the budget, while altering the medical expense
per person will have a similar impact on personnel costs. Linking assumptions to
the budget allows one to make nearly instantaneous changes to a budget with
minimal effort.

5-3 Clearly Define All Capacity Levels

When creating a budget that contains major increases in revenues, a common
problem is failing to reflect this change in the rest of the budget, resulting in an
inadequate amount of staffing, machinery, or facilities to handle the added growth.
For example, a planned increase in revenue requires a corresponding increase in
the number of sales staff who are responsible for bringing in the sales, not to
mention a time lag before the new sales personnel can be reasonably expected to
acquire new sales. Similarly, new sales at a production facility may result in
machine utilization levels that are too high to maintain—has anyone thought of
adding machinery purchases to the budget? This problem can be turned around and
dealt with from the point of view of planned expense reductions, too—if the
percentage of direct labor is budgeted to decline due to the use of automation, has
anyone included the cost of the automation in the budget, and has a suitable time
lag been built into the plan to account for the ramp-up time needed to implement
the automation? Some of these problems are present in all but the best budget
models.

The best practice that resolves this issue is the definition of capacity levels in
the budget model. This can take the form of a table in the budget, such as the one

Machine operator 1 per 2 presses 1 per 1.7 presses

Salesperson 1 per $1,200,000 sales 1 per $1,174,000 sales

Shipper 1 per 12 truck ships/day 1 per 9 truck ships/day

 

shown in Exhibit 5.2. This example notes the capacity levels for staff power, such
as a specific number of shipments per warehouse worker, sales per salesperson, and
new product releases per engineer. It is very important to list these capacity levels
for previous years in the same table, providing a frame of reference that tells the
reader if the assumed capacity levels in this year’s budget are attainable. Also,
consider including another comparison column in the table that shows the capacity
levels of competitors or of best practice companies, against which the company has
benchmarked its activities. By using this informational layout, one can easily tell if
more or less resources are needed to attain the revenue and expense goals in a
budget.

5-4 Establish Project Ranking Criteria

When it comes time for the annual budget process, the accounting staff is usually
inundated with a flood of requests for funding capital projects. These are
sometimes pet projects, others are for repairs or replacements, and still others
are entirely new business propositions. The trouble is that a great deal of time is
spent in sorting through them to see which ones are viable. Further, after the
remaining ones are put in the budget, capital constraints typically lead to some of
them being thrown back out. As a result, capital projects can be a bottleneck during
the formation of the budget.

You can reduce this bottleneck by establishing project ranking criteria in
advance and distributing this information to anyone who may be submitting a
capital request. These criteria should itemize how funds will be allocated. For
example, any project with a return on capital that exceeds a target level is a top
priority; next in line may be any project needed to bring a company in line with
government regulations, and so on. Once they see the criteria, budget participants


96 Budgeting Best Practices

may voluntarily eliminate some of their own requests. In addition, if the capital
expenditure request form accompanies the ranking criteria, applicants can fill out
all the information the accounting staff needs to sort through the various projects,
making the accountant’s jobs much easier. This method not only eliminates some
of the least probable capital projects up front but also does a better job of
categorizing those that are left.

The traditional capital budgeting approach involves having the management team
review a series of unrelated requests from throughout the company, each one
asking for funding for various projects. Management decides whether to fund each
request based on the discounted cash flows projected for each one. If there are not
sufficient funds available for all requests having positive discounted cash flows,
then those with the largest cash flows or highest percentage returns are usually
accepted first, until the funds run out.

There are several problems with this type of capital budgeting. First and most
important, there is no consideration of how each requested project fits into the entire
system of production. Instead, most requests involve the local optimization of
specific work centers that may not contribute to the total throughput of the company.
Second, there is no consideration of the constrained resource, so managers cannot tell
which funding requests will result in an improvement to the efficiency of that
operation. Third, managers tend to engage in a great deal of speculation regarding the
budgeted cash flows resulting from their requests, resulting in inaccurate discounted
cash flow projections. Since many requests involve unverifiable cash flow estimates,
it is impossible to discern which projects are better than others.

A greater reliance on throughput accounting concepts eliminates most of these
problems. First, the priority for funding should be placed squarely on any projects
that can improve the capacity of the constrained resource, based on a comparison
of the incremental additional throughput created to the incremental operating
expenses and investment incurred.

Second, any investment requests not involving the constrained resource
should be subject to an intensive critical review, likely resulting in their rejection.
Since they do not impact the constrained resource, these investments cannot impact
system throughput in any way, so their sole remaining justification must be the
reduction of operating expenses or the mitigation of some type of risk.

The one exception to investing in nonconstraint resources is when there is so
little excess capacity in a work center that it has difficulty recovering from
downtime. This can be a major problem if the lack of capacity constantly causes
holes in the inventory buffer and places the constrained resource in danger of
running out of work. In this case, a good investment alternative is to invest in a


5-6 Establish the Upper Limit of Available Funding 97

sufficient amount of additional sprint capacity to ensure that the system can rapidly
recover from a reasonable level of downtime. If managers are applying for a capital
investment based on this reasoning, they should attach a chart to the proposal that
shows the capacity level at which the targeted resource has been operating over the
past few months, as well as the severity of holes in the buffer caused by that
operation.

At what point should a company invest in more of the constrained resource? In
many cases, the company has specifically designated a resource to be its constraint
because it is so expensive to add additional capacity, so this decision is not to be
taken lightly. The decision process is to review the impact on the incremental
change in throughput caused by the added investment, less any changes in
operating expenses. Because this type of investment represents a considerable
step-cost (where costs and/or the investment will jump considerably as a result of
the decision), management must usually make its decision based on the perceived
level of long-term throughput changes, rather than smaller expected short-term
throughput increases.

5-6 Establish the Upper Limit of Available Funding

Too many budgeting processes take an inordinate amount of time to complete
because management goes through too many iterations while deciding on how
much money it has to spend. For example, the initial budget model may include
funding for a new facility, an acquisition, or a distribution to stockholders.
However, once management determines that the amount of available funding is
not sufficient, it must recast the budget in order to arrive at a much smaller total
expenditure. This plays havoc with the accounting staff, who must coordinate all
the budgeting changes, modify the model, and reissue it.

The answer is to determine the amount of available funding as early in the
process as possible. For example, the amount of fixed assets, inventory, and
accounts receivable currently on hand can be extrapolated into the next year to
determine the total amount of borrowing base that is likely to be available for
borrowing purposes. Also, you can inquire of senior management if there is any
likelihood of making a public offering of shares or of making a bond placement in
the near future; this option is most unlikely for smaller companies, while larger
ones may be constrained by established policies regarding the suitable debt-to-
equity ratio that management is not allowed to exceed. Finally, the company may
spin off cash from continuing operations; a review of current margin levels and
cash flows can be used to determine the level of funds originating from this source.
When all of these sources are put together, management usually finds that there is
far less money available than they had wished for, which keeps them from
developing overblown budgets that cannot possibly succeed.


98 Budgeting Best Practices

The only issue with this approach is that some managers like to produce
budgets that represent flights of fancy and do not appreciate having the extra
information regarding funding, since it brings them back to reality rather abruptly.
When these unique personalities are in management, it is best to use a great deal of
tact when presenting funding information. A good variation is to present a range of
funding amounts, along with the percentage chance of having each amount
available, plus the likely interest rate that the company will have to pay in order
to obtain the funds. By showing a probable interest rate, management will then
understand that extra tiers of funding will only be available at a greater cost, since
the company’s credit risk rises as it borrows more money. This form of presenta-
tion is an effective way to increase management’s understanding of funding
availability.

5-7 Identify Step-Costing Change Points

A typical problem for anyone constructing a budget is to determine when step-
costing points occur. A step-cost is a block of additional expenses that must be
added when a certain level of activity is reached. For example, machinery can only
operate at a reasonable capacity level, perhaps 75 percent, before another machine
must be added to cope with more work, even if that workload will only fill the
machine at a very low level of capacity. The same principle applies to adding
personnel or building space. In all cases, there is a considerable added expense that
must be incurred in one large block. If the expense is sufficiently large, it can play
havoc with the total level of expenses. Or, in the case of a really large capital
purchase, it may leave no room for other capital purchases for the next year.
Accordingly, it is necessary to keep close track of step-cost change points.

The best way to determine when an increase in step-costs will occur is to
create a table of activity measures that directly relates to each step-cost. For
example, a new shipping person is needed for every 135 pallets of product shipped
per day. By relating sales for the next year to the number of pallet loads of
shipments, one can reasonably predict when an additional shipper is needed.
Similarly, if a piece of production machinery will support $1 million of sales, it is
an easy matter to extrapolate this relationship based on expected sales to determine
when additional machine purchases must be made. However, keep in mind that
step-costs can be delayed by using new work methods, which can alter these
relationships. For example, an automated shrink-wrapping machine can substan-
tially increase the number of pallets that a single shipper can handle in a day, while
a good preventive maintenance routine can reduce the amount of machine
downtime, thereby increasing utilization rates and delaying the need for more
production equipment. When these changes are added to the budget, it becomes
necessary to change the relationship between the activity levels and step-costs,


5-9 Budget by Groups of Staff Positions 99

possibly with the relationships varying over the course of the budgeted period, as
more work methods are implemented.

Thus, identifying step-costing change points is necessary to understand when
new costs will be added to a budget, but you must also account for alterations in the
relationship between the underlying activity measures that cause the step-costs to
occur.

5-8 Budget for Attrition

One problem with budget models is trying to anticipate the number of employees
who will leave the company during the budget year, which is expressed as a
general reduction in the wage expense. One option is to budget for no departures,
which results in the maximum possible wage expense, and one that the budget
preparer knows in advance is unlikely to occur. Another possibility is to attempt to
predict exactly who is leaving, and when, which is subject to an extraordinary
degree of error.

An alternative approach is to incorporate into the budget an attrition percent-
age that is based on the company’s historical experience. This is the only
alternative that has some justifiable basis. It tends to be more accurate in larger
companies, since averages work better across several thousand employees than just
a few dozen or hundred. To derive a reasonable attrition percentage, review the
attrition for the past year and strip out those departures caused by onetime events,
such as the closure of a facility. Also, if the job market is tightening and the
company employs mostly skilled positions, then assume that the replacement
interval for positions will be longer, which results in a higher attrition percentage.

Since the timing of attrition is nearly impossible to predict, it is easier to apply
the same percentage across the entire year. It may be more inaccurate earlier in the
year, but the average level of attrition should move closer to the anticipated level
by the end of the year.

5-9 Budget by Groups of Staff Positions

The payroll portion of the budget model can be an excessively long one because
every person in the company is listed on it. In particular, many accountants have
difficulty avoiding a complete listing of all people who are not categorized as direct
labor. As a result, this portion of the budget becomes an unwieldy cluster of
information, requiring a long time to read, as well as a considerable amount of
updating work to keep track of everyone’s pay levels.


100 Budgeting Best Practices

A simple best practice is to summarize these positions by title, ensuring that
there are far fewer line items, so the budget becomes much easier to update and
review. To do so, summarize the pay levels of everyone with the same job title and
post the average pay rate in the model. For those people who object that they can no
longer determine who is summarized into which category, you can either issue a
separate list that identifies the title of each person in the company or else insert the
initials of all the people with each job title next to the summary-level description in
the budget (a difficult proposition when there are many people with the same title!).
The only real problem is in those companies where there is no record of the job
titles of employees. In this case, it may be sufficient to summarize all payroll for
each department into a single line item in the budget, with an average pay rate for
the entire group; this approach completely avoids the problem of determining pay
by title. Any of these variations will result in a simplified payroll section of the
budget, while still retaining a high degree of accuracy.

5-10 Create a Summarized Budget Model for Use
by Upper Management

The full budget model used by the accounting staff is a large one, with separate
pages for the balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, capital expenditures, and
each department, not to mention additional subsets of this information for each
subsidiary. The full budget for a small company should run about 20 pages, while
one for a multilocation corporation can easily run into the hundreds of pages. This
presents a problem for senior management when it wants to conduct what-if
analysis work with the budget. For example, the president of the company may
want to know what would happen to profits if there were | percent less direct labor,
or if materials costs changed due to an increase in inflation. Given the size of the
model, a senior manager’s only way to get this information is to request that a
budget analyst access the budget model, make the changes, and send the results
back. This can take days for one request to be completed, which is a problem when
the manager may want to model dozens of changes. Waiting for the results of all
possible variations on the manager’s requests may require months. During
the budget period, there is not enough time to process all of these requests, which
leads to delays in completing the budget and frustration on the part of senior
management.

The solution is to create a small, summarized version of the full budget model
for use by the senior management team. By doing so, these managers can play with
all possible what-if variations on the budget on their own computers, without
waiting for someone in the accounting department to process these changes for
them, saving a large amount of time. To create this model, you should interview
senior managers to see what kinds of variables they will want to alter. These will


5-11 Include a Working Capital Analysis 101

not vary much from year to year, unless there are drastic changes in the business, so
once the variables are identified, they can be listed in the front of the model for easy
access by the managers. For example, the variables can include the direct labor and
materials percentages, the inflation rate, average pay raise, average employee
benefit percentage, seasonality percentage for revenues, changes in revenues, and
the tax and interest rates. The remainder of the budget should be shrunken down to
the point where there is only a single expense line item for each department and the
smallest possible number of revenue line items. The goal should be to keep the
summarized budget model down to just a couple of pages. Also, to keep the data in
this model fresh, you can either give data a direct computer link to the main budget
model, automatically extracting the most current data from the real budget, or else
manually extract the information and retype it into the manager’s budget model
(which is a much easier proposition, and avoids any special programming).
Creating this model may take a few extra weeks but will be greatly appreciated
by senior management.

The only problem with this budget model is that senior managers may not
know how to use it or the computer on which it runs. If so, training is necessary,
which may be difficult to fit into a manager’s busy schedule. A good alternative is
to train each manager’s executive assistant, who can process any changes to the
budget model that the manager wishes to make.

5-11 Include a Working Capital Analysis

All too many companies have found that their budgets are entirely unworkable
because they have not accounted for the added cash required for working capital.
This is a particular problem for those organizations forecasting extremely high
rates of growth. They do not realize that they must have funds in advance to pay for
the staff and materials required to produce products, as well as to fund the
considerable increases in accounts receivable that will occur. Because of this, a
company finds that its sales take off, as per the budget, while cash reserves rapidly
dry up, resulting in a cash-starved organization that must scramble to find more
cash to keep it growing. More times than not, a promising start is hamstrung
because of lack of anticipation of working capital needs.

Clearly, the budget must account for working capital. There should be an extra
page devoted to it in the budget, or it can be included in the cash flow page. In
either case, the budget should make an assumption regarding the amount of
inventory, accounts payable, and accounts receivable that will occur as sales go up;
for example, there may be inventory turns of 12 per year, accounts receivable turns
of 9, and accounts payable turns of 10. These turnover figures must then be built
into the working capital formulas to determine how much extra cash will be needed
as sales increase. An alternative approach is to assume that all working capital


102 Budgeting Best Practices

changes will be cleared in one month; for example, accounts payable will be paid
in precisely one month, and accounts receivable paid by customers in the same
period. This simpler approach is the one most commonly found in budgets, though
it is not quite as accurate as the first method. The importance of accurate working
capital forecasting cannot be overstated, especially for a cash-strapped company.

5-12 Use Activity-Based Budgeting

For many organizations, the existing budgeting system simply does not yield
adequate results. Management can fiddle with the numbers all it wants, but
working within the existing structure of revenues by product line and expenses
by department is so rigid that there is little room for improving operating results.
Only by using outlandish assumptions, such as inordinate price increases or cost
reductions, can any reasonable profit improvement be attained. As the new budget
year progresses and everyone realizes that those absurd assumptions are not
attainable, some of the blame is put on the budgeting process, resulting in a loss of
credibility. This problem is especially common in old, established industries,
where competition is high and low profits are the norm.

Activity-based budgeting is the best solution for companies in this quandary. To
use it, the existing budget model must either be scrapped or used alongside a new
model, which pools all costs into cost centers, assigns these costs to activities, and
charges the activities to products and customers. By using this new approach, you
can see much more clearly the products on which a company really makes (or does
not make) money, and margins on all customers, based on the services they demand
from the company. With this better information, management can target cost
reductions in those areas where there is little return on the money invested, while
targeting expense increases if there is a corresponding increase in margin.

The biggest problem with activity-based budgeting is that it requires an entirely
new budget model, as well as a new chart of accounts in which to store the budget
information. Both of these changes are significant and require months (and some-
times years) of careful planning and implementation. The reason for all the planning
is that all accounting information systems are designed to feed information into the
existing chart of accounts, so these systems must be modified to accumulate data in
the manner required for the activity-based budgeting system instead. One way
around this problem is to keep the old budgeting model and continue to account for it
through the chart of accounts in the traditional manner, manually maintaining the
new budgeting model to one side and reporting on actual results with a separate
system. Though certainly more labor intensive, this approach can be implemented at
once and requires very little change in the existing accounting systems.

5-14 Link a Bonus Sliding Scale to the Budget 103

5-13 Incorporate Target Costing into the Budgeting Process

Target costing is the process of setting a target cost for a new product design and
requiring the product design team to either meet the cost target or abandon the
project if it cannot do so. The accounting department’s sole involvement in this
process is typically the inclusion of a cost accountant on the design team who
monitors the team’s ongoing progress in meeting its cost goals.

The problem with this level of accounting involvement is that there is no
linkage to the corporate budgeting process, so there is likely to be a reduced level
of budgeting accuracy for the cost of goods sold. To improve the situation, require
the participating cost accountants to forward status reports to the budgeting staff
for the current status of all product design projects for which target costing is used.
This has the following positive impacts on the budgeting process:

¢ The preliminary budget can be adjusted continually to reflect the go or no-go
status of each design project. Thus, if the decision is made to eliminate a
prospective product, its related revenues and costs can be immediately
removed from the budget model.

¢ The budgeted cost of goods sold for each product can be adjusted to match the
estimated final cost of each new product design.

To incorporate this target costing information into the budgeting process, the
budget model must already itemize revenues and costs at the individual product
level. However, if the current budget model only aggregates revenues and costs at
the product line level, you can at least incorporate into the model (in percentage
terms) the general impact expected from a target costing program.

5-14 Linka Bonus Sliding Scale to the Budget

A reasonably progressive budgeting model will include a direct link into the
corporate bonus plan, with staff being paid bonuses based on their achievement of
certain goals. Although the intention is good—to create incentives to achieve the
budget—it actually tends to create more problems than it solves.

One problem is that if employees realize that they will fall short of their bonus
targets, they will be more likely to hoard their resources or possible sales for the
next period, when they will have a better opportunity to achieve better performance
and be paid a bonus. The result is wild swings in corporate performance from
period to period as employees cycle through the hoard-to-splurge cycle.

Another problem is that if the bonus target cannot be attained by normal
means, employees will stretch or break the accounting rules in a variety of ways to
achieve the target. By doing so, a low level of ethics is introduced into the


104 Budgeting Best Practices

company, while also likely saddling the company with a variety of accounting
problems that must be addressed in future periods.

The solution is to link the budget to a sliding performance scale that contains
no “hard” performance goals. The best example of the sliding bonus scale is what it
is not—there are no specific goals at which the bonus target suddenly increases in
size. Instead, the bonus is a constant percentage of the goal, such as | percent of
sales or 5 percent of net after-tax profits. Also, there should be no upper boundary
to the sliding scale, which would present employees with the disincentive to stop
performing once they have reached a maximum bonus level. Similarly, there
should theoretically be no lower limit to the bonus either, though it is more
common to see a baseline level that is derived from the corporate breakeven point,
on the grounds that employees must at least ensure that the company does not lose
money. The sliding-scale approach also makes it much easier to budget for the
bonus expense at various activity levels, rather than trying to budget for the more
common all-or-nothing bonus payment.

5-15 Use Flex Budgeting

Perhaps the single most tedious part of updating a budget is altering the myriad
expense line items every time someone makes a change to the estimated revenue
level. Revenue is far and away the most commonly tweaked number in a budget, so
the underlying expenses have to be recast to be in proportion to the changed
revenue levels a multitude of times. This is a major chore not only for the
accounting staff maintaining the budget but also for those managers who must be
contacted about changes to the expense levels they had previously authorized.

A recasting of the budget model will largely eliminate this problem. Instead
of making changes to the expense line item for every expense in the budget, it is
much easier to set up each one as either a flexible expense account or one that is
fixed within a broad range of revenue levels. If it is fixed, there is no need for
change, unless there is an enormous alteration in budgeted revenue levels.
However, many other expenses will vary directly with revenue; in these cases, it
is possible to revise the budget formulas so that they are listed as percentages of
the monthly revenue level. By making these formula alterations, it becomes an
easy matter to adjust revenue and see a swath of expense changes ripple through
the budget model—with no manual intervention whatsoever. This best practice
can reduce budget maintenance work to a fraction of the amount formerly
needed.

Though the flex budget discussion has centered on tying expenses to specific
revenue levels, it is also possible, and probably more accurate, to tie some expenses
to other levels of activity. For example, telephone usage or office expenses should
be linked more properly to the number of budgeted employees, while utility costs

can be tied either to square footage used or the number of machines in operation.
Thus, you can link expenses to a number of activity measures in a flex budget.

Cost: SF Installation time:

5-16 Incorporate Risk Analysis into Budget Modeling

Most budgets include only a single scenario, where a single mix of assumptions
culminate in a single estimate of revenue and expenses. Examples of key
assumptions are the inflation rate, the price of energy, the impact of a lawsuit,
and the entry into the market of a low-priced competitor. Usually, these assump-
tions are based on what actually happened during the preceding year.
Unfortunately, reality can diverge sharply from an assumption, resulting in an
extremely inaccurate budget model.

Though it is impossible to predetermine every possible variation in assump-
tions, the budget model can at least be structured so that a wide range of
assumption values can be entered into it, to see what impact they will have on
the company’s financial results. This type of risk analysis calls for the use of a flex
budget, as described in a preceding best practice, since a flex budget will
automatically change many of its numerical values as a result of a change in
an assumption.

To the extent possible, try to cluster all assumptions on a single page of the
budget model, where they will be more readily accessible for modeling and
viewing activities. Once all risk analysis has been conducted with the budget
model, include the results of this experimentation in a separate budget report, and
forward it to the management team for review. Managers can use it to determine
whether further action is needed to mitigate the impact of changes in certain
assumptions.

5-17 Automatically Link the Budget to Purchase Orders

A budget is not of much use if it is not tightly linked to company operations. It is
common for a company to spend an inordinate amount of time constructing a fine
budget and then struggle with how to force the company to live by it. When this
happens, the people who participated in creating the budget wonder why they spent
time on it and will certainly be less willing to do so in the future. In this instance,
the budget is seen as a mere formality.

To avoid the problem, link the budget to purchase orders. Under this method,

for this item to the budgeted amount and either issues a warning for an overbudget
expenditure or rejects it. By using this best practice, you can be assured of keeping
expenditures within budgeted levels.

However, there are some issues to deal with when using this system. One is that
there may be necessary reasons for making an expenditure, such as an emergency
purchase of some kind that must be made in order to keep the facility running. In this
case, it may be useful to allow a manager to override the system with a special
password. Also, some managers may be caught unawares toward the end of the
year—if they have spent an inordinate amount earlier in the year, they will have no
funding available at all for the last few weeks or months of the year. In this situation, it
is best to forewarn managers over the course of the year by issuing a simple report,
such as the one shown in Exhibit 5.3, that lists each expense item, the year-to-date
amount spent, the full-year budget, and the amount left to spend. This information
allows managers to know the exact amount available for their use and generally
avoids the problem of people running out of money at the end of the year.

5-18 Issue a Budget Procedure and Timetable

The typical budget dies a lingering death. It is not issued on time, nor is the first
issuance likely to be the last one. Instead, there are a multitude of last-minute
changes that force the budget process to continue into the next year. As a result, the


5-18 Issue a Budget Procedure and Timetable 107

budget may not be usable as a basis of comparison for new year results for several
months.

The best solution is to issue a tightly structured budget procedure to the
organization, along with an accompanying timetable, that specifies when all
activities will occur, who will complete them, and when a deliverable is due
back at the budget manager’s office. By laying out the process in this manner and
following up closely on all due dates, it is possible to issue a complete budget on
time, every time. A good budget procedure should include the following steps, at a
minimum:

¢ Benchmarking comparison. Though rarely used in a budget, it is extremely
useful to conduct a benchmarking comparison of corporate performance
against those of “best-in-class” companies, and to provide this information
with the budget packages that go out to all departments so that they can set
expectations for improvements in their areas. This task can be completed well
in advance of the regular budget process.

¢ Revenue budget. The first part of the budget process is always a determina-
tion by the sales staff of what they think they can sell in the upcoming year.
Without this information, the remainder of the budget is impossible to
construct. This portion must be completed and returned before any other
steps can be completed.

¢ Materials budget. The purchasing department uses the revenue budget to
determine its purchasing volumes, which is necessary for forecasting materi-
als costs based on purchase volumes.

¢ Automation budget. The industrial engineering staff must determine what
automation it plans to add to the production floor in order to eliminate direct
labor and improve efficiencies. The timing of when these changes will be
completed has a major impact on when to budget changes in labor and
efficiencies into the forthcoming budget.

¢ Personnel budget. There must be a separate budget that outlines all the staff
positions needed, their average pay rates, and the associated payroll burden.
This number will vary based on the revenue volumes that were previously
determined, not to mention any automation projects.

¢ Capital budget. The automation budget will feed into the capital budget,
since these projects usually require a considerable amount of funding. There
may be other capital projects that do not run through the engineering
department, such as for office equipment, so this budget is not normally
completed until all departments have submitted their budgets.

¢ Departmental budget. Each department must note its expected expenditures,
as well as personnel requirements.

¢ Cash flow budget. After all the previous budgets are returned, the accounting
staff loads them into the budget model, which determines any resulting profits


108 Budgeting Best Practices

or losses, working capital changes, and capital requirements, all of which feed
into the cash flow budget.

¢ Funding and investments budget. The cash flow budget feeds into the
funding and investments budget. This one is used by the chief financial officer,
who determines either the sources and cost of funds (if cash is needed) or
where it is to be invested and the expected returns from doing so (if there will
be a cash surplus). The results of this budget will also feed back into the
interest expense and investment income line items elsewhere in the budget.

¢ Employee performance budget. Finally, after the budget is completed, the
human resources manager uses it to create an employee performance budget
that links pay levels and bonus payments to the performance levels noted
elsewhere in the budget, such as completing automation projects or attaining
budgeted sales levels.

Also, some companies may want to include an acquisitions budget, which is
closely linked to the funding and investments budget, since this activity will have a
major impact on cash flows.

The preceding list of budget modules makes it obvious that the budget process
flows in a very specific sequence, with one part of the budget being used as a basis
for the next part. The budget procedure and timetable must be built around this
budget flow; specific dates of completion for one piece of the budget tie into the
start date of the next part of the budget that requires information from the first part.
It is wise to include a buffer of a few days between the completion date of one part
and the start of the next so that inevitable completion troubles can still be ironed
out, leaving sufficient time to complete the overall budget by the targeted date. Do
not be surprised if the timetable is not accurate in the first year it is used, since it is
difficult to estimate completion times. Just be sure to note actual completion dates
in the first year and adjust the timetable accordingly in the following year. Only by
constant adjustment over a long period of time will the budget procedure and
timetable become fine-tuned tools for the efficient and orderly completion of the
budget.

5-19 Preload Budget Line Items

The traditional way to create budgets at the department level is to send each
department manager a copy of the year-to-date department financials, and a blank
budget form for the next year, with a detailed procedure for how to fill out the
budget form for every line item in the department’s budget. By doing so,
department managers are taken away from their operational duties for an extended
period of time, while they read through the procedure and make a series of


5-20 Adopt Two-Stage Capital Budgeting 109

educated guesses about what their revenues and expenses will be for the upcoming
year. The considerable amount of time taken up by budgeting activities is one of
the main reasons why the budgeting cycle is roundly detested by many managers.

This level of aversion can be mitigated by having the accounting staff preload
many of the budget line items. Most expenses are relatively fixed from year to year,
or are easily linked to key drivers, such as head count. Consequently, the
accounting staff can probably arrive at more accurate budget numbers than a
department manager for most line items. This approach leaves only a few of the
larger and more variable accounts for managers to enter in the budget form. In
some cases where a department is anticipating no major changes for the next
budget year, it may even be possible for the accounting staff to create the entire
department budget, so the department manager only has to make revisions to it.
However, total preloading tends to shift responsibility (and blame) from the
department managers to the accounting department, and so should only be
used with caution.

Procedurally, the accounting staff should negotiate with each manager the
number of budget line items they are to fill out, and the basis upon which they are to
arrive at their numbers. The basis used could be the previous year’s numbers
multiplied by the current inflation rate, or a set dollar amount per department
employee. Once this agreement is set up, it can usually be rolled forward over
multiple years with little subsequent change.

5-20 Adopt Two-Stage Capital Budgeting

The average operations manager does not have a degree in finance, and does not
want one. And yet, part of the capital budgeting process requires them to fill out a
funds application that requires justification based on such discounted cash flow
models as net present value or an internal rate of return, as well as cash flow
modeling during each year of the proposed project. The typical manager will
require a great deal of time to complete this application, and there is a significant
risk that it will not be completed correctly, given the low expertise level of the user.

A better approach is to split the capital budgeting procedure in two—only
expensive capital requests are still required to follow a comprehensive application
process, while lower-cost ones can follow a simplified application process that is
easier for managers to complete. The more comprehensive approach will still be
needed for the 20 percent of capital requests that require about 80 percent of all
funding, leaving the simplified approach for all remaining requests, which should
be about four out of every five requests.

A simplified capital request should not require a discounted cash flow
analysis; a simplified matrix showing when cash expenditures are anticipated
should form the core of the financial analysis. Also, those managers still required to


110 Budgeting Best Practices

wade through the more comprehensive application form should receive some
help—the accounting manager can assign a budgeting specialist to each manager
who is filling out this form and assist the manager with the creation of a discounted
cash modeling part of the application. This assistant can also review the application
for mistakes, which will reduce the number of iterations to which the application is
likely to be subjected.

5-21 Purchase Budgeting and Planning Software

The vast majority of businesses create and maintain their budgets using an
electronic spreadsheet such as Excel. Though this approach works fine for small
organizations, it is quite unwieldy for large ones. The trouble is that individual
departments create their own budget models using formats that vary from the one
used by the budgeting department. When the budgeting staff receives these models
from the various departments, they must manually reinput the information into a
master spreadsheet, which is quite labor intensive. Also, when any significant
variable is added to the model, all related formulas must be manually altered and
then tested to ensure that the model still operates properly. Further, it is difficult to
track which department has submitted budget information or when it made its last
update. For these reasons, larger companies have considerable difficulty using
spreadsheets as the basis for a budgeting system.

The solution is to purchase budgeting and planning (B&P) software. This
software maintains a central database of budgeting information that is automati-
cally updated when users enter information. The software can also be maintained
off-site by an application service provider (ASP). In addition, the software
generates templates for data-entry use by each department, as well as issuing
all pro forma financial reports at the press of a button. The better systems also have
workflow management capabilities that reveal who has not yet submitted a budget.
Variance analysis tools issue warnings to the budgeting staff when submitted
budgeting information exceeds predetermined levels or when other preset rules are
violated. A variety of other capabilities are available, such as automatically
calculating line-of-credit projections, designing what-if scenarios, determining
inventory requirements based on sales and turnover levels, and conducting ratio
analysis.

These are complex software systems that require customized installation, so
expect to pay more than $100,000 for the larger systems. A pay-as-you-go ASP
solution will be significantly less expensive in the short term, and may be a better
solution if a company wants to see how the system works before investing in an in-
house installation.

A more advanced version of budgeting and planning software is called
business performance management (BPM) software. A BPM system is usually


5-23 Revise Budgets on a Quarterly Basis 111

layered on top of a company’s data warehouse and is useful for measuring the
performance of an entire organization, and then connecting the analysis to budgets
and forecasts. Though separate software packages are available for both budgeting
and performance measurement, the BPM systems are capable of seamlessly
connecting the two areas, resulting in less software maintenance and the elimi-
nation of data inconsistencies among multiple systems.

5-22 Reduce the Number of Accounts

Some budget models are astoundingly complex because there are so many account
line items in which to record budgeting information. This is nearly always the fault
of the controller, who has allowed the chart of accounts to grow to an excessive
degree. Once there are too many accounts in the general ledger, it becomes
obligatory to budget for the contents of each one. This presents the dual problems
of adding new lines to the budget every year, and of forcing managers to do extra
analysis to determine the budgeted amounts for the upcoming year.

The solution is to eliminate as many accounts as possible from the chart of
accounts. This takes a long time, since you must be careful to shift account
balances to surviving accounts, verify that inactivated accounts are not used for
some special purpose, and confirm that there will be no impact on the resulting
financial reports. Given the intricacies of eliminating accounts, it is usually best to
do so in small groups of just a few per month, with an overall reduction in the
number of accounts taking as long as a year to complete. Once this is done, it is a
simple matter to eliminate the same accounts from the budget.

Another approach that is not only quicker but also bypasses the need for a
lengthy reduction in the chart of accounts, is to eliminate the accounts in the budget
model, but to keep them in the actual chart of accounts. This option will result in no
budget in the upcoming budget period for those accounts that have been excluded
from the budget model, so it is only useful for those accounts with very small
balances. Thus, this is only good for a few accounts and is not as definitive a
solution as eliminating accounts from the chart of accounts for good.

5-23 Revise Budgets on a Quarterly Basis

Most organizations create new budgets just once a year. By doing so, they make
estimates of sales volume for a number of months into the future that are extremely
difficult to meet, and then build a “house of cards” of projected expenses and
capital purchases that are justified by these weak sales numbers. Because of the


112 Budgeting Best Practices

difficulty of estimating sales, managers tend to err on the conservative side,
estimating revenues that are too low. Furthermore, when the budget year has been
completed, the management team tends to waste time arguing about why actual
performance did not meet the expectations set within the budget. Finally, any
unexpected changes in the business during the year, such as an acquisition or the
elimination of a product, will not be included in the budget, so all budget-versus-
actual analyses will be off by the amount of these changes, rendering the analyses
worthless.

You can incrementally revise budgets on a quarterly or even a monthly basis
in order to avoid these problems. By doing so, all key revenue and related expense
or capital decisions can be revised to reflect short-term changes in the business,
making the budget a much more relevant document.

The difficulty with this best practice is the greatly increased number of
required budgeting iterations. Since this is generally considered to be a difficult
process to complete just once a year, imagine the consternation of management if
the process is done again every three months! To reduce the pain of this process,
consider shifting away from the use of electronic spreadsheets for budgeting
calculations, instead using commercially sold budgeting packages that allow for
direct updating of budget information in the model, while also allowing for easy
changes to the budget model without the attendant calculation errors that are so
common in an electronic spreadsheet. By making this change, budgeting iterations
are much easier to complete.

5-24 Simplify the Budget Model

Accompany that has used the same budgeting model for many years will find that it
gradually becomes more complicated. This is because there are incremental
changes each year—a new analysis page here, extra departments there, perhaps
some assumptions as well. Though the changes seem minimal if looked at for just
one year, the accumulation over many years makes the model very cumbersome,
difficult to understand, and prone to error. For example, if formulas are added to the
budget that require inputting the final balance sheet numbers from the previous
year, it is possible that no one will remember this when the next budgeting cycle
arrives in the following year, especially if the person who made the change in the
previous year is no longer with the company, or if the change was not documented
anywhere. As the number of these changes pile up over the years, it becomes
increasingly difficult to complete the budget on time. The person managing the
budget model becomes increasingly indispensable, for no one else knows how to
use it.

To avoid these problems, it is necessary to regularly simplify the budget
model. This does not mean that the simplification can be done once and then

dropped. On the contrary, the standard budget procedure should begin with a
review of the model from the previous year to ensure that all budget line items and
calculations are thoroughly documented and understandable and that they are still
needed. There should also be a step that specifically requires the budget manager to
review the need for extra line items and formulas, with an eye to eliminating as
much as possible from the budget model every year. Though it may not be possible
to completely streamline the budget model in one year, a continuing effort in this
area will yield excellent results as long as the review is continual.

An added benefit of simplifying the budget model is that less budgetary
“gaming” arises. For example, when a large number of expense categories are
used, managers tend to resort to all kinds of expense juggling as the budget year
progresses in order to ensure that actual expenses incurred exactly match the
amounts budgeted. These games are a waste of corporate resources, since they take
management time away from the corporate mission. By summarizing many
revenue and expense line items into just a few budgetary line items, managers
will have the leeway to run the business in response to ongoing developments in
the marketplace, rather than in accordance with the dictates of the budget.

Though the main focus of this best practice is to reduce the complexity of
the budget model, it is sometimes sufficient to ensure that the model is
adequately documented. Some businesses really become more complex over
time and therefore require more detailed budget models. This is particularly true
of companies on a fast growth track, especially if they are growing by acquisition
and must account for the operations of many new businesses. In these cases, the
budget manager should review the model at the end of each budget cycle to see
what has been added to the model this year, and verify that complete and
thoroughly understandable descriptions have been included in the budget
procedure that note the reasons for the changes, how they work, and the
resulting impact on the entire budget model. This step may be all that is needed
for some companies.

5-25 Use Online Budget Updating

One of the most difficult problems for a budget manager in a large company is
bringing together the budget information arriving from a multitude of outlying
company locations. For example, a location may send budget updates on paper or a
compact disc, either of which requires the manual translation of this information
into the budget model by the budget manager’s staff. If there are many locations
reporting budget information, this can result in a flood of work for several days.
Also, the person reentering the budget information may make a typing error,
thereby altering a budgeted amount from what a subsidiary intended, or may
misconstrue the submitted data and list a budget number in the wrong account.

In either case, the budget must be reviewed by the subsidiary and a request made to
adjust the error, which takes still more time and effort.

An excellent best practice that entirely eliminates this problem is to give
subsidiaries direct online access to the budget model. They can then enter it
themselves, make any necessary changes, and review the results. By doing so, all
errors are made, and must be corrected, by the subsidiaries, taking this chore away
from the central accounting group.

A problem with this best practice is that anyone from any subsidiary can now
have access to the entire budget model, with the ability to delete it, alter
information for other parts of the company, or just observe the numbers budgeted
for other divisions or departments, which can be confidential. To avoid this
problem, it may be necessary to split the budget into different files, one for each
subsidiary, and then give password access only to the portion of the budget
assigned to each subsidiary. Another option is to keep the budget model in one
piece but to restrict access by passwords to just those account codes that apply to
each subsidiary. The first option allows a company to use an electronic spreadsheet
to contain the model, but the latter approach requires that it be stored in a database
with better password protection than is typically available for an electronic
spreadsheet. A company can pick either option based on its overall need for
securing budget information.

5-26 Operate without a Budget

Thus far, we have suggested a number of budgeting improvements on the
assumption that a budget will, in fact, be used. However, there are a number
of fundamental problems with the concept of budgeting. For example, creating a
fixed budget for the next year tends to tie a business into the expectations that were
formed along with the budget; if the market changes during the budget year,
employees may not react to the market changes, preferring instead to “make their
numbers.” Also, managers whose performance will be based on their ability to
attain budgeted results will probably attempt to influence the budget by estimating
excessively low revenues and excessively high expenses. This means that the
budget does not present overly difficult performance targets. Further, senior
managers may attempt to impose a draconian command and control management
structure on a business, under which bonuses are paid based on the ability to attain
budgeted numbers; the result is minimal reliance on local initiative to improve
operations. In short, some organizations have found that a budget is not a good
management tool.

The alternative is to operate without a budget. In order to give a no-budget
company some planning structure, a budget must be replaced with something else,
which is:


116 Budgeting Best Practices

¢ Rolling forecast. A high-level rolling forecast should be updated at approxi-
mately one-month intervals. The intent is not to base performance bonuses on
this forecast, but rather to use it as a short-range planning tool.

¢ Compensation planning. Rather than linking compensation to a budget,
there should be a single performance-based compensation plan for the entire
company, which is calculated relative to the performance levels of competitors
or some other benchmark.

¢ Capital allocations. Funds for fixed-asset purchases are made available
whenever needed, rather than during the annual budgeting period. The
purchasing review process should be just a rigorous as would be used in a
standard budgeting system.

Summary

This chapter focused primarily on those best practices that improve a budget
model’s ease of use as well as the quality of the information it produces. These are
the very issues most managers complain about, since many budget models take an
eternity to produce and are not that accurate when released. Since the bulk of the
changes in this area are easy and inexpensive to implement, there is no reason that
an active and enterprising accounting manager cannot swiftly replace the old
budgeting system with one that is easy to use and results in excellent budgeting
information.

There was a lesser focus on best practices that enhance your use of the budget
once it has been produced. Since the budget is an excellent control tool, the best of
these practices is one that ties the budget directly to the purchase order system so
that purchase orders can be automatically compared to the remaining available
budget and rejected by the computer if there are no budgeted funds remaining.
Another best practice links a bonus sliding scale to the budget, while another
creates a summarized budget model for further financial modeling work by
members of management. These are effective ways to maximize the budget
once it has been produced.

Cash Management
Best Practices

This chapter covers the best practices that can be used to create a more efficient
cash management function. Though this area falls into the finance function at many
larger companies, it is typically under the authority of the controller in a smaller
company, and so is covered in this book.

The best practices in this chapter are primarily concerned with creating an
orderly flow of cash into and out of a company’s coffers, leaving no cash in the
system that is not being properly utilized to the fullest extent. This method frees up
the largest possible amount for investment purposes. The vast majority of these
best practices are complementary, working most effectively if they are all used at
once.

This chapter begins with a discussion of the implementation problems
associated with each best practice and then moves on to cover the advantages
and disadvantages of using each one.

Implementation Issues for Cash Management Best Practices

All of the best practices covered in this chapter are noted in Exhibit 6.1, which
shows the cost and duration of each item. In nearly all cases, cash management
implementations are quite inexpensive and can be completed in a short time. The
reason for these easy setups is that there is no custom programming involved, and
no need to involve other departments. Without these two problem areas, it becomes
an easy matter to install a whole range of best practices in short order. To make the
situation even easier, a company’s bank is usually eager to help install most of
these items, because they involve creating close banking ties, which keeps a
company from moving its banking business elsewhere. A bank can also charge

fees for many of these services, which gives it an added incentive to help out. Thus,
cash management is an area in which a controller can enjoy great success in
improving operations.

Though all of the best practices noted in Exhibit 6.1 are covered in some detail
later in this chapter, it is useful to see how the most important ones fit together into
a coherent set of cash management practices. Accordingly, there is a flowchart in
Exhibit 6.2 that shows how lockboxes and cash sweeping can be used to
accumulate cash from customers and forward it into a central bank account,
from which cash is distributed only as needed to a payroll zero-balance account
(for payments to employees) and a controlled disbursements account (for pay-
ments to suppliers). By using this approach, cash can be quickly sent to the main
bank account and doled out only when company checks are cashed, which allows
the cash management staff to transfer all remaining funds to an investment account
where it can earn interest, rather than lying idle in any number of corporate
checking accounts.

savings, or checking account, the most common way to find out is to call the

company’s bank representative. This is a slow and sometimes inaccurate approach,
since the representative may not be available or will misread the information
appearing on the screen.

An easier approach is to provide bank customers with direct access to their
account information through a web site. This access is free, requires no special
software besides an Internet browser. The more advanced sites allow users to
download check images, initiate wire transfers, and move funds between accounts.

When conducting online bank reconciliations, it is best to do so on a daily
basis. There are three reasons for using a daily reconciliation. First, it improves
your knowledge of the current cash position. Second, there is little reconciliation
work remaining at month end, which contributes to a faster close. Finally, a daily
review will uncover control problems more quickly, possibly leading to reduced
fraud.


120 Cash Management Best Practices

There are a few procedural issues to be aware of when conducting daily bank
reconciliations:

¢ High transaction volume. If there are many daily transactions to cross-
check, it is easy to miss one. If so, either reconcile in clusters by type of
transaction (deposits first, checks second, etc.) or print the bank’s daily
transactions and manually cross off each one as it is reconciled.

¢ Missed days. It is easy to forget to reconcile every day. To avoid this
problem, list it in the daily work log to be the first item handled each day, so it
is completed before other issues arise and force it into the background. Also,
always verify that the accounting records were reconciled for the previous day
when conducting the current day’s reconciliation.

¢ Record electronic transactions on weekends. If batches of check deposits
and incoming Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments are recorded as
received in the company’s accounting records on the same day, this presents a
problem for the person completing a daily bank reconciliation. An ACH
payment will clear the bank at once, whereas a check payment may not clear
for several days, making it difficult to check off all receipts for that day as
being received. To avoid this problem, record electronic receipts on weekend
dates, when there are no check receipts to muddy the reconciliation process.

Cost: Sy Installation time:

6-2 Automatically Apply Cash

Even a well-run accounting department cannot be expected to apply incoming cash
to outstanding receivables in less than one day, using traditional methods. The time
required to manually match checks against open receivables, with the attendant
problems of incorrect application and deduction management, is simply too great
to allow for any notable improvements in process time. A good way out of this trap
is to avoid it entirely by automating the bulk of all cash applications. When fully
implemented, an automatic cash application system (sometimes known as
AutoCash) can apply more than 90 percent of all cash receipts. This also results
in lower days sales outstanding and provides a clear audit trail that may be useful
for a Sarbanes-Oxley controls review.

The usual beginning point for an automated cash application is the lockbox.
The lockbox operator records the magnetic ink character recognition (MICR)
number and total payment amount from each received check, rather than the full
remittance detail, and consolidates this information into an electronic feed that is
sent directly into the company’s accounting system. When performed manually,
the lockbox data-entry cost per check is usually in the range of 15 to 30 cents.

The company’s computer system uses the customer’s bank account number
(which is located within the MICR number) to match the check payment to the


6-3 Avoid Delays in Check Posting 121

correct customer. The system then uses cash application rules to determine which
invoices are being paid. Examples of these rules are:

1. Only apply the check to an invoice if the check exactly matches the amount
of a single invoice. This is the most simplistic rule, and will result in the
majority of all checks being kicked out for manual application.

2. Apply the check to multiple invoices that exactly match the check amount. To
avoid excessive computer processing time to calculate all possible invoice
combinations, this algorithm is usually restricted to just those invoices coming
due for payment within the next few days, or those that are already overdue.

3. In addition to either of the first two options, match against the total shown on
the most recent account statement sent to each customer.

4. In addition to any of the first three options, include an allowance for such
deductions as freight or advertising allowances, which can be set by amount
or percentage of invoice by individual customer.

Automatic cash application does not work with certain customers who
continually take outsized deductions or refuse to pay freight charges or sales
taxes. In these cases, it is best to flag the customers’ payments for immediate
manual application. By doing so, the cash misapplication rate can be greatly
reduced, though the overall cash application rate will also decline.

The AutoCash system must also determine whether there is a possibility of a
duplicate match, where the payment could match any one of several invoices or
invoice combinations. Duplicate matches are usually kicked out for manual
application.

The overall cash application rate will gradually improve over time, as the user
matches more MICR codes to customers, determines how to handle different types
of deductions, and incorporates the payment patterns of customers into its system.

6-3 Avoid Delays in Check Posting

When there is a sudden influx of checks, the accounting staff may require an extra
day to post them all against the accounts receivable database. This delay can also
occur when the payments being made are slightly different from the invoices that
they are paying, which requires some delay while the differences are reconciled.
Though these problems can create a real bottleneck in the accounting department,
they also result in a lengthening of the time interval before the checks are deposited
at the bank, which in turn results in lost investment income.

To avoid this problem, the accounting staff can photocopy checks as they
arrive so that postings can be done from the copies, rather than the original checks.


122 Cash Management Best Practices

This allows the deposit to be made at once, rather than later. The main problem is
the danger that a check will not be copied or that the copy will be lost, which results
in a missed posting to the accounts receivable database. This problem leads to
downstream collections and research problems involving backtracking to find the
missing checks, thought it can be avoided through proper reconciliation proce-
dures that match the total number of copied checks to the total number of actual
checks, as well as the total amount posted to the total amount on the copied checks.

6-4 Require Mailings to Mailstop Number

Ina well-organized mailroom, incoming letters are opened, sorted by recipient, and
then distributed throughout the company in an orderly manner. This is not optimal
from a cash flow perspective, since mail processing can add multiple hours to the
cash receiving process, which in turn can delay cash deposits at the bank until the
following day.

To reduce the duration of this delay, consider having all customers remit their
payments to a specific mailstop number, which they include in the mailing address on
their payments. When the mailroom staff sees this mailstop number, they immedi-
ately forward the payments to the accounting department, rather than including them
in the normal letter distribution process. This process acceleration can result in faster
check deposits, which in turn increases the amount of interest income earned.

The problem with this best practice is that it sidesteps a standard cash control,
which is to have the mailroom staff create an itemized list of checks received,
which is later compared to the amounts recorded in the accounting records by the
cashier. This control can be transferred to the person in the accounting department
who receives the checks from the mailroom staff; this person can itemize the
checks and then forward them to the cashier for recordation.

Cost: Sy Installation time:

6-5 Collect Receivables through Lockboxes

There are a number of problems associated with receiving all customer payments at a
company location. For example, checks can be lost or delayed in the mailroom, given
to the wrong accounting person for further processing, or delayed in transit from the
company to the bank. It is also necessary for the mailroom staff to log in all received
checks, which are later compared to the deposit slip sent out by the accounting staff to
ensure that all received checks have been deposited—this is a non-value-added step,
though it is necessary to provide some control over received checks. All these steps
are needed if checks are received and processed directly by a company.


6-5 Collect Receivables through Lockboxes 123

The answer is to have the bank receive the checks instead. To do so, a
company’s bank sets up a lockbox, which is essentially a separate mailbox to
which deposits are sent by customers. The bank opens all mail arriving at the
lockbox, deposits all checks at once, copies them, and forwards the copies and
anything else contained in customer remittances to the company. This approach
has the advantage of accelerating the flow of cash into a company’s bank account,
since the lockbox system typically reduces the mail float customers enjoy by at
least a day, while also eliminating all of the transaction-processing time that a
company would also need during its internal cash-processing steps. The system
can be enhanced further by creating lockboxes at a number of locations throughout
the country, with locations very close to a company’s largest customers. Customers
send their funds to the nearest lockbox, which further reduces the mail float and
increases the speed with which funds arrive in a company’s coffers. If there are
multiple lockboxes, a company should periodically compare the locations of its
lockboxes to those of its customers, to ensure that the constantly changing mix of
customers does not call for an alteration in the locations of some lockboxes to bring
the overall mail float time down to the lowest possible level. In short, there are
some exceptional advantages to using lockboxes.

There are two problems with lockboxes. First, a bank will charge both a fixed
and variable-rate fee for the use of a lockbox. There is a small, fixed monthly fee
for the lockbox, plus a charge of a few cents for every processed check. For a
company with a very small number of incoming checks, these costs may make it
uneconomical to maintain a lockbox. Second, the work required to convince
customers to change the company’s pay-to address can be considerable. Every
customer must be contacted, usually by mail, to inform them of the new lockbox
address to which they must now send their payments. If they do not comply (a
common occurrence), someone must make a reminder call. If there are many
customers, this can be a major task to complete and may not be worthwhile if the
sales to each customer are extremely small—the cost of contacting them may
exceed the profit from annual sales to them. Thus, a company with a small number
of customers or many low-volume customers may not find it cost effective to use a
lockbox.

An additional issue is the number of lockboxes to be used. A company cannot
maintain an infinite number of them, since each one has a fixed cost that can add
up. Instead, a common approach is to periodically hire a consultant, sometimes
provided by a bank, who analyzes the locations and average sales to all customers,
calculates the average mail float for each one, and offsets this information with the
cost of putting lockboxes in specific locations. The result is a cost-benefit
calculation that trades off excessive mail float against the cost of additional
lockboxes to arrive at the most profitable mix of lockbox locations.

A final issue is that some customers will ignore all lockbox addresses and
continue to send their checks directly to a company. When this happens, the
controller can either process the checks as usual, using all the traditional control
points, or simply have the mailroom staff put all the checks into an envelope and


124 Cash Management Best Practices

mail them to the lockbox. The latter approach is frequently the best because it
allows a company to completely avoid all cash deposit procedures. The only case
where the traditional cash-processing approach may still have to be followed is
when a company is in extreme need of cash and can deposit the funds more quickly
by walking them to the nearest bank branch to deposit immediately. Otherwise, all
checks should be routed through the lockbox.

Consequently, one or more lockboxes can be a highly effective way to avoid
the cumbersome check deposit procedure, while also accelerating the speed of
incoming cash flows. In only a minority of situations will a lockbox not be a cost-
effective alternative.

6-6 Install Remote Deposit Capture

Ifa company does not use a lockbox to accelerate its cash flow from check receipts,
then it must physically transfer all checks from the accounting department to the
local bank. If the person normally assigned to handle this task is not available, or if
the department is too short-staffed to spare a person, then the company misses an
extra day before the checks are deposited. If the bank is located relatively far away,
then depositing also wastes a fair amount of time by the person assigned to make
the deposit.

A much better alternative is to install a remote deposit capture system on-site.
This involves scanning all checks through a scanner that is linked to a computer,
and then sending the scanned check images over the Internet to the bank. This
avoids all of the time that would normally be spent walking the checks over to the
bank, and so pays for the monthly scanner rental fee just with the saved staff time.
The process also results in a slight reduction in check-clearing time.

The mechanics of the check scanning process are as follows:

. Sort checks by the bank account name into which they will be deposited.
. Add up the check totals for each bank account.

. Enter the first batch total in the scanning software.

. Scan the checks related to that batch.

. Verify that the scanned totals match the batch total. If not, adjust either the
batch total or individual check amounts.

Remote deposit capture does not work for foreign checks, which must still be
manually deposited at the bank.


6-7 Consolidate Bank Accounts 125

6-7 Consolidate Bank Accounts

A time-consuming chore at the beginning of each month is to complete reconcili-
ations between the bank statements for all the company’s bank accounts and the
book balances it maintains for each of those accounts. For example, a retail store
operation may have a separate bank account for each of hundreds of locations, each
of which must be reconciled. Also, if it is the controller’s policy to wait for all bank
accounts to be reconciled before issuing financial statements, this can be the
primary bottleneck operation of the monthly close. Finally, having many bank
accounts raises the possibility that cash will linger in all of those accounts, resulting
in less total cash being available for investment purposes. For example, if there are
100 retail stores and each has a bank account in which is deposited $5,000
(a decidedly modest sum for a single location), then $500,000 has been rendered
unavailable for investment. Thus, having a multitude of bank accounts leads to a
variety of downstream problems, which can seriously impact the efficiency of
some portions of the accounting department, while also reducing the amount of
cash readily available for investment purposes.

The best solution is to merge as many of them together as possible. To use the
previous example, rather than give a bank account to each store, it may be possible
to issue a fixed number of checks to each location, all of which will be drawn upon
the company’s central bank account. This reduces the number of bank accounts
from 100 to one. If anyone feels that there is a danger of someone’s fraudulently
cashing a large check on the main bank account, this problem can be resolved by
mandating a maximum amount for each check, above which the bank will not
honor the check. By limiting the amount per check and the number of checks, this
control effectively resolves any risk of a major fraud loss by consolidating all bank
accounts. This is also an effective approach when acquiring another company,
since its bank accounts can be merged into the existing account. In both cases,
reducing the number of accounts also makes it much easier to track the cash
balances in each account. Thus, account consolidation is an effective approach for
improving accounting efficiency as well as the management of cash flows.

There are some problems to consider before consolidating bank accounts. First,
there may be automatic withdrawals taken out of an account. If the account is closed
down and merged into a different account, the automatic withdrawal will be
terminated, resulting in an unhappy supplier who is no longer receiving any money.
To avoid this problem, review all transactions impacting each account to ensure that
all automatic withdrawals are being shifted to the consolidated account. Also, there
are legal reasons for keeping some accounts separate, such as a flexible spending
account, into which employee deductions are deposited and from which a plan
administrator withdraws funds. Finally, consolidating too many bank accounts may
result in a very difficult bank reconciliation chore. Sometimes it is easier to keep a


126 Cash Management Best Practices

small number of separate accounts, just to make the reconciliation process somewhat
easier to untangle and resolve. However, with the exception of these few cases, it is
generally possible to reduce the number of bank accounts to a bare minimum,
resulting in greater efficiency and more cash available for investment.

6-8 Implement Physical Cash Sweeping

When a company sets up a zero-balance account, its bank automatically moves
cash from that account into a concentration account, usually within the same bank.
The cash balance in the zero-balance account (as the name implies) is reduced to
zero whenever a sweep occurs. If the account has a debit balance at the time of the
sweep, then money is shifted from the concentration account back into the account
having the debit balance. An example is shown in Exhibit 6.3.

In the example, two of three subsidiary accounts initially contain credit
(positive) balances, and Account C contains a debit (negative) balance. In the
first stage of the sweep transaction, the cash in the two accounts having credit
balances are swept into the concentration account. In the next stage of the sweep,
sufficient funds are transferred from the concentration account to offset the debit
balance in Account C. At the end of the sweep, then, there are no credit or debit
balances in the zero-balance accounts.

It is also possible to use constant balancing to maintain a predetermined
minimum balance in a subsidiary account, which involves sweeping only those
cash levels above the minimum balance, and reverse sweeping cash into the
subsidiary account if the balance drops below the minimum balance.

Daily sweeping may not be necessary outside of a company’s designated core
currencies. This is especially likely when noncore currency account balances are
relatively low. If so, it may be more cost effective to sweep them less frequently, or
to implement trigger balances. A trigger balance is an account balance level above
which excess funds are swept out of the account.

Some concentration banks can also monitor a company’s account balances at
third-party banks using SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunication) messages, and create transfer requests to move excess
cash to the concentration bank. The key point with account sweeping is to fully
automate it—the effort involved in manually tracking account balances and
shifting funds on a daily basis is not only expensive but also likely to cause errors.

In most sweeping transactions, the sweeps occur on an intraday basis, which
means that balances are transferred to the concentration account before the end of
the day. Consequently, some cash may be left behind in subsidiary accounts, rather
than being centralized. This occurs when cash arrives in an account after execution
of the daily sweep. The cash will remain in the subsidiary account overnight, and
be included in the following day’s sweep. If a bank can accomplish true end-of-day

sweeps, then no cash will be left behind in local accounts. If a company is not
dealing with such a bank, then a proactive approach to depositing checks before

cutoff times is the best way to avoid unused cash.

There may be a need to track the amounts of cash swept from each zero-balance
account into the concentration account; if so, the company records an intercompany


128

Cash Management Best Practices

loan from the subsidiary to the corporate parent in the amount of the cash transferred
through the cash concentration process. Here are four reasons for doing so:

1.

Subsidiary-level financial reporting requirements. A subsidiary may
have an outstanding loan, for which a bank requires the periodic production
of a balance sheet. Since account sweeping shifts cash away from a
subsidiary’s balance sheet, detailed sweep tracking is needed to put the
cash back on the subsidiary’s balance sheet for reporting purposes. This can
be done by recording an intercompany loan from the subsidiary to the
corporate parent in exchange for any swept cash, which can then be reversed
to place the cash back on the subsidiary’s balance sheet.

. Interest income allocation. A company may elect to allocate the interest

earned at the concentration account level back to the subsidiaries whose
accounts contributed cash to the concentration account. Some countries
require that this interest allocation be done, to keep a company from locating
the concentration account in a low-tax jurisdiction, where the tax on interest
income is minimized. Thus, the amounts of cash swept into and out of a
subsidiary account must be tracked in order to properly allocate the correct
proportion of interest income to that account.

. Interest expense allocation. Some tax jurisdictions may require the parent

company to record interest expense on intercompany loans associated with
the transfer of cash in a physical sweeping arrangement. If so, the company
must track the intercompany loan balances outstanding per day, which is
then used as the principal for the calculation of interest expense. The interest
rate used for these calculations should be the market rate; any other rate can
be construed by local tax authorities to be transfer pricing designed to shift
income into low-tax regions.

. Central bank reporting. Some central banks require that they be sent

reports on transfers between resident and nonresident accounts. This may be
handled by the company’s bank, but can still increase the administrative
burden associated with the sweep.

Some banks have the capability to track the amount of balance sweeps from

each subsidiary account on an ongoing basis, which a company can use as its
record of intercompany loans.

Implement Notional Pooling

Notional pooling is a mechanism for calculating interest on the combined credit
and debit balances of accounts that a corporate parent chooses to cluster together,


6-10 Charge Back Treasury Fees to Subsidiaries 129

without actually transferring any funds. This approach allows each subsidiary
company to take advantage of a single, centralized liquidity position, while still
retaining daily cash management privileges. Also, since it avoids the use of cash
transfers to a central pooling account, there is no need to create or monitor
intercompany loans, nor are there any bank fees related to cash transfers (since
there are no transfers). In addition, it largely eliminates the need to arrange
overdraft lines with local banks. Further, interest earnings tend to be higher than if
investments were made separately for the smaller individual accounts. Also, it
offers a solution for partially owned subsidiaries whose other owners may balk at
the prospect of physically transferring funds to an account controlled by another
entity. And finally, the use of notional pooling is not a long-term commitment; on
the contrary, it is relatively easy to back out of the arrangement.

Where global notional pooling is offered (usually where all participating
accounts are held within a single bank), the pool offsets credit and debit balances
on a multicurrency basis without the need to engage in any foreign exchange
transactions. An additional benefit of global notional pooling lies in the area of
intercompany cash flows; for example, if there are charges for administrative
services, the transaction can be accomplished with no net movement of cash.

Once a company earns interest on the funds in a notional account, interest
income is usually allocated back to each of the accounts composing the pool. For
tax management reasons, it may be useful for the corporate parent to charge the
subsidiaries participating in the pool for some cash-concentration administration
expenses related to management of the pool. This scenario works best if the
corporate subsidiaries are located in high-tax regions where reduced reportable
income will result in reduced taxes.

The main downside of notional pooling is that it is not allowed in some
countries, especially in portions of Africa, Asia, and Latin America (though it is
very common in Europe). In these excluded areas, physical cash sweeping is the
most common alternative. Also, the precise form of the notional pooling arrange-
ment will vary according to local laws so that some countries allow cross-border
pooling while others do not.

In addition to the prohibition against notional pooling in some countries, it is
difficult to find anything but a large multinational bank that offers cross-currency
notional pooling. Instead, it is most common to have a separate notional cash pool
for each currency area.

6-10 Charge Back Treasury Fees to Subsidiaries

If a company elects to use either physical cash sweeping or notional pooling, as
described earlier, the corporate treasury staff will record an expense associated
with either service. The cash concentration strategy should generate interest


130 Cash Management Best Practices

income that is allocated back to the subsidiaries from which the cash was extracted.
If so, consider charging a reasonable amount of treasury expenses back to the
subsidiaries, to reflect the corporate group’s assistance in managing cash. This
approach is particularly useful if company subsidiaries are located in high-tax
areas, since the expense allocation will reduce their taxable income and result in a
net companywide reduction in total income taxes paid.

Cost: Sy Installation time:

6-11 Implement Controlled Disbursements

The person who is in charge of managing corporate cash flows is always trying to
find ways to retain cash for investment purposes, thereby earning interest for a
company. There are unethical ways of doing so, such as not paying suppliers even
when previously agreed-upon pay dates have been surpassed. However, these
activities can destroy a company’s reputation with its suppliers and even impact its
credit rating.

A legitimate way to retain cash for an extra day or two is to use controlled
disbursements. This best practice is based on the principle of mail float, which
means that one can print and immediately mail a check to pay for an invoice on its
due date and the supplier can receive and cash it, but the check will not clear for a
day or two longer than was previously the case, resulting in extra time during
which a company still has control over its funds. For example, a company in
Denver can issue checks that are made payable to a bank in Aspen, Colorado,
which, due to its isolated location, requires an extra day for checks to clear. When
checks are presented to the Aspen location for payment, a daily batch of cash
required to cover the payments is forwarded to the company’s primary bank. The
company can access this cash requirement information every day and forward just
enough money to the controlled disbursement account to cover cash requirements
for that day. These extra steps give a company the capability to keep virtually all of
its excess cash in investments, extracting only the bare minimum each day to cover
immediate cash requirements. Thus, controlled disbursements not only allow a
company to retain its cash longer but also to use the new off-site bank account as a
zero-balance account. Both of these actions can significantly increase the amount
of a company’s operating funds on hand.

One problem with a controlled-disbursements account is that the amount of
additional float made available through this method is gradually shrinking, as the
Federal Reserve Bank gradually eliminates those pockets of inefficient check
clearing throughout the country. This may require a company to periodically
change the location of the bank that it uses as its check-clearing point. Eventually,
the longest additional float time to be gained by this method will probably be
limited to a single day. Also, the concept is one of the most expensive bank


6-13 Open Zero-Balance Accounts 131

services. Consequently, the cost must be carefully calculated and offset against
projected benefits to ensure that it is a worthwhile implementation project.

Given the cost of controlled disbursements, this is a best practice that is best
used by a company with a significant volume of cash flow, which ensures that the
incremental benefits of retaining a large amount of cash for an extra day or two will
adequately offset the cost of this service.

Cost: S-¥ Installation time:

6-12 Negotiate Faster Deposited-Check Availability

One of the standard tricks used by banks to create a larger store of funds that they
can invest is to delay the availability of money from deposited checks. You can see
delays of as long as five days for some checks, and much longer periods for checks
drawn on international banks, even though the checks may have cleared much
sooner. As a general rule, if checks are not clearing the bank within two days, then
it is time to either negotiate with the bank to reduce the amount of float it is taking
or to switch to another bank that is willing to make money available within a
shorter time frame.

This option is not a realistic one for smaller businesses, since they have
minimal leverage with their banks. Also, some companies that deal with many out-
of-state customers will experience a much slower actual check-clearing time than
those whose customers are located within the same state—this simply reflects the
mechanics of the check-clearing process and cannot be accelerated below a
minimum level.

Cost: S-¥ Installation time:

6-13 Open Zero-Balance Accounts

Whenever a company cuts a check to a supplier, it must deposit enough cash in its
checking account to cover payment on the check. If it does not do so, then the bank
may not honor the check when it is presented for payment, or it may advance
payment but charge a fee for doing so. In either case, the penalties are considerable
for not having sufficient cash on hand to cover company obligations. Many
companies run the risk of not having sufficient funds on hand because they want to
earn interest on their money for as long as possible (most checking accounts do not
pay interest, or very little). Accordingly, the typical organization assigns someone
the task of monitoring the rate at which checks are being cashed, guesses when
checks will be cashed, and uses all sorts of time-consuming averaging methods to
make a reasonable guess as to how much money should be left in the account each


132 Cash Management Best Practices

day. Not only is this an expensive way to manage cash, but sometimes those
guesses are wrong, resulting in bounced checks or additional bank fees.

The zero-balance account is a better way. As its name implies, the zero-
balance account requires no balance. Instead, when checks are presented to the
bank for payment, the bank automatically transfers money from another company
account, in the exact amount required to cover the check. This approach allows a
company to store all funds in just one account, where it is easier to track and invest.
There is also no problem with forgetting to manually transfer funds into the zero-
balance account because all transactions are handled automatically. There is no
risk of not having cash available to pay for a check, unless there are no funds in the
account from which money is automatically being drawn. A common use of the
zero-balance account is for payroll checks. A variation on this type of account is
the controlled disbursement account (see best practice 6-11, “Implement Con-
trolled Disbursements,” earlier in this chapter), which is most commonly used for
accounts payable checks. By using either or both of these types of accounts, a
company can consolidate its funds into a central holding account, where it is both
more visible and easily transferred out to various investment vehicles.

One problem with a zero-balance account is that the bank will charge a small
monthly fee for maintaining the account, but this fee is easily offset by the interest
earned on money that would otherwise have been sitting in the account. In
addition, some very small companies with limited banking needs do not bother
with a zero-balance account because they do not like the notion of having extra
complexity in their banking procedures. These small organizations prefer to handle
all banking transactions through a single bank account, which is certainly an
acceptable approach when there is a limited volume of cash flow in and out of a
company. With the exception of these two cases, however, most companies will
find that having a zero-balance account is an excellent way to centralize their funds
in a single location.

Summary

This chapter is unusual in that none of the best practices presented are mutually
exclusive, nor are any of them especially difficult to implement, and most can be
created at low cost. As a result, this is a prime area for an accounting manager to
explore in order to achieve the highest possible level of cash management
efficiency. Best of all, efficiency in this area directly equates to having more
cash available for investments, which has a direct impact on company profits—one
of the few functions covered in this book in which corporate management can see
an immediate and measurable impact as a result of implementing best practices.

Given the high visibility of implementing cash management best practices, it
is important to install as many of them as possible. In particular, there should be a


Summary 133

set of lockboxes in place that will reduce the mail float from customers, as well as
cash-sweeping processes that accumulate funds from the lockbox accounts and
move them to the central bank account. There should also be zero-balance accounts
to handle cashed payroll checks, and a controlled-disbursement account for paying
suppliers. If this array of bank accounts is in place and is properly managed, there
should be a noticeable increase in the average amount of funds on hand that can be
profitably invested.

Collections Best Practices

One of the worst jobs in any company is collecting on overdue accounts receivable.
The person who must do the collecting never knows if an invoice has gone unpaid
due to the company’s fault or the customer’s. There may be a very valid problem
caused by the company that is making the customer wait on payment of the
invoice, such as a damaged product shipment, a billing for the incorrect amount, or
pricing that does not match the customer’s purchase order amount. In these cases,
the collections person apologizes to the customer for the company’s sins and then
tries to correct the internal problems responsible for the collection trouble. In other
cases, the collections problem may be caused by the customer, who either cannot
pay or who is deliberately stretching the payment period past the agreed-upon date.
In such situations, the collections person must diplomatically bring pressure to bear
on the customer, which is a difficult skill. No matter what the reason for an invoice
being overdue, the collections person must ascertain the correct reason for the
problem and fix it.

This chapter provides many best practices that allow a collections staff to
reduce the error rate of invoices being sent to customers, while also providing new
tools to force customers to pay by the due dates listed on company invoices. In
addition, there are several best practices here that can enhance the operational
efficiency of the collections staff. In short, this chapter makes the collections task
easier, while reducing the amount of overdue accounts receivable at the same time.

programming or that involve the participation of another department. In these two
cases, either the risk of a lengthy programming project or the refusal of another
department to cooperate can jeopardize a successful implementation. An example
of the first problem is automatically faxing overdue invoices to customers, while a
good example of the second problem is persuading the sales department to adopt a
simplified pricing structure. However, with the exception of these two problem
areas, one will find that improving the collections function with the best practices
contained in this chapter is a relatively easy endeavor.

7-1 Accept Check Payments by Fax

A serious collection dilemma for the collections person is having a dilatory
customer say the check is being mailed—which then takes an unpardonable
amount of time to arrive, indicating that the check was not mailed right away. If the
collections person asks that a check be sent by overnight delivery service, then
either the customer balks at the extra cost or the company must pay the fee.

An alternative delivery method is check-by-fax. Under this approach, the
customer faxes the completed and signed check to the collections person, who
promptly enters information from the check into check-printing software that is readily
available from a number of companies. The company then prints the checks using
approved check security paper, which is readily available from an office supply store.
The check is created using standard printer ink, not magnetic ink character recognition
(MICR) ink. The check will not have a signature line. Instead, it will contain a block of
text where the signature line was, stating something similar to the following:


138 Collections Best Practices

 

SIGNATURE NOT REQUIRED

Payment has been authorized by the depositor. Payee to hold
you harmless for payment of this document. This document
shall be deposited only to credit of payee. Absence of
endorsement is guaranteed by payee’s bank.

 

The company then deposits the check with its bank. The bank may need to
process the check manually, since it does not use MICR ink, but it should accept
the check. The net result of this process is that the company has eliminated the mail
float from the collection process.

Because the company must obtain the customer’s authorization, it is useful to
retain a copy of the faxed check. A variation is to send the customer a check
authorization form, which the customer fills out and returns by fax, along with a
voided check. The information used in this process can also be collected over the
phone, but that approach is not recommended, since it is prone to error and also
results in no documentary evidence from the customer.

7-2 Clearly Define Account Ownership

The sales staff is frequently unwilling to make collection calls on behalf of the
accounting staff, because this takes away from their time in making new sales.
However, the best contact with the customer is the salesperson, who has probably
met with the customer multiple times and has built up a firm relationship, thereby
making the salesperson the most effective collections person a company has.

To improve the collections process, a company should clearly define who
“owns” each customer account and assign collection responsibility to the sales-
person who has been given account ownership. “Ownership” means that the
salesperson’s name or sales region number should be included in the accounting
database for each customer name. This does not mean that the bulk of the sales
staff's job is now collections, but rather that the accounting department’s collec-
tions staff can now call on specific individuals in the sales department when they
feel that they will not otherwise collect payment on an invoice. To enhance the
cooperation of the sales staff in the enforcement of collections, the compensation
of the sales department manager should be tied to the proportion of cash collected
from customers, which will entice this person to force the cooperation of his or her
staff with the accounting department.

This concept should also be extended to the collections staff. There are usually
specific customer issues associated with the nonpayment of an invoice, which must
be repetitively researched if a collection problem is circulated throughout the

collection staff. A better approach is to assign customer accounts to specific
collections personnel. By doing so, they gain an understanding of each customer’s
particular issues, as well as have a chance to build relationships with their accounts
payable counterparts at the customers’ place of business, which frequently results
in faster resolution of issues and therefore quicker payment by customers.

7-3 Optimize the Collections Staff

The effectiveness of the collections department depends on the ability of its staff to
collect the highest possible percentage of funds from overdue customers. How-
ever, consider the tasks they are assigned—reviewing the aging report for target
customers, looking up contact information, pulling account files, contacting
customers, tracking promise dates, sending out letters, and so on. Of these tasks,
only one results in collections—the actual customer contact. All of the other
activities reduce the effectiveness of the collections staff because they are
administrative in nature.

If those employees who are best at collections must handle all associated
activities, then they will have far less time to make collection calls so that the
department manager must either hire and train additional employees to be
collectors or accept a low level of favorable collection results.

The solution is to hire administrative staff to assist the collectors with all
activities not directly associated with customer contacts. This means that someone
else should determine which accounts should be contacted, look up contact
information, pull account files, track promise dates, and send out follow-up
letters—in short, every collections activity previously noted, except for the actual
customer contact. Further, do not require collections personnel to attend
unnecessary meetings or do anything that detracts from their core mission of
collecting money from customers. If this seems like an expensive alternative, then
consider how much more money the collections staff could obtain from customers
if they had a laser focus on customer contacts, and nothing else.

The department manager must come to a key realization when taking this
approach, which is that a top-quality collections person is a prized asset whose time
must be carefully directed toward realizing the highest possible collection rate.
Collectors are, in effect, the bottleneck in the collections department, so their time
must be carefully managed.

Once the time of the collections staff has been fully optimized, the department
manager can consider going a step further and assigning the best collections staff to
the most difficult customers. This highly skilled group is the most likely to achieve
the best possible collection percentage. However, this approach does not work so
well if a bonus system is in place for rewarding high collection rates, because the


140 Collections Best Practices

best collections people are now being assigned the most intractable customers.
This concept also gets away from the concept of giving all of the collections staff a
level playing field for comparison to each other, since their portfolio sizes and
clients are no longer comparable. Consequently, taking this extra step calls for
considerable prior discussion of its downside impact on the staff.

7-4 Designate a Skip Tracing Specialist

The collections staff is trained in the art of collecting money from a company’s
customers, but it is not necessarily trained in how to track down those customers
who do not wish to be found. If the staff cannot contact someone, it tends to stop all
collection efforts or shift the account over to a collection agency, rather than invest
any additional time in trying to track down the customer.

Skip tracing is the art of locating a debtor who does not want to be found. It
requires knowledge of various databases that are not normally used by a collections
person, natural inquisitiveness, and dogged determination. In other words, only a
particular kind of person performs well in skip tracing, and that person is not
necessarily a collections person. Instead, consider hiring an experienced skip tracer
and providing some of that person’s compensation based on a share of any funds
recovered.

An alternative is to outsource this function to a professional skip tracer.
However, do not expect to pay a few dollars for a thorough skip trace. Though the
Internet is replete with advertisements for skip traces costing $100 or less, such
searches are only for perfunctory perusals of a few common databases. For a
detailed search, expect to pay a skip tracer on an hourly basis, and set a maximum
number of hours for each trace. If the company is searching for a judgment debtor,
then many states allow the company to add collection fees to the principal amount
of the judgment, which may make this a more palatable alternative.

Before conducting a skip trace, be sure to make a rational, hard-headed
decision regarding whether this is worth the time. A really thorough skip trace can
require many hours, so is it worth the effort if the amount owed by the debtor is not
large? With this issue in mind, most skip tracers will initially conduct only a brief
search of easily accessible databases before proceeding further. Part of this initial
search should include bankruptcy records, since a recent bankruptcy will likely
force the skip tracer to cancel any additional activities.

Here are some location techniques that skip tracers use:

1. Send an empty envelope to their latest known address, with “Do Not
Forward—Address Correction Requested” stamped on it. The Post
Office will return it in about a week with the target’s forwarding address.


7-5 Utilize Collection Call Stratification 141

2. Use People Search on www.411.com. This online database is a simple way
to locate by name anyone who resides in the United States. The skip tracer
can also enter their phone number or e-mail address in the same site, and it
will sometimes return an address. The results are spotty, but this is worth a
few minutes of staff time.

3. Use caller ID on incoming calls. Sometimes enough inquiries will result in
the target calling the skip tracer, just to see what the person wants. If so, have
caller ID, so the skip tracer can identify the target and store his or her phone
number. Then use the Reverse Phone search on www.411.com to determine
their address.

4. Conduct a search on a search engine. Though a name search on Google may
return thousands of Web links, putting the name in quotes and adding a few key
words about the target will rapidly reduce the number of relevant links.

5. Conduct a search through a paid database service. These online sites
provide access to records of inmates, births and deaths, marriages, divorces,
reverse phone records, and Department of Motor Vehicle records. Expect to
pay anywhere from $7.50 for a simple record search to $50 for a thorough
analysis.

6. Contact friends, coworkers, relatives, and neighbors. Though time
consuming, this can be an extremely effective approach. The target usually
slips and lets someone know their new address, so persistence pays. An
especially effective approach is to contact the former landlord, who may
have the target’s credit application on file. If so, this may contain all kinds of
useful tracing information.

Whatever method used, the skip tracer should keep a formal log of results that
includes the target’s key personal information, as well as the results of every type
of search already listed. This consolidates records in one place and ensures that the
skip tracer does not duplicate any steps.

7-5 Utilize Collection Call Stratification

The typical list of overdue invoices is so long that the existing collections staff
cannot possibly contact all customers about all invoices on a sufficiently frequent
basis. This problem results in many invoices not being collected for an inordinately
long time. Additional problems requiring time-consuming research may include an
incorrect product price, missing shipping documentation, or a claim that the
quantity billed is incorrect. Consequently, collection problems linger longer than
they should, resulting in slow collections and substandard cash flow.


142 Collections Best Practices

A good approach for improving the speed of cash collection is to utilize
collection call stratification. The concept behind this approach is to split up, or
stratify, all of the overdue receivables and concentrate the bulk of the collections
staffs time on the very largest invoices. By doing so, a company can realize
improved cash flow by collecting the largest dollar amounts sooner. The downside
is that smaller invoices will receive less attention and therefore take longer to
collect, but this is a reasonable shortcoming if the overall cash flow from using
stratified collections is improved. To implement it, perform a Pareto analysis of a
typical accounts receivable listing and determine the cutoff point above which
20 percent of all invoices will constitute 80 percent of the total revenue. For
example, a cutoff point of $1,000 means that any invoice of more than $1,000 is in
the group of invoices that represents the bulk of a company’s revenue. When it is
necessary to contact customers for collections work, a much higher number of
customer contacts can be assigned for the invoices over $1,000. For example, a
collections staff can be required to contact customers about all high-dollar invoices
once every three days, whereas low-dollar contacts can be limited to once every
two weeks. By allocating the time of the collections staff in this manner, it is
possible to improve cash flow.

The stratification approach can also be expanded to include other members of
acompany. If there is an extremely large invoice that must be collected at once, the
collections staff can be authorized to request the services of other departments,
such as the sales staff, in making the collection. This approach needs to be limited
to large-dollar invoices, since the sales staff does not want to be making collection
calls all day. However, using the stratification approach, it is reasonable to request
their assistance in collecting just the largest invoices.

7-6 Structure the Workday Around Prime Calling Hours

The prime calling hours for most business customers are in the early to mid-
morning, before they have been called away for meetings or other activities. If
customers are concentrated in a single time zone, this can mean that the time period
available for calls is extremely short and is a particular problem if the collections
staff is not prepared to call customers during that time period. Also, if the customer
base spans multiple time zones, a collections staff based in one time zone may be
making calls to customers that are outside the customers’ prime calling hours,
resulting in few completed calls.

Awareness of prime calling hours for individual customers is key. The
collections manager should avoid attending any meetings during prime calling
hours, instead focusing on having the collections staff fully prepared to make
calls, with all required information close at hand. Furthermore, the rest of the


7-7 Base Deduction Management on Transaction Volume 143

organization should be made aware of this time block and be asked to avoid contact
with the collections department during that period. In addition, the collections
manager should require a collections workday that is built around prime calling
hours. For example, if the collections staff is based on the West Coast but most of
its customer contacts are on the East Coast, its workday should begin very early to
make up for the three-hour time difference.

The collections staff should be aware of the time zone they are calling before
making the call, so they do not inadvertently place calls outside a customer’s prime
calling hours. To be even more precise, it may be useful to record the exact time
when a customer answers the phone, thereby establishing when that person may be
available again for future calls.

Most of these recommendations are simple, requiring only changes to the
collections staff’s schedule. The use of a computer system to track times when
customers answer the phone, or to set up a calling queue based on customer time
zones, can be substantially more expensive, but this process can begin with simple
paper-based systems.

7-7 Base Deduction Management on Transaction Volume

The collections staff may be experiencing a flood of payment deductions or just a
trickle. If there is a considerable volume of deductions, then the accounting
manager will have a difficult time allocating deduction resolution work among the
staff, which will resist the extra workload that is added to their other chores.
Conversely, if there are just a few deductions, the common response is to let them
pile up until a sufficient volume exists to keep someone busy for a longer block of
time—which results in deductions lingering on the accounts receivable aging
report.

The best approach for managing these deductions varies based on the
incoming volume. For instance, if the collections staff is inundated with deduc-
tions, it makes more sense to assign deduction resolution work to people who
specialize in a particular type of deduction, such as problems with shipment
damage, pricing complaints, or product returns. This means that if a customer takes
multiple types of deductions on one invoice, it may receive calls from a different
clerk for each of the deductions. This may not seem efficient from the customer’s
perspective, but it works well for the company.

A different approach is used when there is a low volume of deductions. In this
scenario, it makes more sense to leverage the collection staffs personal knowledge
of each customer to resolve items on a case-by-case basis. Further, there is not
enough deduction volume to make it cost effective to employ a clerk full time on
deductions in general or on a single type of deduction.


144 Collections Best Practices

A hybrid approach is to assign a specialist deduction clerk to a single type of
deduction for which the company is experiencing high volume, but not for other
types of deductions with lower volume levels.

7-8 Set Up a Periodic Payment Schedule

A customer may have a short-term cash flow problem and promises to pay in a few
months, once some unspecified amount of cash is received. This places the
collector in the awkward position of essentially authorizing a short-term loan
to the customer, for which there is still no guarantee of payment. Also, once the
customer’s cash flow improves, whatever goods or services were provided by the
company will seem to be in the distant past, and so the associated payments are
likely to be shunted aside in favor of newer and more immediately required
payments.

One solution is to set up a periodic payment plan. By convincing the customer
to make some payments in the near term, the company is gradually reducing the
amount of what may otherwise be a long-term receivable. Also, this approach gets
the customer into the mode of making payments on a set schedule, so the company
can eventually be paid in full even if its expected cash inflows never occur.

Collectors may be tempted to use this approach too much, because they can
show some receipts in the near term. However, because the company is also
extending an interest-free loan through this best practice, the credit manager or
controller should personally approve all periodic payments exceeding a prede-
termined limit.

7-9 Require Customer Billing of Marketing Deductions

Customer payment deductions can be caused by a variety of problems and
issues, such as damaged goods, incorrect pricing, and marketing promotions. It
is extremely difficult for the accounting staff to sort through the various deduction
causes and disposition them. Of particular concern are deductions for marketing
promotions, since the accounting staff probably has no access to the promotions,
and does not know which ones are valid.

One way to completely avoid marketing deductions is to require customers to
invoice the company for them, rather than taking them as deductions. By doing so,
the accounts payable staff merely forwards them to the marketing department for


7-10 Grant Percentage Discounts for Early Payment 145

approval, and the company pays the customer; the accounts receivable staff no
longer sees these deductions at all, which can reduce the overall volume of
deductions considerably.

The accounting staff should assist the marketing manager in writing a
procedure for customers, stating the process flow to be followed for the reim-
bursement of marketing promotions. Many customers have gotten into the habit of
taking these promotions as deductions, so a considerable amount of customer
retraining may be required.

A variation on this approach can be used when the marketing department
creates “co-op” advertising allowances for customers. If these allowances are
stored in the accounting system, then all deductions can be automatically charged
against a customer’s co-op allowance total. While this approach does eliminate
deductions, it does so indiscriminately, with some nonmarketing deductions
inevitably disappearing into the co-op allowance bucket.

7-10 Grant Percentage Discounts for Early Payment

Some companies have large customers that pay late all the time. These customers
are important to the company, and the customers abuse the one-sidedness of the
relationship by stretching out their payments. In these cases, a company has little
leverage, for it will lose a significant volume of sales if it cuts off the errant
customers or cuts back on their credit limits.

In these cases, a company may have no choice other than to grant an early
payment discount to customers in order to bring in cash sooner. This approach is
especially effective if a company is in immediate need of cash. Also, accounts
receivable that are outstanding for a long time period will require a number of
collection actions, whereas one that is paid immediately will not require any; thus,
the use of an early payment discount reduces the cost of collections.

The discount is an easy one to implement. A company usually prints the
discount on its invoices so that customers will see it the next time an invoice is
mailed to them. However, most customers already have payment terms included in
their payment databases and a sudden change in terms may not be noticed.
Accordingly, it may be necessary to call the customers’ accounts payable staffs to
notify them of the change. An alternative approach is to offer the discount only to a
few key customers representing a high volume of sales or who are constant late
payers. By reducing the number of customers who take discounts, a company can
make more selective use of this tool. Another variation is to only offer the early
payment discount if a customer pays the full invoice amount. With this rule in
place, customers will be less likely to subtract deductions from the invoice amount,
since they will be losing a valuable early payment discount. The rule still allows


146 Collections Best Practices

customers to dispute payments after making a payment, but at least the company
now has received full payment, and so has better control over the dispute.
There are three problems with using an early payment discount. One is the
cost. To entice a customer into an early payment, the discount rate must be fairly
high. A common discount rate is 2 percent, which translates into a significant
expense if used by all customers. Another problem is that it is somewhat more
difficult to apply cash against accounts receivable if a discount is taken. Depending
on the facility of the accounting software, an accounting clerk may have to go to
the extreme of manually calculating the discount amount taken and charging off
the difference to a special discounts account. Finally, a discount can be abused. If a
customer is already stretching its payments, it may take the discount rate without
shrinking its payment interval to the prescribed number of days. This can lead to
endless arguments over whether the discount should have been taken, which the
customer will win if it makes up a large enough percentage of a company’s sales.
Granting early payment discounts can significantly reduce the amount of a
company’s overdue accounts receivable, but this is at the high cost of the discount,
which can be abused by some customers. Accordingly, this best practice should be
used with care to improve the payment performance of selected customers.

7-11 Conduct Immediate Review of Unapplied Cash

It is a common occurrence for a collections person to call a customer about an
overdue invoice, only to be told that the check was already sent. Upon further
investigation, the collections staff finds that, for a variety of reasons, the errant
check has been sitting in an accounting clerk’s “in” box for several weeks, waiting
to be applied to an invoice in the accounts receivable aging. Common reasons for
not performing this cash application include not having enough time, not under-
standing what the check is intended to pay, or because there are unexplained line
items on a payment, such as credits, that require further investigation before the
check can be applied.

None of the reasons for not applying cash are valid, given the consequences of
wasting the time of the collections staff. Only two solutions need to be installed to
ensure that cash is applied at once. First, cash application is always the highest
priority of whomever is responsible for it, thereby avoiding all arguments
regarding other items taking priority, or not having enough time to complete
the task. Second, all cash must be applied, even if it is only to an “unapplied cash”
category in the accounts receivable register for those items that cannot be traced
immediately to an open invoice. In these cases, simply having the total of
unapplied cash for a customer clearly shown in the aged accounts receivable
listing is a clear sign that the customer is correct—it has paid for an invoice and


7-12 Outsource Collections 147

now the collections person knows how to apply the cash that was already received.
Applying cash to accounts receivable as soon as it is received is critical to ensuring
that the collections staff has complete information about customer payments before
calling a customer.

Ensuring that cash is applied on time is a key internal auditing task. Without
periodic review by a designated auditor, the person in charge of cash applications
may become lazy and delay some application work. To avoid this problem, audits
must be regularly scheduled and should verify not only that all cash is applied in a
timely manner, but that the amount of cash received each day matches the amount
applied. If these controls are rigidly followed, it becomes an easy matter to enforce
this most fundamental of best practices.

7-12 Outsource Collections

Some companies have a very difficult time creating an effective collections
department. Perhaps the management of the function is poor, or the staff is not
well trained, or it does not have sufficient sway over other departments, such as
sales, to garner support in changing underlying systems in a way that will reduce
the amount of accounts receivable to collect. Whatever the reason or combination
of reasons may be, there are times when the function simply does not work. A
variation on this situation is when a collections staff is so overwhelmed with work
that it cannot pay a sufficient amount of attention to the most difficult collection
items. This is amuch more common problem. In either case, the solution may be to
go outside the company for help.

One solution is to outsource the entire function or some portion of it. When
doing so, a company sends its accounts receivable aging report to a collections
agency, which contacts all customers with overdue invoices that have reached a
prespecified age—perhaps 60 days old, or whatever the agreement with the
supplier may specify. The supplier is then responsible for bringing in the funds.
In exchange, the collections agency either requires a percentage of each collected
invoice (typically one third) as payment for its services or it charges an hourly rate
for its efforts. It is almost always less expensive to pay an hourly fee for collection
services, rather than a percentage of the amounts collected, though going with an
hourly approach gives the supplier less incentive to collect payments. One way to
reduce the cost of a collections agency is to have a 10-day free demand period in
the contract. This means that a payment made by a debtor within 10 days of placing
the account with the agency will not require an agency collection fee. To
counteract the reduced level of incentive, it is useful to continually measure
the collection effectiveness of the supplier, and switch to a new supplier if only a
low percentage of invoices is being collected. This can be an effective approach for


148 Collections Best Practices

quickly bringing a trained group of collection professionals to bear on an existing
collections problem.

Before deciding on the outsourcing route, consider a variety of important
issues that make this a solution for only a minority of situations. One problem is
cost. It is always cheaper to keep the collections function in-house because the fees
charged by any supplier must include a profit, which automatically makes its
services more expensive. This is a particularly important problem if the payment
method is a percentage of the invoices collected, since the percentage can be
considerable. Another problem is that this approach does not allow you to use most
of the other best practices that are discussed in this chapter—by moving the entire
function elsewhere, there is no longer any reason to improve the department’s
efficiency. Only a few best practices, those that involve other departments, such as
the sales and credit departments, are still available for implementation. Finally, and
most important, outsourcing the collections function puts the emphasis of the
department squarely on collecting money, rather than on the equally important
issue of correcting the underlying problems that are causing customers to not pay
their bills on time. A collections supplier has absolutely no incentive to inform a
company of why customers are not paying, because by doing so it is giving a
company information that will reduce the number of overdue invoices and reduce
the amount of its business. For example, if a customer does not pay its bills because
a company repeatedly misprices the products it is selling, the collections agency
will not inform the company of its error because then the invoices will be fixed and
there will be fewer invoices to collect. All of these issues are major ones, requiring
considerable deliberation before a company decides to outsource its collections
function. Typically, this best practice should only be used in situations where a
company wants to outsource the collection of a few of its most difficult collection
problems. In most other cases, it is infinitely less expensive to go in search of a
qualified manager who can bring the collections department up to a peak level of
efficiency.

7-13 Prepare a Customer Bankruptcy Action Plan

When a customer files for bankruptcy protection, a company may find itself losing
access to valuable assets if it does not act in a rapid and coordinated manner across
several departments. Accordingly, the controller should create a customer bank-
ruptcy action plan, and activate it immediately upon notice of a customer’s
bankruptcy filing. Here are six key steps to include in the plan:

¢ Stop shipments in process or transit. Contact the warehouse manager to see
if any shipments are in transit, and have them recalled, if possible. Similarly,


7-14 Sell Your Bankruptcy Creditor Claim 149

contact the production scheduling staff and cancel any of the customer’s
production orders.

¢ Demand product reclamation. Make a demand in writing within 10 days of
the customer’s receipt of goods that the company has shipped to it, asking for
the immediate return of those specific goods. Although the bankruptcy court
might not allow the return, it might allow the company better treatment of its
claim, such as payment in front of general creditors.

¢ Stop payables in process. Contact the accounts payable manager and halt any
payments that may be in process to the customer. The company can use these
payables to offset an unpaid debt owed by the customer to the company.

¢ Review customer contracts. Contact the corporate legal department for a
copy of any current contracts between the company and the customer to see if
the company is under any delivery obligations to the customer, and what the
company’s rights are in terminating the contract. This is a particular problem if
there is a master purchase order (MPO) between the company and the
customer, since the company must continue to honor the MPO until it expires.

¢ Obtain critical vendor status. If the company has a key supplier relationship
with the customer, the customer can request that the bankruptcy court
authorize it to immediately pay the company’s claim, or some portion of
it, in exchange for the company continuing to sell to the customer on credit.

¢ Copy the notice to corporate counsel. Be sure to send the bankruptcy notice
to corporate counsel, who may wish to take additional actions if the company
is owed a substantial amount by the customer.

In addition to these steps, the accounting staff should review the customer’s list
of debts owed to the company and file a proof of claim with the bankruptcy court if
the document is missing any debts. The proof of claim form should include the name
of the company, the amount claimed, the documents proving the claim, and whether
the claim is secured. If the claim is secured, then it is assigned a priority ahead of
unsecured claims, so be sure to indicate this in the claim. However, filing a proof of
claim occurs some months after the initial bankruptcy notice, and so does not require
the immediate action demanded by the steps just described.

7-14 Sell Your Bankruptcy Creditor Claim

Despite a company’s best efforts at credit screening, customers will occasionally
end up in bankruptcy court. Though you may have a reasonable claim with an
expectation of eventually being paid, it still may take well over a year for the
customer to pay all claims, usually at pennies on the dollar. Further, payments are
likely to be in the customer’s stock, rather than cash, and the stock will probably be


150 Collections Best Practices

restricted. Also, someone on the company’s accounting or legal staffs must take the
time to monitor the case as it drags through bankruptcy court. Finally, the
company’s bank will not allow any receivables from a bankrupt customer in
the calculation of its borrowing base, which restricts the amount of money that the
company can borrow.

A reasonable alternative is to see the claim to a third party for cash. The third
party then pursues the claim, with the hope of eventually earning a good return on
its investment. The usual approach is for a potential purchaser to estimate the
proportion of the claim likely to be paid, and then discount this amount based on
the likely duration of the bankruptcy process before the claim is paid. If the creditor
offers to sell its claims for an amount equal to or less than the discounted value
calculated by the purchaser, then the deal will likely be completed. Claims
purchasers also acquire multiple creditor claims in order to have greater control
over approval of the bankrupt company’s workout plan, potentially increasing the
potential payout to the claims purchaser.

To ensure the highest possible value when selling a creditor claim, the
accounting staff should complete five steps:

¢ Maximize the claim. If the customer is disputing any part of the claim, then
contact the customer to resolve the issue immediately. Also, if the customer
has understated its debt to the company on its Schedule F, then file a proof of
claim with the bankruptcy court. Disputed claims are worth much less than
undisputed ones.

¢ Sell early. Pricing on creditor claims tend to drop over time, as more
information becomes available about the financial condition of the customer.
Conversely, pricing is higher just after the customer issues its Schedule F,
detailing all creditor claims, since this is the first time when claims purchasers
have access to this information, and may bid up prices.

¢ Shop the claim. It is generally best to delay acceptance of the first offer
received, because claims purchasers first try a general lowball offer to many
creditors, hoping to scoop up low prices from inexperienced sellers. Instead,
contact other claims purchasers to see if better offers are available. If the claim
has a security interest senior to that of general unsecured creditors, then it is
worth a great deal more than an unsecured claim.

¢ Demand immediate payment. If a claims purchaser wants to delay payment,
it may not have sufficient capital to issue the payment. Instead, sell to a
purchaser who offers immediate cash.

¢ Negotiate the claim refund provision. The claims purchaser will insist on a
claims refund provision, whereby the company must pay back the purchaser
(with interest) if the court disallows or reduces the company’s claim. It is
difficult to avoid this clause, but the company’s attorney should negotiate
down the interest rate, additional fees, and the definition of a disallowance or
claim reduction.


7-15 Simplify Pricing Structure 151

It is generally a good idea to sell a creditor claim, but proper attention to the
points noted here will both reduce a company’s risk of being taken advantage of by
a claims purchaser and maximize the size of the payment.

Cost: S-¥ Installation time: 9

7-15 Simplify Pricing Structure

A common problem for the collections staff is when they try to collect on an invoice
containing a pricing error. This problem most commonly arises when the order-entry
staff has a complicated set of rules to follow when deriving pricing. For example,
rather than using a single price for each product, there may be a different price for
various volume levels a customer orders—perhaps $1 per unit if 1,000 units are
ordered and $2 if only 500 units are ordered. The situation can become even more
complicated if there are special deals in place, such as an extra 10 percent discount if
an order is placed within a special time period, such as the last week of the month.
When all of these variations are included in the pricing structure (and some
companies have even more complicated systems), it is a wonder that the order-
entry staff ever manages to issue a correct product price! A special circumstance
under which pricing becomes nearly impossible to calculate is when the order-entry
department of an acquired company is merged with that of the buying company,
leaving the order-entry people with the pricing systems of the purchased company, as
well as that of their own. The inevitable result is that customers will frequently
disagree with the pricing on the invoices they receive and will not pay for them
without a long period of dissension regarding the correct price. Alternatively, they
will pay the price they think is the correct one, resulting in arguments over the
remainder. In either case, the collections staff must become involved.

The solution is a simplification of the pricing structure. The easiest pricing
structure to target is one that allows only one price to any customer for each
product, with no special discounts of any kind. By using this system, not only does
the collections staff have a much easier time, but so does the order-entry staff—
there is no need for them to make complicated calculations to arrive at a product
price. However, there are two main implementation barriers to this approach: the
sales staff and customers. The sales staff may be accustomed to a blizzard of
promotional discounts to move product and may also have a long tradition of using
volume discounts as a tool for shipping greater volume. Similarly, customers may
be used to the same situation, especially those that benefit from the current tangle
of pricing deals. To work through these barriers, it is critical for the controller to
clearly communicate to senior management the reasons why a complicated pricing
structure causes problems for the collections and order-entry staffs. The end result
is usually a political tug-of-war between the sales manager and controller; whoever
wins is the one with the most political muscle in the organization.


152 Collections Best Practices

Thus, simplifying the pricing structure is one of the most obvious ways to
reduce the difficulty of collections, but it can be very difficult to implement
because of resistance from the sales staff. You must build a clear case in favor of
pricing simplification and present it well before the concept can become a reality.

7-16 Write Off Small Balances with No Approval

The typical procedure for writing off a bad debt is for a collections person to
complete a bad-debt approval form, including an explanation of why an account
receivable is not collectible, which the controller must then review and sign. The
form is filed away, possibly for future review by auditors. This can be a time-
consuming process, but a necessary one if the amount of the bad debt is large.
However, some bad debts are so small that the cost of completing the associated
paperwork exceeds the bad debt. In short, the control point costs more than the
savings for small write-offs.

The obvious solution is to eliminate approvals for small amounts that are
overdue. You should determine the appropriate amount for the upper limit of items
that can be written off; an easy way to make this determination is to calculate the
cost of the collections staff’s time, as well as that of incidental costs, such as phone
calls. Any account receivable that is equal to or less than this cost should be written
off. The timing of the write-off, once again, depends on the particular circum-
stances of each company. Some may feel that it is best to wait until the end of the
year before writing off an invoice, while others promptly clear them out of the
accounts receivable aging as soon as they are 90 days old. Whatever the exact
criteria may be, it is important for management to stay out of the process once the
underlying guidelines have been set. By staying away, management is telling the
collections staff that it trusts employees to make these decisions on their own,
while also giving managers more time to deal with other issues. If managers feel
that they must check on the write-offs, they can let an internal audit team review the
situation from time to time.

By avoiding the approval process for writing off small accounts receivable,
the collections staff avoids unnecessary paperwork while managers eliminate a
waste of their time.

7-17 Report on Bad Debts by Salesperson

It is all too common for the sales staff to view themselves simply as the corporate
hunter-gatherers—they go in quest of new sales, and the rest of the company


7-19 Create an Accurate Bad-Debt Forecast 153

supports their quest. While theoretically noble, this means they do not see the
carnage that is sometimes wrought by landing the worst sort of customer. Although
the sales staff prefers to focus on the prime metric of gross dollars by salesperson,
corporate managers prefer to see profits by customer or salesperson.

A good solution is for the accounting staff to periodically issue a report listing
bad debts by salesperson. Because many sales should never have been made except
at the insistence of the sales staff, and many collections are never made because of
salespersons’ nonresponsiveness in assisting in the collection effort, this report
serves as a report card.

The bad-debt report must be issued with considerable caution, for it only shows
the bad side of the sales staff. Despite the negative tone just used to introduce this best
practice, the sales staff is in fact an exceedingly valuable part of the company. Thus, it
is best not to issue the report at all if there are reasons for a debt other than
salesperson-related issues (such as a customer getting into financial trouble after a
sale was concluded). Furthermore, considering the potential level of conflict this
report can engender, it is best to present it to the sales manager during a face-to-face
meeting and not to spray it all over the company with an e-mail distribution.

7-18 Post Collection Results by Collector

The collections department is an extremely results-oriented group; cash must be
collected or the department is not doing its job. Any form of monitoring system
that does not focus on this effort is not targeting the correct issue.

A possible approach is to publicly post the collection results by collector
within the department. This should be some sort of proportional measure, such as
the percentage of total receivables past due, the percentage of receivables within
different aging categories, or days sales outstanding. Reporting on total accounts
receivable overdue can be misleading, because one collector may have been
assigned a larger dollar volume of accounts receivable than his or her associates.

Calculating this measurement is impossible if collectors are constantly
switched among accounts, so some long-term consistency in account responsibili-
ties is necessary. Also, the collections staff may not initially enjoy having their
performance posted for all to see, so consider turning the issue into a competition,
with small bonus payments based on the best performance.

Creating an accurate bad-debt forecast can be similar to reading tea leaves or

near the forecast. The usual approaches are to either create a forecast based on
specific expected losses or to assign a loss probability based on the age of various
receivables. Neither approach works especially well.

An alternative with a greater level of accuracy involves assigning a risk class
to each customer, and then assigning a loss probability to open receivables based
on the risk class. Risk classifications can be calculated with elaborate in-house risk
scoring systems, but there are many commercially available alternatives available,
such as FICO (Fair, Isaac and Company) scores for individuals or the Dun &
Bradstreet Paydex and Financial Stress scores for businesses.

Here are the steps needed to create a bad-debt forecast based on risk scoring:

1. Periodically obtain new risk scores for all current customers, excluding those
with minimal sales.

2. Load the scores for each customer into an open field in the customer master
file.

3. Print a custom report that sorts current customers in declining order by risk
score.

4. Divide the sorted list into fourths (low risk through high risk), and determine
the bad-debt percentage for the previous year for each category.

5. Use the format in the following example to derive the bad-debt percentage:

7-20 Use Automated Clearing House Debits

In some industries, the invoices sent to customers are exactly the same every
month. This is common in service industries, where there are standard contracts
providing the same services for the same price and for long periods of time.
Examples of such cases are parking lots or health clubs, both of which put their
customers on long-term contracts to pay fixed monthly amounts. In these cases, a
company issues invoices for the same amount every month to all of its customers.
The customers then pay the same amount every month and the accounts receivable


7-21 Lock Access to the Credit-Hold Flag 155

staff enters the same amounts into the accounting software as having been
received.

When the same amount is due every month, a company can use automatic
ACH debits from the bank accounts of customers. This approach eliminates the
need to run any invoices, since the customers do not need them to make a payment.
There are also no collection problems, since payments are automatic. Thus, this
approach can completely eliminate the invoicing and collection steps from the
accounting department.

Before implementing automatic deductions, first review the obstacles that
stand in the way of a successful project. One issue is that some invoices will still be
needed if a company elects to “grandfather” its existing customers so that they do
not have to pay through bank deductions. Another problem is that invoices are also
required for the first month or two of business with a new customer, because it
usually takes some time before the automatic deduction is set up and operating
smoothly. A regular invoice may also be necessary for a new customer because the
first month of service may be for only part of the month (e.g., if the customer starts
at the middle of the month, rather than at the beginning), which is easier to bill
through an invoice than a deduction. Another issue is if the customer’s bank
account is canceled. Though these appear to be a significant number of issues, they
are still a small minority of the total number of transactions processed. Generally
speaking, if a company has a large base of customers for whom there are consistent
and identical billings, a very effective best practice is to convert those customers to
automatic bank deductions.

7-21 Lock Access to the Credit-Hold Flag

In many organizations, the staff has not learned to let the computer system drive
operations. Instead, they have many manual systems built around a basic computer
system (typically containing just accounting and inventory databases), and tend to
consider the information in the computer as simply an aid to their activities, possibly
containing inaccurate information that they must manually correct. In this environ-
ment, the introduction of a credit-hold system through the computer can result in
significant trouble, because the production or shipping staffs may consider a credit-
hold flag to be some sort of system error to be overridden. This problem is especially
difficult when management is driving toward a sales goal and credit holds stand in
their way. An approach that initially appears simple enough is to lock down access to
the credit-hold flag in the computer system. This means that only an authorized
person can put a customer on or remove it from credit-hold status.

The trouble is that a shipping department that is still relying on some manual
systems can easily ignore the hold flag and ship products anyway, especially if
the computer system does not automatically print pick lists or bills of lading.


156 Collections Best Practices

Furthermore, if the credit-hold report is not regularly used or even made available
to the shipping staff, or if it is not integrated into the shipping system, locking
down the hold flag will serve no practical purpose. Thus, you must incorporate
additional controls into a shipping system in order to make restricted access to the
hold flag work as intended.

7-22 Maintain Customer Orders Database

If a customer has a large open order with a company, it is likely that the customer
will be quite responsive to pressure to pay for open invoices when those orders are
put on hold. Consequently, an excellent best practice to implement is to give the
collections staff current knowledge of all open orders.

Implementation of this practice is an easy one for most companies; just give
password access to the existing customer orders database to the collections staff.
This access can be read-only, so there is no danger of a staff person’s inadvertently
changing key information in a customer order. An additional issue is that someone
must be responsible for flagging customers as “do not ship” in the customer orders
database. This is a necessary step since orders will inadvertently pass through the
system if there is not a solid block in the computer on shipments to a delinquent
customer. However, many companies are uncomfortable with allowing the
collections staff to have free access to altering the shipment status of customers,
since they may use it so much that customers become irritated. Consequently, it
may be better to allow this access only to a supervisor, such as an assistant
controller, who can review a proposed order-hold request with the sales staff to see
what the impact will be on customer relations before actually imposing it.

In summary, giving the collections staff access to the open orders database for
customers results in better leverage over delinquent customers by threatening to
freeze existing orders unless payment is made. The use of this database should be
tempered by a consideration for long-term relations with customers; it should only be
used if there is a clear collections problem that cannot be resolved in some other way.

7-23 Subscribe to Special Event Notifications

The collections department can be completely blindsided by a sudden drop in the
credit rating of a customer, possibly resulting in bankruptcy and the loss of all
accounts receivable to that customer. Though a company can track payment
histories over time, talk to other suppliers of a customer, or periodically purchase
credit records from a credit analysis group, all of these options require a continual
planned effort. Many collections departments do not have the time to complete


7-24 Set Up Automatic Fax of Overdue Invoices 157

these extra tasks, even though the cost of being blindsided can be very high. They
just take the chance that customers will continue to be financially stable.

Rather than undergo the embarrassment of losing an account receivable
through the sudden decline of a customer, it is better to arrange for automatic
notification of any significant changes to the credit standing of a customer. To do
this, a company can contract with a major credit rating agency, such as Dun &
Bradstreet. This organization can e-mail a notification of any changes to the status
of a customer, such as a change in the speed of its payment, adverse legal
judgments, or strikes, which may signal a decline in the customer’s ability to pay
its bills. With this information in hand, a credit manager can take immediate steps
to shrink a customer’s credit limit and put extra emphasis on collection efforts for
all outstanding accounts receivable, thereby avoiding problems later on, when a
customer may sink into bankruptcy. The credit manager can be especially effective
in taking action if several triggering events have occurred over a short period of
time, indicating a steep decline in a customer’s financial condition.

The only problem with advance notification of a customer’s credit standing is
that the credit agency will charge a fee for its work. However, the price of the
notification, usually in the range of $25 to $40, is minor compared to the potential
loss of existing accounts receivable. The only case where a company would not
want to have advance notification set up is for customers that rarely make orders
and usually of a small size when they do; in this case, a small credit limit is
adequate protection against any major bad-debt losses.

7-24 Set Up Automatic Fax of Overdue Invoices

The most common request that a collections person receives from a customer is to
send a copy of an invoice that the customer cannot find. To do so, the collections
person must either access the accounting computer system to print out a copy of the
invoice or go to the customer’s file to find it. Then the collections person must
create a cover letter and fax it and the invoice to the customer. In addition, the fax
may not go through, in which case the collections person must repeat this process.
This process is typically the longest of all collections tasks—a collection call may
only take a few minutes, but faxing an invoice can take several times that amount.

Few companies have found a way around the faxing problem. Those that have
done so automatically extract an invoice record from the accounting database and fax
it to the customer—all at the touch of a button. To do so, a company must link the
invoice file in the accounting database to another file containing the name and fax
number of the recipient, combine these two files to create a cover letter and invoice,
and route the two records to a fax server for automatic transmission, one that will
keep transmitting until the fax goes through, and then notify the sender of successful
or failed transmissions. The advantages of this approach are obvious: immediate


158 Collections Best Practices

turnaround time, no need for the collections person to move to complete a fax, and
automatic notification if there is a problem in completing a fax. For a company witha
large collections staff, this represents a monumental improvement in efficiency.

The trouble with setting up an automatic invoice-faxing system is that you
must put together several functions that are not normally combined. This almost
certainly calls for customized programming and may have a risk that the system
will periodically fail, due to the complex interlinking of different systems. To give
a picture of the complexity of this approach, the front end of the system must
include an input screen for the collections person that allows entry of the
customer’s contact name and fax number, as well as any accompanying text
that should go on the cover letter to accompany the faxed invoice. On the same
screen, you should be able to enter an invoice number so that the software
automatically searches the invoice file and selects the correct invoice. There may
be an additional step at this point, where the system presents a text image of the
invoice so the collections person can verify that the correct invoice is about to be
transmitted. Next, both the invoice text and the information that goes on the cover
letter must be converted to a digital image that can be transmitted by fax. After that,
the images are transmitted to a server that is a stand-alone fax transmission device.
The server will repeatedly fax out the images to the recipient for a fixed number of
attempts. If the transmission is not successful, the fax server will notify the sender
via an e-mail message (which requires a preexisting email system); conversely, it
should also send a message indicating a successful transmission.

Obviously, it is a difficult task to combine the accounting database with a fax
server and an e-mail system and expect it all to work properly at all times. Common
problems are that information will not be successfully transmitted between the
various components of the system, resulting in no fax transmission, or that the
e-mail notification system does not work, resulting in no messages to the collections
staff, who have no idea if their faxes are being sent or not. Consequently, most
companies with small collections staff do not deem it worth the effort to attempt such
an installation. Only the largest corporations, with correspondingly large collections
staffs, use this best practice.

7-25 Issue Dunning Letters Automatically

Some companies have so many small accounts to collect that they cannot possibly
take the time to call all of them to resolve payment disputes. This is an especially
common problem for very small accounts receivable, where the cost of a contact
call may exceed the amount of revenue outstanding. In other cases, there is some
difficulty in contacting customers by phone, usually because all collection calls are
automatically routed to the voice mail of the accounts payable departments. In
these cases, a different form of communication is needed.


7-25 Issue Dunning Letters Automatically 159

The best way to contact either unresponsive customers or accounts with very
small overdue balances is the dunning letter. This is a letter that lists the overdue
amount, the invoice number, and date, and requests payment. There are normally
several degrees of severity in the tone of the dunning letter; the initial one has a
respectful tone, assuming that there has been some mistake resulting in non-
payment. There is a gradual increase in severity. The final letter is the most
threatening and usually requires immediate payment within a specific number of
days or else the account will be turned over to a collection agency, the customer
will be converted to cash-on-delivery for all future sales, or some similar dire
warning. As it is impossible to craft a separate dunning letter for every customer
situation (given the cost of doing so), a collections department must create a
standard set of dunning letters that can be used for all customers. Though an
informal way of communicating, a form letter still gets the point across to the
customer. There is also a standard time interval between the issuance of each in a
series of dunning letters—perhaps two weeks past the initial invoice due date
before the first letter is sent, with additional letters being sent every two weeks
thereafter. This use of a series of dunning letters, issued at standard intervals, is an
effective and low-cost way to reach customers with whom it is not cost effective or
otherwise possible to communicate.

There are various degrees of automation that can be applied to the use of
dunning letters. The easiest approach is to have a standard preprinted letter,
easily copied and mailed to a customer. The next level of automation is to store
standard letters in a computer network, where all collections personnel can
access them and make small modifications to match the customers to whom they
are being sent. Though simple, both of these approaches suffer from the same
complaint—there is no way to automatically issue dunning letters at set
intervals. Instead, one must rely on the collections staff to remember to send
out the letters. A more automated approach that takes into account the time
interval since the last letter is merging the dunning letters into the accounting
software. To do so, some custom programming is required. The programming
must automatically access a text file as soon as an invoice reaches a certain
number of days past due and issue a dunning letter. A different text file must be
accessed as the number of days past due increases, since more strident letters
must be sent as the invoices become older. The letters can then be printed and
mailed out each day in a batch. Though this last method provides the tightest
control over the standard issuance of the correct kinds of dunning letters, it is
more complicated to set up, so it is generally best to calculate the programming
cost of making such a significant enhancement before proceeding.

The automatic issuance of dunning letters is a cost-effective method for
establishing a continual communication with customers regarding overdue invoices.
It is particularly suitable to those situations where it is impossible to create personal
relationships with customers through more expensive collection calls.

7-26 Automate E-Mail Delivery of Overdue Invoice Information

The process of engaging in a dispute with a customer over an overdue invoice
payment usually requires a number of steps, where the two parties eventually
establish the reason for nonpayment and then exchange information supporting
their sides of the dispute.

A company can clear away most of its side of this paperwork if it is willing to
create a system that automatically assembles a standard set of documents and
e-mails them to the primary customer contact. This approach can save a great deal
of time by the collections staff, which would otherwise need to accumulate it
manually, and does so on a fixed schedule so that the information is issued as soon
as a receivable payment is overdue.

Creating such a system requires a considerable amount of work. It must extract
a copy of the invoice from the accounting system, the customer’s original order
from the order-entry system, the proof of delivery from the warehouse manage-
ment system, and possibly even a copy of the master pricing contract from the
purchasing system—and then assemble it into a PDF-formatted package for e-mail
transmission. Given the considerable cost of this system, a company must have a
large collections group that will save a large proportion of its time by having this
level of automation installed. A lower-cost alternative is to incrementally add
information from more company systems over time, gaining feedback from the
collections staff to see what other information should be added that will assist in the
collection effort.

7-27 Usea Collection Call Database

A poorly organized collections group is one that does not know which customers to
call, what customers said during previous calls, and how frequently contacts
should be made in the future. The result of this level of disorganization is overdue
payments being ignored for long periods, other customers being contacted so
frequently that they become annoyed, and continually duplicated efforts. To a large
extent, these problems can be overcome by using a collection call database.

A typical collection call database is a simple one recorded on paper, or a
complex one that is integrated into a company’s accounting software package. In
either case, the basic concept is the same—keep a record of all contacts with the
customer, as well as when to contact the customer next and what other actions to
take. The first part of the database, the key contact listing, should contain the
following information:

¢ Customer name

¢ Key contact name


7-27 Use a Collection Call Database 161

¢ Secondary contact name
¢ Internal salesperson’s name with account responsibility
¢ Phone numbers of all contacts

¢ Fax numbers of all contacts
The contact log comprises the second part of the database and should contain:

¢ Date of contact
¢ Name of person contacted
¢ Topics discussed

¢ Action items

The information noted is easily kept in a notebook if there is a single
collections person, but may require a more complex, centralized database if there
are many collections personnel. In the latter case, a supervisor may need to monitor
collections activities for all employees, and he or she can do this more easily if the
data are stored in a single location. However, a notebook-based database can be set
up in a few hours with minimal effort, whereas a computerized database, especially
one that is closely linked to the accounting records for each account receivable,
may be a major undertaking. The reason for the added effort (and expense) is that it
may be necessary to custom-program extra text fields into the accounting software
so that notations can be kept alongside the record for each invoice; this is a
surprisingly difficult endeavor, given the number of changes that must be made to
the underlying database. The most difficult situation of all is if a company uses a
software package that is regularly updated by a software supplier. Any changes
made to the software (such as adding text fields) will be destroyed as soon as the
next upgrade is installed, since the upgrade will wipe out all changes made in the
interim.

A good midway approach for avoiding these difficulties with a computerized
database is to use a separate tracking system not linked to the accounting software.
Such software packages are commonly used by the sales department to track
contacts with customers and can be easily modified to work for a collections
department. They can be modified for use by multiple employees, resulting in a
central database of contact information easily perused by a collections manager.
The only problem with this approach is that there is no linkage between the
customer contact information contained in the accounting software (e.g., names
and addresses) and the same information in the tracking software. This contact
information must be reloaded manually from the accounting software into the
tracking software. Likewise, any change to the contact information in the tracking
software must be manually updated in the accounting system. Despite its limita-
tions, maintaining a separate tracking system in the computer is an inexpensive
way to maintain a centralized contact database.

7-28 Access Up-to-Date Collection Agency Information

Most companies have an in-house collection system in place, which they use to
track the status of collection efforts on overdue invoices. This approach works
fine until the in-house collections staff forwards receivables to third-party
collection agencies for more aggressive collection efforts. At this point, the
company has no way to update its receivable information, short of calling each
agency and manually updating information about each invoice. Though this
solution may be sufficient for companies with a small volume of outsourced
collection work, a more automated solution is needed for higher-volume entities.
Here are some solutions that improve the flow of collections information back to
the company:

¢ Allow collection agencies online access to the corporate collections data-
base. Though this approach does result in the use of a single corporate
database, as well as no need for additional staff data entry, it also presents
several problems. First, collection agencies may obtain access to the com-
pany’s entire receivables database, including information about other receiv-
ables and collection agencies. Also, the company must provide training to the
collection agency, and also runs the risk that any data entered will be
inaccurate. Further, because of the company’s training investment, it will
be more likely to use only a few collection agencies, rather than trying out new
ones.

¢ Obtain online access to collection agency databases. This approach creates
more labor for the company, which must extract data from collection agency
systems and manually update its own database with this information. This
approach also requires a learning curve, which will force the company to use a
very small number of collection agencies in order to learn fewer systems.

¢ Manage your own hosting service. A company doing a sufficient amount of
business with collection agencies can use a variation of the last bullet point,
and create its own Web-based hosting service. By doing so, it makes selected
collection data available on the Internet to its collection agencies, and provides
them with data-entry screens that they use to update collection status—which
is then ported back into the company’s collections database.

The last approach is the ideal one, but only for larger companies. The relevant
solution will be the one most cost-effective to a company, given the volume of its
collection activity and the nature of its in-house collection systems and technical
support.

7-29 Implement Customer Order Exception Tracking System 163

7-29 Implement Customer Order Exception Tracking System

Many of the problems that result in collections work begin much earlier, from the
time an order is entered into the system to the time it is produced, shipped, and
invoiced. This interval is not one that the collections staff has any direct control
over (unless the collections manager happens to run the entire company!), which
means that problems upstream from the collections department will nonetheless
have a direct and continuing impact on the quantity and type of problems that the
collections staff must handle.

A good best practice for rooting out problems before they become collection
issues is to set up a reporting system to track exceptions for customer orders as they
move through all of a company’s various processes. By keeping close tabs on these
reports, the manager of the collection function can tell when there will probably be
collection difficulties. By determining problems with specific customer orders in
advance, the collections manager can work with the managers of other departments
(mostly by suggestion) to correct problems before orders are shipped. A crucial
factor in the success of this best practice is the interpersonal skill of the collections
manager, who must bring customer order exceptions to the attention of other
managers in such a way that they will not reactive negatively, but rather work with
the presented information to make prompt corrections to their systems.

Another use of the reports is to recognize which orders are likely to result in
collection problems and to use this information to make collection calls earlier than
normal so that any customer problems can be discovered, addressed, and resolved
before the associated accounts receivable become inordinately old. By using the
exception reports to manage accounts receivable more closely, it is possible to
maintain a high accounts receivable turnover ratio, which frees up working capital
for other purposes.

The number of reports used to track customer order exceptions will vary
dramatically, depending on the types of systems already in place, the services or
products offered to customers, and the type of industry. This range of options
makes a complete list of all exception reports impossible to present, but the
following list is a representative sample of the types of information that a
collections manager should consider using as the foundation of a comprehensive
order exception tracking system:

 

¢ Customer orders with nonstandard prices.
¢ Customer orders for which the delivery date has exceeded the requested date.

¢ Customer orders for which the quantity on hand is less than the amount
ordered.

¢ Customer orders for which the scheduled production is later than the requested
delivery date.

¢ Customer orders for which partial deliveries have been sent.


164 Collections Best Practices

¢ Customer orders requiring special-order parts.
* Customer orders requiring a special form of transportation.

* Customer orders requiring a special form of packaging.

All of these exception reports focus on nonstandard customer orders, or orders
for which there is some kind of shortfall. They are a very effective tool for honing
in on those orders for which there will probably be customer complaints, which
may result in collection problems.

The ability of a collections manager to create all these reports will depend on
the type of computer database used to collect data about customer orders. Also,
there should be a good report-writing tool or a willing programming staff to assist
in the creation of these reports. If these factors are in place, a collections
department can benefit greatly from an advance knowledge of which customer
orders are likely to result in collection problems.

7-30 Install a Dispute Tracking System

Customers usually deduct payment amounts from invoices they owe because of
problems caused by the originating company. Examples of these problems are
product returns caused by faulty products or incorrect order processing, product
damage due to incorrect shipment packaging, incorrect sales deals issued by sales
personnel, and promotional or advertising deductions for deals that were not
clearly specified by the marketing staff. Unfortunately, none of the staff in these
areas in which the problems originated are likely to hear about the resulting
collection problems, because the collection task is placed in the hands of a clerk, in
either the accounting or treasury departments, who is thoroughly overworked, and
who certainly has neither the tools nor the authority to drive corrective changes
back through the organization.

The solution is to give this person the tools to do so, which can then be
accessed by a high-enough level of manager to ensure that corrective actions are
taken. A properly functioning deduction investigation system requires workflow
software in which one can route information about the problem to the appropriate
party. The software must be able to shift the action routing to different parties if
action is not taken by predetermined dates, thereby ensuring that action is taken to
correct deduction-related problems. A key part of the dispute tracking system is the
reason code assigned to each dispute. The list of available reason codes should be
carefully defined, standardized, and kept to a relatively short list. Although this
issue may appear simple enough, it is extremely difficult to aggregate dispute
information if the same types of disputes are identified using different reason
codes. If a workflow management system routes disputes to different people based
on assigned reason codes, then it is quite possible for disputes to be routed to the


7-31 Report on Ongoing Customer Complaints 165

wrong person. The system must also allow you to review the linked electronic
images of related documentation associated with the specific problem, which calls
for a document digitizing system. Further, the system must periodically summarize
the various issues causing deductions to be taken, and route this information to the
senior management team, where they can spot emerging problems and ensure that
they are resolved.

Finally, an implementing company must have a central database for its various
functional areas, such as is provided by an enterprise resource planning (ERP)
system so that all parties can have ready access to the various stores of information
throughout the company that relate to the issue at hand. Clearly, these requirements
are expensive, but they give you the opportunity to continually monitor the reasons
for deductions and fix the underlying problems causing them. This capability is
invaluable not only from the perspective of improving customer relations but also
because it reduces the ongoing cost of dealing with payment deductions.

A crucial result of a dispute tracking system is the identification of repeat
offenders. These are the companies that always find a reason (or no reason at all) to
dispute payments, thereby delaying their payments to the company. With a dispute
tracking system in place, management can determine the average aggregate
amount of disputed items outstanding with each repeat offender, estimate the
in-house cost of dealing with these disputes, and then decide if it is still profitable to
continue doing business with these customers or if it would be better to prune them
out of the accepted customer list.

7-31 Report on Ongoing Customer Complaints

Some customers deliberately issue a series of complaints about an order, with the
sole intention of extracting concessions from the company in the form of payment
deductions, late payments, and product upgrades. Such a customer initially appears
to be profitable, based on the standard profit on the products ordered. However,
when the cost of employee time, deductions, and delayed payments are netted
against the initial profit, transactions with these customers frequently end up being
a loss.

The collections staff is probably well aware of these customers, since they
must deal with them constantly. However, management does not deal with
customers on a daily basis, and so needs a reporting system that can reliably
pinpoint who is causing problems on an ongoing basis. They can then use this
information to determine when the company should stop doing business with
selected customers.

The reporting system should compile a customer complaints score based on
the number of problems accumulated by the customer, in the form of such factors
as deductions taken, calls recorded in the customer service database, and average

days to pay. The report should accumulate this information over the recent past,
such as the past three months or six months, and present customer scores in
declining order, so the worst customers are listed at the top of the report.

If this reporting structure is too difficult to assemble, then at least manually
summarize the various types of problems for the small subset of customers causing
the most trouble and present it on a trend line. The use of a trend line is important,
since it will highlight those customers who are continually causing problems,
rather than those who have had legitimate issues with a single order.

7-32 Link to Comprehensive Collections Software Package

Many of the other system-related best practices noted in this chapter are based on
the assumption that a company wants to incrementally create separate applications
that are directly linked to an existing accounting computer system. If so, a fair
amount of programming work will be required to arrive at a complete in-house
solution. This can be both expensive and time consuming. For those who prefer to
install a complete solution on a more rapid time schedule, it is also possible to
purchase a software package that incorporates many of the system-related best
practices for collections.

An example of this breed of software is Sungard’s GetPAID. This product is
linked to a company’s legacy accounting systems (specifically, the open accounts
receivable and customer files) by customized interfaces, so there is either a
continual or batched flow of information into it. A key feature it offers is the
assignment of each customer to a specific collections person so that each person
can call up a subset of the overdue invoices for which he or she is responsible.
Within this subset, the software will also categorize accounts in different sort
sequences, such as placing those at the top that have missed their promised
payment dates. Also, the software will present on a single screen all of the contact
information related to each customer, including the promises made by customers,
open issues, and contact information. The system will also allow the user to enter
information for a fax, and then route it directly to the recipient, without requiring
the collections person to ever leave his or her chair. It can also be linked to an auto-
dialer so that the collections staff spends less time attempting to establish
connections with overdue customers. To further increase the efficiency of the
collections staff, it will even determine the time zone in which each customer is
located and prioritize the recommended list of calls so that only those customers in
time zones that are currently in the midst of standard business hours will be called.

The GetPAID system does not just store collections data—it can also export it
to other systems, where it can be altered for other uses or reformatted for
management reporting purposes (though the package contains its own reporting
features, as well). Some of the standard reports include a time-series report on


7-33 Use Real-Time Cash Application Techniques 167

performance of individual collection personnel, as well as the same information for
each customer. It can also create reports that are tailored by recipient—for
example, all of the collection problems for a specific salesperson’s customers
can be lumped into one report and sent to that salesperson for remedial action.
Finally, the system allows customers to log in so they can upload payment dates
into the system and resolve disputes online.

Several collection software packages of this type are Web-based, so there is no
local software installation at all. Instead, users can log into a Web site. This
approach eliminates all local information technology (IT) support and also makes it
easier to roll out the package to new locations.

There are several cost issues to consider when installing this type of soft-
ware—not only of the software itself but also for staff training time, installation by
consultants, and ongoing maintenance costs. Offsetting these problems is a much
shorter time period before a company will have an advanced collections software
system fully operational. The record time period for a GetPAID installation is just
five days, though a more typical installation speed is 60 days. For those companies
with a serious collections problem and that need help right away, a comprehensive
collections software package may be the answer.

7-33 Use Real-Time Cash Application Techniques

There are few things more annoying for the collections staff than to waste time
contacting a customer about an “overdue” payment, only to find that they have not
only already paid but the company has already cashed the check! Here are three
ways to ensure that incoming cash receipts are properly applied to accounts
receivable as fast as possible, so the collections staff will not experience this
problem:

¢ Review the unapplied cash account every day. When the cash application
staff does not know how to apply a check, it usually drops it into an unapplied
cash account, with the intent of researching it further when there is time.
However, it may be a long time before the staff gets around to the research
work. To keep this delay from occurring, assign an experienced senior clerk to
the job of clearing out the unapplied cash account every day, and have a
manager inquire about the status of all items in the account on a regular basis.
Also, do not evaluate the performance of the cash application staff based on
how fast they can apply cash—this just drives them to dump more difficult
items into the unapplied cash account.

¢ Review the bank account every day. Many customers now use Automated
Clearing House (ACH) payments instead of checks, so review the bank
account first thing each morning to see what has arrived. Don’t wait for the


168 Collections Best Practices

bank statement to arrive at month-end to conduct this review, since customer
payments may have been languishing in the account for up to a month.

¢ Review lockbox online. If the bank handling your lockbox posts check
images online, then treat it just like a daily bank account review—don’t wait a
couple of extra days for customer payment information to arrive by mail.

Summary

The job of collecting accounts receivables is a hard and thankless one. The person
who performs well in this position is the one who finds out why a customer pays
late and then works with other departments to ensure that the customer has fewer
reasons for doing so in the future. This approach is embodied by many of the best
practices presented in this chapter, such as simplifying the pricing structure and
examining customer orders to see if there are any shipment problems. It is also
important for a good collections person to keep accounts receivable from
becoming overdue in the first place. Some of the best practices in this chapter
address this issue, such as granting early payment discount terms and immediately
applying all cash as soon as it is received. Another part of the collections job is to
perform collection calls as efficiently as possible; this task is addressed by other
best practices, such as using automated faxes of overdue invoices and dunning
letters, as well as a collection call database. Finally, the collections staff must use
all possible pressure points to collect from customers, which it can do with the use
of collection call stratification and a database of customer assets. When all of
these tools are properly utilized, a collections staff not only can perform its job
more efficiently but can reduce significantly the amount of overdue accounts
receivable at the same time.

Credit Best Practices

In a surprising number of companies, there is no credit function at all. Instead, the
standard practice is to invoice all and sundry and hope that they pay approximately
on time. Only when a company accumulates a few large bad-debt losses does
management finally take action and institute credit analysis for its customers.
However, the initial foray into credit analysis tends to be understaffed and poorly
funded, with only cursory customer analysis; bad losses are only avoided by good
luck, rather than through detailed analysis. It is only after management approves
the formation of a well-run and fully funded credit department that the imposition
of a comprehensive set of operating policies and procedures will achieve a
reduction in bad-debt losses.

This chapter provides many best practices that a credit department can use to
tighten or ease its credit policy to meet varying circumstances, as well as provide
access to more useful customer credit information and tools for extending credit
with the minimum of risk to the company. When integrated into a solid set of
policies and procedures, the credit department can become surprisingly effective.

Implementation Issues for Credit Best Practices

Exhibit 8.1 shows that nearly all of the credit best practices involve a minimal
amount of funding and very little time to implement. The key issue with credit best
practices implementation, therefore, is not based on having sufficient resources
available. Instead, the key factor is the willingness of the management team to
impose a sufficient level of credit controls to reduce bad-debt losses. In many
companies whose orientation is strictly customer focused, this can be a hard
decision to reach. Instead, there is a tendency toward minimal credit practices,
which results in less imposition on customers but higher levels of bad-debt losses.

8-1 Create a Credit Policy 171

8-1 Create a Credit Policy

One of the chief causes of confusion not only within the credit department but
also between the credit and sales departments is the lack of consistency in
dealing with customer credit issues. This includes who is responsible for credit
tasks, what logical structure is used to evaluate and assign credit, what terms of
sale are used, and what milestones are established for the collections process.
Without consistent application of these items, customers never know what credit
levels they are likely to be assigned, collections activities tend to jolt from one
step to the next in no predetermined order, and no one knows who is responsible
for what activities.

Establishment of a reasonably detailed credit policy goes a long way toward
resolving these issues. A well-written credit policy should clearly state the mission
and goals of the credit department, exactly which positions are responsible for the
most critical credit and collections tasks, what formula shall be used for assigning
credit levels, and what steps shall be followed in the collections process (though a
true collections maestro might balk at the thought of using a boringly consistent
methodology!). Further comments are as follows:

¢ Mission. The mission statement should outline the general concept of how the
credit department does business—does it provide a loose credit policy to
maximize sales, or work toward high-quality receivables (implying reduced
sales), or manage credit at some point in between? A loose credit policy might
result in this mission: “The credit department shall offer credit to all customers
except those where the risk of loss is probable.”

¢ Goals. This can be quite specific, describing the exact performance measure-
ments against which the credit staff will be judged. For example, “The
department goals are to operate with no more than one collections person
per 1,000 customers, while attaining a bad-debt percentage no higher than
2 percent of sales, and annual days’ sales outstanding of no higher than
42 days.”

¢ Responsibilities. This is perhaps the most critical part of the policy, based on
the number of quarrels it can avert. It should firmly state who has final
authority over the granting of credit and the assignment of credit-hold status.
This is normally the credit manager, but the policy can also state the order
volume level at which someone else, such as the chief financial officer (CFO)
or treasurer, can be called on to render final judgment.

¢ Credit-level assignment. This section may be of extreme interest to the sales
staff, the size of whose sales (and commissions) are based on it. The policy
should at least state the sources of information to be used in the calculation of a
credit limit, such as credit reports or financial statements, and can also include
the minimum credit level automatically extended to all customers, as well as
the criteria used to grant larger limits.


172 Credit Best Practices

¢ Collections methodology. The policy can itemize what collection steps shall
be followed, such as initial calls, customer visits, e-mails, notification of the
sales staff, credit holds, and forwarding to a collections agency. This section
can be written in too much detail, itemizing exactly what steps are to be taken
after a certain number of days. This can constrain an active collections staff
from taking unique steps to achieve a collection, so a certain degree of
vagueness is acceptable here.

¢ Terms of sale. If there are few product lines in a single industry, it is useful to
clearly state a standard payment term, such as a | percent discount if paid in 10
days; otherwise, full payment is expected in 30 days. An override policy can
be included, noting a sign-off by the controller. By doing so, the sales staff will
be less inclined to attempt to gain better terms on behalf of customers.
However, where there are multiple industries served with different customary
credit terms, it may be too complicated to include this verbiage in the credit
policy.

8-2 Modify the Credit Policy Based on Product Margins

Company management can cause significant losses if it attempts to loosen the
corporate credit policy without a good knowledge of the margins it earns on its
products. For example, if it earns only a 10 percent profit on a product that sells for
$10 and extends credit for one unit on that product to a customer who defaults, it
has just incurred a loss of $9 that will require the sale of nine more units to offset
the loss. However, if the same product had a profit of 50 percent, it would require
the sale of only one more unit to offset the loss on a bad debt. Thus, loosening or
tightening the credit policy can have a dramatic impact on profits when product
margins are low.

The obvious solution is to review product margins with management on a
regular basis, whenever management wants to alter the credit policy, or when new
products are about to be released. The concept can be taken a step further by
altering the credit policy for each product family, so the credit limit is more closely
aligned with product profit levels. This approach allows you to fine-tune credit
policy to maximize profits. At its most advanced level, consider the credit policy in
advance for products that are still in the design stage. If a company is using target
costing to more precisely define product costs during the design stage, this can be
an effective approach for linking credit policy with the product rollout to achieve
maximum profitability upon product release.

8-4 Modify the Credit Policy Based on Potential Product Obsolescence 173

8-3 Modify the Credit Policy Based on Changing
Economic Conditions

When economic conditions within an industry worsen, a company whose credit
policy has not changed from a more expansive period will likely find itself granting
more credit than it should, resulting in more bad debts. Similarly, a restrictive
credit policy during a boom period will result in lost sales that go to competitors.
This latter approach is particularly galling over the long term, since customers may
permanently convert to a competitor and not come back, resulting in lost market
share.

The solution is to schedule a periodic review of the credit policy with senior
management to see when it should be changed to match economic conditions. A
scheduled quarterly review is generally sufficient for this purpose. To prepare for
the meeting, assemble a list of leading indicators for the industry, tracked on a trend
line, that show where the business cycle is most likely to be heading. This
information is most relevant for the company’s industry, rather than the economy
as a whole, since the conditions within some industries can vary substantially from
the general economy. If a company has international operations, then the credit
policy can be tailored to suit the business cycles of specific countries.

8-4 Modify the Credit Policy Based on Potential
Product Obsolescence

If a company manufactures or resells products with a short shelf life, or that are
subject to rapid technological obsolescence or fashion trends, completed products
sitting in the warehouse may be subject to obsolescence in the very short term. If
so, a tight credit policy can result in limited product sales that leave excess
quantities on hand. In such cases, the company is faced with the choice of
scrapping the remaining inventory or selling it off at fire sale prices.

The alternative is to loosen the credit policy on those selected inventory items
most likely to become obsolete in the near term. The logic is that, even if inventory
is sold to customers with a questionable ability to pay for the goods, this at least
presents higher odds of obtaining payment than if the company trucks the goods to
the nearest dumpster.

To make this best practice work, the credit department must be kept regularly
informed of the obsolescence status of inventory items, preferably on a daily or
weekly basis. The easiest way to do this is to have the sales, marketing, and
logistics staffs regularly flag potentially obsolete items in the inventory database
and give the credit department online access to this information. When customers
send in orders, the credit staff can call up this information in the computer system,
verify the obsolescence status of the items ordered, and modify the credit policy as


174 Credit Best Practices

needed. If the company also has a credit scoring system, it should consider linking
this data feed from the inventory database into the scoring model, so the model
automatically issues different credit recommendations based on the items being
ordered.

8-5 Centralize Credit Risk Analysis

Credit risk analysis is frequently managed at the business unit level. A credit
manager decides on the appropriate level of risk that the business unit wants to
accept by investing in receivables from a specific customer, and manages the
customer’s orders to that level. However, what if there are a number of similar
business units within a company, and the same customer is doing business with
several of them? This means that the company’s exposure in aggregate is
considerably higher than the maximum level allowed by the credit managers in
each business unit. If the customer were to go bankrupt, the entire company might
suddenly find itself facing a much larger loss than anyone had previously
suspected.

There are two ways to handle this problem. One approach is to centralize
credit risk analysis so that a single credit group can see the aggregated total credit
level for each customer. This approach works best if the same accounting system is
used throughout a company, which makes it easier to aggregate information
relevant to the credit decision. However, it will face resistance from the local
business unit managers who prefer to run their own credit operations. A less
intrusive alternative is to have a corporate-level analyst periodically aggregate
receivable balances and credit limits by customer for all business units, and then
flag those customers doing a significant amount of business with the company as a
whole. The corporate controller can bring potential credit problems to the attention
of the business unit controllers and come to a mutual agreement regarding credit
reductions.

8-6 Preapprove Customer Credit

The collections staff suffers severely from credit that is granted after the sales force
makes a sale to a customer. The typical situation is that a salesperson finds a new
customer and makes an inordinately large sale to it; the salesperson then badgers
the credit department to grant a large credit limit to the customer since there is a
large commission on the line. The credit staff yields to this pressure and allows
more credit than the supplier’s credit history warrants, resulting in a difficult


8-7 Subscribe to a Credit Report Database 175

collection job for the collections staff. The answer to this quandary lies in fixing the
credit-granting process well before the collections staff even knows the new
customer exists.

The solution is to work closely with the sales staff to create a “hit list” of new
customer prospects before any sales effort is made to contact them. The credit staff
then reviews existing credit information about these customers, which is easily
gleaned from credit reporting agencies, and calculates the credit levels that it is
comfortable granting. These credit levels are given to the sales staff, which now
knows the upper limits of what it is allowed to sell to each customer. This approach
greatly reduces the pressure that salespeople are wont to bring on the credit staff for
higher credit limits. A major by-product of this process is that the collections staff
no longer has to deal with inordinately high accounts receivable with customers
who have no way of paying on time.

The only problem with this approach is that a great deal of intradepartmental
discipline is needed. The sales manager, in particular, must be able to carefully plan
in advance for upcoming sales campaigns and control the sales staff in following
sales targets. In addition, this person must see the importance of setting up credit
levels in advance and be able to work closely with the credit department in granting
appropriate credit levels. If this type of person is not running the sales department,
it will be difficult to enforce this best practice.

One way to gain the cooperation of the sales manager is to run a cost-benefit
analysis that compares the cost of credit prescreening to the resulting reduction in
marketing costs. If the accounting manager can show that a company failing the
prescreen can then be excluded from all marketing mailing lists, the marketing
budget will benefit from reductions in expensive mailings and follow-up contacts.
The sales manager may find that this represents a significant cost reduction, and
will then support the prescreening concept. To achieve these cost reductions, this
approach requires that prescreen failures be retained in a separate file, which is then
subtracted from the marketing database.

Thus, planning carefully to grant appropriate levels of credit to customers
before the sales force contacts them is an excellent way to reduce the number of
customers the collections staff must contact.

8-7 Subscribe to a Credit Report Database

When a customer calls to place an order on credit, the credit department is
operating from a clean slate. It has no idea whether the information the customer
enters into a credit application is correct. Although a painstaking amount of labor
can eventually verify this information, a large time penalty is required to do so.
Meanwhile, customers must wait for the application to be completed, which may
take days, sending frustrated customers elsewhere.


176 Credit Best Practices

One solution is to download credit reports on customers over the Internet.
These reports list company locations, names, officer information, credit histories,
legal problems, banking relations, financial information, and other data of great use
to the credit department. The largest purveyors of these reports are Dun &
Bradstreet (www.dnb.com) and Equifax (www.equifax.com). There are also a
number of reporting services that specialize in credit reports by industry: the
equipment leasing, food, home furnishings, manufacturing, and plastics industries
are served in this manner.

It is easiest to buy a subscription to these reports, which considerably reduces
the price per report. Lower-cost reports include only basic customer information,
such as corporate names, locations, ownership, and corporate history, whereas the
more expensive reports include a variety of financial and payment information.
Equifax reports present information more graphically, but the two report providers
issue essentially the same information.

Ifa small business has just a few owners, it is entirely possible that the finances
of the business and the owners are intertwined, either because the owners rely on
their businesses for the bulk of their personal income or because they are willing to
use personal resources to shore up a failing company. Thus, if the finances of an
owner begin to decline, this is a strong leading indicator that the finances of the
business will begin to decline soon thereafter. Accordingly, the periodic review of
owners’ personal credit reports can be an exceedingly useful tool in evaluating the
credit of smaller businesses. The periodic review of the credit reports of both small
businesses and their owners at the same time provides the best possible early
warning system for credit problems.

The cost of these reports can build up rapidly if many customers require a
review, so the credit manager should use some discretion in determining what
credit level requires the use of a credit report.

8-8 Create an Internal Credit Scoring System

When a company becomes large enough to have a large customer base, a key
concern is the development of a reliable credit-scoring model to determine which
customers should be granted or denied credit. Though adequate credit-scoring
systems are available from third parties, larger firms can potentially save
millions of dollars by creating credit solutions that are fine-tuned to their
specific needs, especially because internal data about customers provide a
much more powerful predictor of customer risk than a model based on just
the information provided by an external credit report agency. Ultimately, an
internal credit-scoring system allows a company to avoid the maximum number
of bad debts, while lowering the rejection rate on accounts that will not become
bad debts. It can also lead to the adjustment of existing credit limits to reflect


8-8 Create an Internal Credit Scoring System 177

each customer’s underlying credit quality. There are four basic types of credit-
scoring systems:

1. Rules-based. Creates a score based on a set of rules constructed from
the company’s past experience. However, the weights assigned to the
various scoring factors are highly judgmental and may not improve
scoring results.

2. Neural network-based. Uses artificial intelligence algorithms to find
relationships between account characteristics and the probability of default.
However, this is “black box” software, so its results are hard to evaluate.

3. Statistics-based. Uses statistical analysis to estimate the probability of
customer default or delinquency. However, it requires a statistics expert
to implement.

4. Genetic algorithm—based. Uses a trial-and-error approach to select the best
prediction model. However, this is a very new approach and is not yet well
understood within the credit analysis field.

A company should not attempt to create its own credit-scoring system from
scratch; commercial off-the-shelf packages are available. The implementation of
these systems can be lengthy, but the quality of the underlying software will exceed
anything that a company’s own programming staff can develop.

Such models make sense if a company feels that the information it has
accumulated about customers or specific sectors of the economy is so valuable
that it can lead to credit scores having much higher levels of accuracy. The
information that can be incorporated into such a scoring system could include a
multiyear history of customer payments, customer service records of contacts with
customers, customer financial statements, and customer trade references.

Once the model has been constructed, a significant amount of testing should
be done to see how well it operates. One testing method is to compare the
internal credit rating to the ratings produced by outside credit reporting agencies.
Any major inconsistencies between the internal and external ratings should be
investigated. A large variance does not mean that the company’s scoring system
is necessarily wrong, but someone should verify what specific information is
causing the discrepancy, and whether that information improves the accuracy of
the score.

Creating an in-house system is extremely time-consuming, requiring labor for
data preparation, the selection of variables, searches for data correlations, and
model fitting. The expense of creating this system is considerable, and so it is only
an option for large, well-funded companies that need improved scoring on large
numbers of customers.

8-9 Modify Credit Application Terms to Favor the Company

Too many companies create credit applications that are boilerplate models they
copied from the Internet or purchased through an office supply store. The terms of
these agreements may include loopholes that customers can exploit to avoid or
delay payments.

The credit application is perhaps the only document that a credit department
will persuade a customer to sign (if the customer wants a line of credit), thereby
turning it into a legal document; therefore, modify it to enhance the company’s
ability to collect overdue receivables. Consider including the following clauses:

¢ ACH debit clause. Include a clause stating that the customer agrees to have
the company debit its bank account for open accounts receivable as of a
specific number of days following billing, and leave space for the customer to
enter bank account information.

¢ Arbitration clause. The steps followed in the arbitration process are similar to
those used in normal legal proceedings, but they follow a more compressed
timeline, with judgment being rendered by an arbitrator. The clause should
specify which issues will be subject to arbitration, and the steps both parties
will follow during the process. Keeping the arbitration clause as specific as
possible will keep the two parties from wrangling over how the arbitration is to
be conducted, thereby shortening the period before the company achieves final
resolution of the contested issue.

¢ Credit venue provision. If a customer defaults on a payment, the company
will want to litigate the case as close to home as possible in order to avoid
travel costs. This can be achieved by inserting a clause that any recourse to the
courts will be settled in the company’s state of residence.

¢ Duty to inspect. A customer may claim well after the date of receipt that a
delivery was damaged and use this as the basis for nonpayment. To sidestep
this issue, insert a clause requiring the customer to inspect received goods and
issue a complaint to the company within a specific period of time, after which
the customer waives any further claims.

¢ Security interest provision. This clause gives the company a security
interest in any goods shipped to the customer. If used, the company needs
a procedure for perfecting any security interests received. This is time
sensitive, because the first security interest publicly filed has priority over
later claims.

¢ Personal guarantee. Company owners frequently have more assets than their
companies, so obtaining a personal guarantee is certainly worth a try.
¢ Reimbursement for collection fees. The collection department may resort to

the use of a collection agency or attorney to collect a past-due account. By
having the customer agree in advance to reimburse the company for these


8-10 Create a Credit Application Guidebook 179

added expenses, it may be possible to use the threat of this clause to accelerate
customer payment.

¢ Reimbursement for NSF fees. If a customer pays with a check that does not
clear because there are not sufficient funds (NSF) in the account, the company
will be charged a fee by the bank. The customer should agree to reimburse the
company for this charge. Better yet, include a standard fee in the credit
application that is even higher than the bank’s fee, so the company is also
compensated for its transaction-handling costs.

¢ Charge for duplicate invoices. If customers continually ask for a duplicate of
an invoice that was already sent, this is a likely sign of a payment-delaying
tactic. If there is a clause in the agreement that specifies a modest fee for
supplying additional copies, the collections staff can trigger it if it suspects a
customer is abusing the service.

¢ Signature is binding. A customer could claim that the person signing the
credit application is not an officer of the company, and that the agreement is
therefore not binding. To avoid this, include a clause stating that the person
executing the agreement acknowledges that he or she has the authority to enter
into the terms and conditions of the credit application.

If any provision is listed on the back of the credit application or on any page
other than the signature page, include an extra signature or initials line on that page
of the application, thereby giving legal proof that the customer has acknowledged
and agreed to the provision.

A customer who objects to any of these clauses can always cross them out and
put his or her initials next to the alteration. It is then up to the credit manager to
proceed with the application in light of these changes or to reject the application.

If the security interest or personal guarantee provisions are signed, the credit
application becomes a valuable legal document, so make sure that a procedure is in
place to appropriately store the application.

8-10 Create a Credit Application Guidebook

A company’s credit application may contain quite a few fields to be completed, and
there may be a history of having incomplete or incorrect information in some of
those fields. If so, consider asking the company’s sales staff to sit with the customer
and help the person fill out the form. This approach is particularly useful when the
sales staff has a guidebook from the accounting department in which the
application is fully described. In particular, the accounting staff should point
out those questions that are more likely to be responded to incorrectly and should
point out the types of answers that the credit staff is looking for. The guide can even


180 Credit Best Practices

include a sample completed version. Another possibility is to anticipate various
questions that a customer may have in completing the application and note a
complete answer in the guide. It is also useful to include a flowchart of the credit
application process, as well as a timeline by which credit decisions are usually
made.

If the guide is excessively long or packed with text, then the sales staff and
customers are less likely to use it. A better approach is to create a graphically
intensive layout that imparts the most important information over the shortest
number of pages.

8-11 Create a Standardized Credit-Level Determination System

A common complaint of the collections staff is that there does not appear to be any
reasoning behind the credit levels granted to customers, resulting in inordinately
high credit levels for some customers that cannot begin to repay their debt. This
results in considerable effort for the collections staff to bring in cash from these
customers, as well as pleas to the credit department to lower credit to levels that
have some reasonable chance of being repaid. This condition is caused by the
approach of many credit departments to granting credit, which is that they grant the
highest possible credit level to meet the latest order received from a customer. This
approach is advocated heavily by the salesperson who stands to receive a
substantial commission if the sale is approved. Consequently, granting credit
based on the size of a customer’s order rather than its ability to pay leads to
considerable additional collections work.

A solution is to create a procedure for granting credit that uses a single set of
tules that are not to be violated, no matter how much pressure the sales staff
applies to expand credit levels. The exact procedure will vary by credit
department and the experience of the credit manager. As an example, a credit
person can obtain a credit report for a prospective customer and use this as a
source of baseline information for deriving a credit level. A credit report is an
excellent basis on which to create a standard credit level, for the information
contained in it is collected in a similar manner for all companies, resulting in a
standardized and highly comparable basis of information. Such a credit report
should include a listing of the high, low, and median credit levels granted to a
customer by other companies, giving a credit manager the range of credit that
other companies have determined is appropriate. However, just using the range
of credit levels is not normally sufficient, since you must also consider the
number of extra days beyond terms that a customer takes to pay its customers.
This information is a good indicator of creditworthiness and is also contained in
a credit report. A good example of how the “payment” information can be
included in the calculation of a credit level is to take the median credit level other


8-12 Incorporate Collections Information into Credit Decisions 181

companies granted as a starting point and then subtract 5 percent of this amount
for every day that a customer pays its suppliers later than standard payment
terms. For example, if the median credit level is $10,000, and a customer pays an
average of 10 days late, 50 percent of the median credit level is taken away,
resulting in a credit level for the customer of $5,000. The exact system a
company uses will be highly dependent on its willingness to incur credit losses
and expend extra effort on collections. A company willing to obtain more
marginal sales will adopt the highest credit level shown in the credit report and
not discount the impact of late payments at all, whereas a risk-averse company
may be inclined to use the lowest reported credit level and further discount it
heavily for the impact of any late payments by the potential customer.

The range of standard procedures for granting credit levels is infinite. The
main point is to have one consistent basis for creating reasonable customer credit
levels, which gives the collections staff far less work to collect on sales that exceed
the ability of a customer to pay.

8-12 Incorporate Collections Information into Credit Decisions

The credit department typically reaches its credit-granting decisions based on a
specific set of standardized information, which may include a credit report,
financial statements, and a credit application. While adequate for many situations,
there is much more information available within the company that can be used by
the credit staff to grant credit. In particular, the collections department may be
making notes about its conversations with customers regarding the reasons for late
payments. If these notes are being recorded in an online database, then it should be
made available to the credit department for review.

The problem with accessing collections information is that the credit staff
needs to remember to access it at regular intervals, which it may not have time to
do if there are hundreds or thousands of customers. A better approach is to build
a flag into the collections database that the collections staff can trigger whenever
they believe there is a significant problem with a customer. The computer system
spots the flag automatically and sends a message to the credit department that a
customer account should be reviewed. This approach can be expensive to create
but has the advantage of presenting crucial information to the credit staff in short
order.

The collections staff should be very helpful in documenting their conversa-
tions with customers in a database and flagging those conversations, since having
the credit staff involved may cut off some customers who would otherwise create
collection problems for the collections department.

8-13 Require a New Credit Application if Customers
Have Not Ordered in Some Time

If a customer has not placed an order recently, perhaps for a year or more, its
financial situation may have changed considerably, rendering its previously
assigned credit level no longer valid. This is a particular problem when the
customer may be shopping through an industry to see who will accept an order and
is forced back to the company when no other suppliers are willing to deal with it
anymore. If the company’s credit department simply dusts off the old credit review
and allows the same credit limit, there could be a bad debt lurking in the immediate
future.

One solution is to require customers to complete a new credit application after
a preset interval has passed, such as two years. This represents a significant
additional workload for the credit staff, so require this additional review only if the
old credit level was a sufficiently high one to represent a noticeable potential bad-
debt loss. Though the computer system can be designed to flag these customers for
a credit review when new orders arrive, an alternative is to simply purge from the
accounting database all customers with whom there has been no business in the
past two years. Then, when an order arrives and the accounting system shows no
customer record, the credit staff knows it needs to get involved.

8-14 Review the Credit Levels of All Customers Who Stop
Taking Cash Discounts

When a customer stops taking cash discounts, it may mean only that a new
payables person is not aware of the discount and just needs a reminder from the
company in order to start doing so once again. However, a more likely scenario is
that the customer’s financial condition has declined to the point where it no longer
has the cash to make an early payment.

Not taking early payment discounts is an excellent early warning of a decline
in acustomer’s financial condition. If the cash application staff notices this change,
they should notify the credit manager at once, who can reevaluate the customer’s
credit limit.

The real problem with this best practice is noticing when cash discounts stop.
Unless a customer’s payments are so large that their absence is clearly noticeable,
there is not usually an automated way to note their absence. Instead, it may be
necessary for a manager to regularly compare a list of customers who usually take
discounts to the accounts receivable aging. Though this manual approach can be
time consuming, it can save the company from incurring a bad-debt loss. This
review should be conducted by a credit or collections person, on the grounds that
they have the largest vested interest in spotting this problem as early as possible.


8-16 Issue a Payment Procedure to Customers 183

8-15 Call New Customers and Explain Credit Terms

When a new customer receives its first invoice from a company, the standard
sequence of events for the accounts payable staff is to enter the “pay to”
information in the computer system, accept the corporate default payment days
(such as 30), and press the Enter key. By doing so, the customer has completely
ignored the company’s payment terms, not to mention any early-payment dis-
counts that may have been added (and possibly negotiated at some length with the
customer). This is a particular problem early in a company’s relationship with a
new customer, since the credit department is keeping an especially watchful eye on
the payment situation. If payments arrive late, the business partners are off to a bad
start.

The solution is to contact the customer at the beginning of the relationship and
explain the payment terms. By taking the time to make this contact, the customer is
now aware that the company takes payment terms seriously and expects them to be
observed. This contact can take the form of a phone call, personal meeting, or
letter. A phone call or personal meeting is the best alternative, since it gives the
customer a chance to bring up any special payment issues that could interfere with
timely invoice payment.

The key point is to make sure this contact is made with the correct person, or
else the time invested in this best practice will serve no purpose. The best contact is
the accounts payable manager. As an alternative, try the payables clerk to whom
invoices will be sent; this is a less optimal choice, since account responsibilities
may be shuffled among the clerks on a regular basis.

8-16 Issue a Payment Procedure to Customers

When a company sends an invoice to a customer, the customer assumes that the
usual payment arrangements apply—the industry standard number of days to pay,
ship back defective goods without notice, and call the company salesperson if there
are any questions. If the company’s systems are not set up to handle transactions in
this manner, this can cause trouble.

A better approach is to develop a short payment procedure for new customers.
It should certainly list the company’s payment terms, but then go further to list
company contact information as well as the exact process for returning goods and
how to claim a credit. The procedure can even extend to the use of an application
form for payments via Automated Clearing House (ACH). This approach can
greatly reduce the number of problems that the collections staff normally deals
with.


184 Credit Best Practices

Getting the procedure into the hands of all customers can take some work. It can
go out with the next batch of invoices, or be delivered by the sales staff, or be issued
as a separate mailing. If any of the information on the procedure changes, the
distribution must occur again, which can be a chore if there are many customers.

8-17 Join an Industry Credit Group

Credit reports are an extremely useful way to obtain information about customer
locations, business names, and general credit condition. However, they do not
yield the most up-to-date information about a customer’s immediate financial
condition. It is entirely possible that a customer will enter a serious financial
decline a number of months before any hint of its condition appears on a credit
report. In the meantime, the company may have issued a substantial amount of
credit to the customer, leaving the credit manager in a tenuous position.

An excellent solution is to join an industry credit group. These groups
exchange information about specific customers, such as recent problems with
NSF checks, bankruptcies, accounts being sent to collections, and other financial
difficulties, so the credit department can take quick action to tighten credit where
necessary. This is also an excellent opportunity for networking, so credit personnel
across the industry can more easily exchange information.

The National Association of Credit Management (NACM), which can be
reached at www.nacm.org, maintains a listing of national credit management
groups, including those in Exhibit 8.2. The NACM lists meeting intervals and
contact information for each group’s administrator.

8-18 Refer a Potential Customer to a Distributor

After reviewing a customer’s credit application, the credit department may
conclude that it has no interest in providing any type of credit to a prospective
customer. If the customer is not willing to provide either cash in advance or some
form of security, there may be no further avenue for the company to make a sale.

Even if the company itself cannot grant credit, it is possible that a distributor will
have a looser credit policy. If the company has a distribution network, refer
the customer to a distributor. This approach can indirectly result in a sale for the
company, though of a lesser size than it would have experienced with a direct sale
(due to the distributor commission or markup). Nonetheless, if the credit department
considers a customer to have significant credit risk, this may be a viable alternative.

8-19 Require Intercorporate Guarantees

A credit manager is sometimes confronted with a situation where a customer does
not have a good credit record and its managers are hired staff who have no intention
of adding their personal guarantees to an order. Is there a way to still grant credit?

It is possible that the company is a subsidiary of another corporate entity. If so,
request that the parent company issue a guarantee making the parent liable for the
subsidiary’s debt. If the company chooses to exercise this guarantee, it is
customary to warn the customer that the company intends to contact the guaran-
teeing entity not only as a courtesy but also because this makes the customer more
likely to pay.

This approach calls for the examination of the parent’s credit in place of the
subsidiary, so an additional credit review must be conducted. Also, this type of
guarantee may be unenforceable if there is no obvious consideration given to the
guaranteeing entity in exchange for its guarantee. If this may be a problem, clearly
specify the form of consideration given within the guarantee document. Further,
review the guaranteeing company’s board minutes, articles of incorporation, or bylaws
to see if it is authorized to grant a guarantee—if not, the guarantee is unenforceable.

If the guarantee is granted, be sure to store it in a locked file for safekeeping,
and make note of the guarantee in the customer file.

8-20 Obtain Check Verification and Guarantee Coverage

Retail organizations accept large quantities of checks from their customers, and
many of those checks will not clear the bank, causing a loss for the company. They


186 Credit Best Practices

can resolve this issue by no longer accepting checks, but that solution can reduce
sales.

An alternative is to use a check verification service. Verification means that
the company submits each check it receives from customers through a check
scanner, which extracts account information from each check and transmits it to an
outside national negative database, which compares it to a listing of bad check
writers. If the customer has a history of writing bad checks, then the system
declines the check. The fee for this service is a few cents per check submitted, plus
a monthly fixed fee.

An expansion of the check verification service is the check guarantee
program. It is essentially a credit insurance service where the provider
guarantees payment on each check submitted to it. The guarantee process is
the same as the verification process just described, except that the check
guarantee provider will issue a specific approval; the company is now guaran-
teed payment on that specific check. The company is also responsible for
obtaining some additional information from the customer, such as a driver’s
license number and phone number. Upon acceptance, the check is converted into
an electronic check, and payment will be sent directly to the company’s
designated bank account. If a customer complains about having a check rejected,
the employee handling the transaction can hand over the business card of the
check verification service and suggest that the customer contact the service
directly.

If the check guarantee provider ends up paying the company for a dis-
proportionate number of bad checks, the provider may cancel the guarantee
program with the company. The check guarantee fee is based on a per-check
fixed charge, plus a percentage of the amount of the check.

The total cost to the company is roughly the same as or somewhat lower than
the fees charged under a credit card program. Generally, the verification service is
sufficient; the extra percentage fee required for a guarantee program is frequently
higher than the losses on bad checks that a company would otherwise have
experienced.

When looking for the best check verification and guarantee coverage, select
the one with the largest possible national negative database, since this will provide
the best coverage of potential bad check writers.

8-21 Obtain Credit Insurance

Letters of credit take time to set up, are difficult to monitor, and must be followed to
the letter in order to be paid. This process makes smaller companies less than
willing to enter into international sales. Also, companies of any size may be
unwilling to grant large lines of credit or even smaller ones if customers have some


8-22 Obtain an Export Credit Guarantee 187

risk of nonpayment. In both instances, a prudent credit manager may recommend
dropping a potential sale.

An increasingly common solution to this dilemma is the use of credit
insurance. This is essentially a guarantee against customer nonpayment. It is
faster to set up than a line of credit, can be used for both domestic and international
receivables, and allows a company to increase its credit lines to customers. Also,
for those companies willing to take on some credit risk themselves, they can extend
a larger credit line than the credit insurance company may allow, thereby giving
themselves the opportunity to earn additional revenue. Further, a company using
credit insurance can reduce the size of its bad-debt reserve, as well as offer a
higher-quality accounts receivable base as collateral for a line of credit. Credit
insurance is available for domestic credit, export credit, and coverage of custom
products prior to delivery, in case customers cancel orders.

Ifa credit insurance policy stipulates a maximum credit limit per customer, the
insurance company must make the decision to increase the credit limit, or the
company can take on the uninsured risk of granting extra credit. If the policy
contains no maximum limit at all, the insurance company has control over the
credit limit granted to each customer. If a customer is considered by the insurance
agency to be high risk, it will likely grant no insurance at all. Also, goods being
exported to countries with a high perceived level of political risk will not be
granted credit insurance.

The cost of credit insurance can exceed 0.5 percent of the invoiced amount,
with higher costs for riskier customers and substantially lower rates for customers
considered to be in excellent financial condition. The company does not have to
absorb this cost; where possible, consider rebilling it to the customer, who may be
willing to pay it in order to obtain a larger line of credit than would otherwise be the
case.

When entering into a credit insurance policy, be sure to focus on its
exclusionary language. For example, credit insurance does not necessarily include
disputes, such as when goods arrive late or damaged. It is useful to itemize
the various exclusions and then review how many receivable disputes would
have fallen into those exclusions in the past year, to see if a proposed credit
insurance policy is truly cost effective.

8-22 Obtain an Export Credit Guarantee

Sometimes, a company cannot obtain credit insurance or a letter of credit for a
potential sale to a foreign customer, resulting in the painful decision to either
extend credit in a risky situation or to walk away from a potential sale.

The Export-Import Bank of the United States (www.exim.gov) offers an
export credit guarantee to anyone shipping domestic goods to a foreign customer,


188 Credit Best Practices

which can provide an excellent boost to sales. Also, because the U.S. government
now guarantees a company’s foreign receivables, the company will have a much
better chance to obtain debt that is collateralized by its receivables. Furthermore,
the Bank’s multibuyer policy guarantees payment on all qualifying international
sales on open account terms. Other policies are available for short- and medium-
term sales to individual buyers.

It is also possible to obtain preshipment coverage, so a company will not have
to worry about an order cancellation for a custom order requiring a long time
period to prepare for shipment. Further, the Bank may grant credit guarantees even
for sales into high-risk countries that a private insurer will avoid.

To obtain a guarantee, the exporting company must submit an application
containing information about the customer, such as a credit report (containing a
Dun & Bradstreet Paydex score of at least 50, indicating average payments no
more than 30 days slow) and trade references; larger shipments also require the
customer’s financial statements (audited for several years, if the proposed guarantee
exceeds $1 million). Also, the customer must have been in the same general line of
business for at least three years. Finally, for large transactions, operating and net
profit, current ratio, and total liabilities/net worth standards must be met. If accepted,
the exporting company must pay the full amount of the coverage premium in
advance. Premiums will vary by the amount of coverage, evaluation of the customer,
and the country in which the customer is based. The guarantee is only for a portion of
the net contract value on domestic goods (usually 95 percent), so the company must
still incur some of the risk of nonpayment. Also, this guarantee is not available for
military sales or to countries that have not been approved by the government.

One issue with using the Bank is that it establishes fees on a fixed schedule that
changes only infrequently so that its prices can vary considerably from those of
private insurers. This can result in significant overpricing from time to time.

8-23 Shorten the Terms of Sale

There may be cases where a customer wants to place a large number of small orders
with a company, cumulatively resulting in a large credit line before the company’s
typical terms period has expired. For example, it may plan to place 10 orders for
$3,000 each within the company’s standard 30-day terms period, resulting in a
required credit line of $30,000. However, the customer’s financial condition may
not warrant this level of credit risk by the company.

A solution is to shorten the terms of sale. In the above scenario, reducing
payment terms to 15 days would mean that the customer should be able to purchase
the same quantity of goods from the company on a credit line of just $15,000.

This approach works only if a customer is placing many small orders rather
than one large one, the orders are evenly spaced out, and the customer’s own cash

to only a minority of situations.

8-24 Insist on Lien Rights

If a company is supplying labor or equipment under the terms of a construction
contract, it is likely that the contract contains a lien waiver. Under this provision,
the company cannot file a lien on the customer in the event of customer
nonpayment. This is an especially common provision that a customer will insist
on in exchange for paying the company. This is not a large problem if the customer
is large and well funded, but it can be a major problem if the customer is small and
undercapitalized.

When initially signing a construction contract with a customer, review it for a
lien waiver and either strike it or modify it to only waive the lien to the extent of
progress payments already made to the company. Further, the waiver should apply
only if the customer does not file for bankruptcy within 90 days after the funds clear.
In the event of a bankruptcy, the company will likely be sued for the return of any
funds paid to it within 90 days before the filing, so it is important to retain lien rights
in order to protect the receivable. If the customer attempts to impose the waiver at a
later date, then the company should have the same objective in dealing with it.

8-25 Offer a Financing Program

The goal of the credit department should be to find a way to assist the sales
department in making a sale while still ensuring payment. This can be an
exceptionally difficult goal for marginal accounts, which deserve cash in
advance terms but do not have the funds to pay in this manner. The typical
result is no sale.

If there is a significant customer base falling into the marginal credit
category and management is determined to achieve sales in this niche,
consider creating a financing program. This can be an internal program funded
by the company or one outsourced to a third party. Interest rates charged are
likely to be extremely high in order to offset the very high bad-debt risk.
However, bad debts will arise in this area, and a smartly managed financing
program that takes risk into account can achieve significant additional sales for a
company.

8-26 Combine COD Terms with a Surcharge

Customers may be unable to pay off existing receivables in anywhere near the
established time interval because of financial problems. However, the company
may be the only supplier of a key product, so the customer cannot go elsewhere for
its purchases. The company’s credit department may be extremely unwilling to
extend additional credit, so what can the two parties do to make the relationship
beneficial for both?

If the customer is in a position where it can pay a small amount each month
toward the existing receivable balance, the credit department can consider
offering either cash on delivery (COD) or cash in advance (CIA) terms, coupled
with a surcharge designed to gradually pay off the existing balance. By doing so,
the company can record additional sales while avoiding the incurrence of a bad
debt on the existing receivables. Furthermore, the customer is much more likely
to pay off the existing balance because it needs the company’s continuing
product sales.

If there is a choice between offering COD or CIA terms with a surcharge,
always go with the CIA terms, because a check issued at the time of delivery can
always bounce or be canceled by the customer.

Summary

Ifa company implements most of the credit best practices noted in this chapter, the
result will be an extremely active credit group that is constantly examining the
corporate credit policy, as well as the credit standing of its customers as defined by
a variety of key criteria. The credit process will be proactive, with the credit group
contacting customers directly to explain credit terms and payment procedures,
while also joining industry credit groups to learn more about their customer base.
Although these are all excellent activities that should be encouraged, they will
require additional funding, which must be offset against the savings they will
generate from reduced bad-debt losses.

Commissions Best Practices

The application of best practices to commissions hardly seems to be worth a
separate chapter; however, there are a surprisingly large number of actions that
can streamline the calculation of commissions and their payment to sales
personnel.

This chapter contains 13 best practices, and the main factor to keep in mind is
that they are designed to improve the operations of the accounting department
only. Though none of them will worsen the systems in the sales department, the
other area that is directly impacted, they may have an opposite impact on the
morale of that department. For example, one best practice is to replace convoluted
commission structures with a simplified model. Though this will obviously lead
to easier commission calculations by the accounting staff, it may also have the
negative impact of reducing the sales incentive for those salespeople who are no
longer receiving such a good compensation package. Accordingly, before installing
any of the following best practices, it is a good idea to first gain the approval of
the sales manager to any changes that will directly or indirectly impact the sales
department.

Implementation Issues for Commissions Best Practices

This section illustrates the relative degree of implementation cost and duration for
commission best practices, as displayed in Exhibit 9.1. The level of implementa-
tion difficulty in this area is quite polarized because of one major issue—some of
the recommended changes require the complete cooperation of the sales manager,
who will probably actively resist at least a few of them. Accordingly, the duration
of implementation for these best practices is rated as difficult and long, though they
are actually quite simple if the agreement of the sales manager can somehow be
obtained in advance.

Those best practices that can be completed by the accounting staff without any
outside approval are rated as both inexpensive and short installations. An example
of such a best practice is paying commissions through the traditional payroll
system. The only exceptions to the easy internal accounting changes are two items
that may require some expensive programming assistance. Thus, the range of
implementation difficulty is extraordinarily wide in this functional area.

9-1 Automatically Calculate Commissions in the Computer System

For many commission clerks, the days when commissions are calculated are not
pleasant. Every invoice from the previous month must be assembled and reviewed,
with notations on each one regarding which salesperson is paid a commission, the
extent of any split commissions, and their amounts. Further, given the volume of
invoices and the complexity of calculations, there is almost certainly an error every
month, so the sales staff will be sure to pay a visit as soon as the commission
checks are released in order to complain about their payments. This results in
additional changes to the payments, making them very difficult to audit, in case the
controller or the internal audit manager wants to verify that commissions are being
calculated correctly. The manual nature of the work makes it both tedious and
highly prone to error.


9-2 Calculate Final Commissions from Actual Data 193

The answer is to automate as much of it as possible by having the computer
system do the calculating. This way, the commission clerk only has to scan through
the list of invoices assigned to each salesperson and verify that each has the correct
salesperson’s name listed on it and the correct commission rate charged to it. To
make this system work, there must be a provision in the accounting software to
record salesperson names and commission rates against invoices, a very common
feature on even the most inexpensive systems—though if it does not exist, an
expensive piece of programming work must be completed before this best practice
can be implemented. Then the accounting staff must alter its invoicing procedure
so that it enters a salesperson’s name, initials, or identifying number in the invoicing
record for every new invoice. It is very helpful if the data-entry screen is altered to
require this field to be entered, in order to avoid any missing commissions. Once
this procedure is altered, it is an easy matter to run a commissions report at the end
of the reporting period and then pay commission checks from it. This is a simple
and effective way to eliminate the manual labor and errors associated with the
calculation of commissions.

The main problem is that it does not work if the commission system is a
complex one. For example, the typical computer system only allows for a single
commission rate and salesperson to be assigned to each invoice. However, many
companies have highly varied and detailed commission systems, where the
commission rates vary based on a variety of factors and many invoices have
split commissions assigned to several sales staff. In these cases, only custom
programming or a return to manual commission calculations will be possible,
unless someone can convince the sales manager to adopt a simplified commission
structure. This is rarely possible since the sales manager is the one who probably
created the complicated system and has no intention of seeing it dismantled.

9-2 Calculate Final Commissions from Actual Data

A common arrangement for departing salespeople is that they are paid immediately
for the commissions they have not yet received, but which they should receive in
the next commission payment. Unfortunately, the amount of this commission
payment is frequently a guess, since some sales have not yet been completed and
orders have not even been received for other potential sales on which a salesperson
may have been working for many months. Accordingly, there is usually a
complicated formula in the typical salesperson’s hiring agreement that pays out
a full commission on completed sales, a partial one on orders just received, and
perhaps even a small allowance on expected sales for which final orders have not
yet been received. The work required to complete this formula is highly labor
intensive and frequently inaccurate, especially if an allowance is paid for sales that
may not yet have occurred (and may never occur).


194 Commissions Best Practices

A better approach is to restructure the initial sales agreement to state that
commissions will be paid at the regular times after employee termination until all
sales have been recorded. The duration of these payments may be several months,
which means that the salesperson must wait some time to receive full compensa-
tion, but the accounting staff benefits from not having to waste time on a separate,
and highly laborious, termination calculation. Instead, they take no notice of
whether a salesperson is still working for the company and just calculate and pay
out commissions in accordance with regular procedures.

There are three problems with this approach. First, if the commission calculation
is made automatically in the computer system, sales will probably be assigned to a
new salesperson as soon as the old one has left, requiring some manual tracking of
exactly who is entitled to payment on which sale during the transition period. The
second problem is that if a salesperson is fired, most state laws require immediate
compensation within a day or so of termination. Though the initial sales agreement
can be modified to cover this contingency, you should first check to see if the
applicable state law will override the sales agreement. Finally, this type of payout
usually requires a change to the initial employee contract with each salesperson; the
existing sales staff may have a problem with this new arrangement since they will not
receive payment so quickly if they leave the company. A company can take the
chance of irritating the existing sales staff by unilaterally changing the agreements,
but may want to try the more politically correct approach of grandfathering the
existing staff and only apply the new agreement to new sales employees. In short,
delaying the final commission payment runs the risk of mixing up payments between
old and new salespeople, may be contrary to state laws, and may only be applicable to
new employees. Despite these issues, it is still a good idea to implement this best
practice, even though it may be several years before it applies to all of the sales staff.

9-3 Construct a Standard Commission Terms Table

As salespeople may make the majority of their incomes from commissions, they
have a great deal of interest in the exact rates paid on various kinds of sales. This
can lead to many visits to the commissions clerk to complain about perceived
problems with the rates paid on various invoices. Not only can this be a stressful
visit on the part of the commissions clerk, who will be on the receiving end of some
very forceful arguments, but it is also a waste of time, since that person has other
work to do besides listening to the arguments of the sales staff.

A reasonable approach that greatly reduces sales staff complaints is a
commission terms table. It should specify the exact commission arrangement
with each salesperson so there is absolutely no way to misconstrue the reimburse-
ment arrangement. Once this is set up, it can be distributed to the sales staff, who
can refer to it instead of the commissions clerk. There will be the inevitable rash of


9-5 Simplify the Commission Structure 195

complaints for the first few days after the table is issued since the sales staff will
want clarification on a few key points, possibly requiring a reissuance of the table.
However, once the table has been reviewed a few times, the number of complaints
should rapidly dwindle. The only problem is that listing the commission deals of all
the sales staff side by side on a single document will lead to a great deal of analysis
and arguing by those sales personnel who think they are not receiving as good a
commission arrangement. To avoid this problem, separate the table into pieces so
each salesperson sees only that piece of it that applies to the individual. By
following this approach, the number of inquiries and commission adjustments that
the accounting staff must deal with will rapidly decline.

Cost: SF Installation time:

9-4 Periodically Issue a Summary of Commission Rates

Even companies with a simplified and easily understandable commission structure
will sometimes have difficulty communicating this information to the sales staff.
The problem is that the information is not readily available for sales personnel to
see, and so they are always breeding rumors about commission alterations
impacting their income. This causes a continuing morale problem, frequently
resulting in needless inquiries to the accounting department.

The simple solution is to periodically issue a summary of commission rates. If
management is comfortable with revealing the entire commission structure for all
personnel, it can issue a commission table to the entire sales force. If not, it can
issue a salesperson-specific commission listing. The table should be issued no less
frequently than annually. A good way to present the commission information is to
include it in the annual review, allowing each salesperson time to review it and ask
questions about it. Also, the commissions table should be reissued and discussed
with the sales force every time there is a change in the table, which keeps the
accounting staff from having to explain the changes after the fact when the sales
staff calls to inquire about the alterations. In short, up-front communications with
the sales staff is a good way to keep the accounting department from having to
answer inquiries about commission information.

9-5 Simplify the Commission Structure

The bane of the accounting department is an overly complex commission structure.
When there are a multitude of commission rates, shared rates, special bonuses, and
retroactive booster clauses, the commission calculation chore is mind-numbing
and highly subject to error, which causes further analysis to fix. An example of


196 Commissions Best Practices

such a system, based on an actual corporation, is for a companywide standard
commission rate, but with special increased commission rates for certain counties
considered especially difficult regions in which to sell, except for sales to certain
customers, which are the responsibility of the in-house sales staff, who receive a
different commission rate. In addition, the commission rate is retroactively
increased if later quarterly sales targets are met, and are retroactively increased
a second time if the full-year sales goal is reached, with an extra bonus payment if
the full-year goal is exceeded by a set percentage. Needless to say, this company
went through an endless cycle of commission payment adjustments, some of which
were disputed for months afterward. Also, this company had great difficulty
retaining a commissions clerk in the accounting department.

The obvious resolution is a simplification of the overall commission structure.
For example, the previous example can be reduced to a single across-the-board
commission rate, with quarterly and annual bonuses if milestone targets are
reached. Though an obvious solution and one that can greatly reduce the work
of the accounting staff, it is only implemented with the greatest difficulty because
the sales manager must approve the new system, and rarely does so. The reason is
that the sales manager probably created the convoluted commissions system in the
first place and feels that it is a good one for motivating the sales staff. In this
situation, the matter may have to go to a higher authority for approval, although
this irritates the sales manager. A better and more politically correct variation is to
persuade the sales manager to adopt a midway solution that leaves both parties
partially satisfied and still able to work with each other on additional projects. In
the long run, as new people move into the sales manager position, there may still be
opportunities to more completely simplify the commission structure.

9-6 Include Commission Payments in Payroll Payments

If a company has a significant number of sales personnel, the chore of issuing
commission payments to them can be a significant one. The taxes must be compiled
for each check and deducted from the gross pay, the checks must be cut or a wire
transfer made, and, for those employees who are out of town, there may be other
special arrangements to get the money to them. Depending on the number of checks,
this can interfere with the smooth functioning of the accounting department.

A simple but effective way to avoid this problem is to roll commission
payments into the regular payroll processing system. By doing so, the payroll
calculation chore is completely eliminated, once the gross commission amounts
are approved and sent to the payroll staff for processing. The system will calculate
taxes automatically, issue checks or direct deposits, or mail to employees,
depending on the distribution method the regular payroll system uses. This
completely eliminates a major chore.


9-8 Pay Commissions Only from Cash Received 197

There are two problems with this best practice. First, the commission payment
date may not coincide with the payroll processing date, which necessitates a
change in the commission payment date. For example, if the commission is always
paid on the fifteenth day of the month, but the payroll is on a biweekly schedule, the
actual pay date will certainly not fall on the fifteenth day of every month. To fix this
issue, the commission payment date in the example could be set to the first payroll
date following the fifteenth of the month. Second, by combining a salesperson’s
regular paycheck with the commission payment, the combined total will put the
employee into a higher pay bracket, resulting in more taxes being deducted (never
a popular outcome). This issue can be resolved either by setting employee
deduction rates lower or by separating the payments into two separate checks
in the payroll system in order to drop the payee into a lower apparent tax bracket.
As long as these issues are taken into account, merging commissions into the
payroll system is a very effective way for the accounting staff to avoid cutting
separate manual commission checks.

9-7 Lengthen the Interval between Commission Payments

Some commissions are paid as frequently as once a week, though monthly
payments are the norm in most industries. If there are many employees receiving
commission payments, this level of frequency results in a multitude of commission
calculations and check payments over the course of a year.

It may be possible in some instances to lengthen the interval between
commission payments, reducing the amount of commission calculation and
paycheck preparation work for the accounting department. This best practice is
useful only in a minority of situations, however, because the commissions of many
sales personnel constitute a large proportion of their pay and they cannot afford to
wait a long time to receive it. However, there are some instances where salespeople
receive only a very small proportion of their pay in the form of commissions. In
this situation, it makes little sense to calculate a commission for a very small
amount of money and is better to only do it at a longer interval, perhaps quarterly or
annually. Though it can be used only in a few cases, this best practice is worth
considering.

9-8 Pay Commissions Only from Cash Received

A major problem for the collections staff is salespeople who indiscriminately sell
any amount of product or service to customers, regardless of the ability of those


198 Commissions Best Practices

customers to pay. When this happens, the salesperson is focusing only on the
commission that will result from the sale and not on the excessive work required of
the collections staff to bring in the payment from the supplier, not to mention the
much higher bad-debt allowance needed to offset uncollectible accounts.

The solution is to change the commission system so that salespeople are paid a
commission only on the cash received from customers. This change will instantly
turn the entire sales force into a secondary collection agency, since they will be
very interested in bringing in cash on time. They will also be more concerned about
the creditworthiness of their customers, since they will spend less time selling to
customers that have little realistic chance of paying.

There are a few problems that make this a tough best practice to adopt. First, as
it requires salespeople to wait longer before they are paid a commission, they are
markedly unwilling to change to this new system. Second, the amount they are paid
will be somewhat smaller than what they are used to receiving, since inevitably
there will be a few accounts receivable that will never be collected. Third, because
of the first two issues, some of the sales staff will feel slighted and will probably
leave the company to find another organization with a more favorable commission
arrangement. Accordingly, the sales manager may not support a change to this kind
of commission structure.

A problem directly related to the accounting systems (and not the intransi-
gence of the sales department!) is that since commissions are now paid based
on cash received, there must be a cash report to show the amounts of cash
received from each customer in a given time period, in order to calculate
commissions from this information. Alternatively, if commissions are based on
cash received from specific invoices, the report must reflect this information.
Most accounting systems already contain this report; if not, it must be pro-
grammed into the system.

9-9 Increase Commissions for Cash in Advance Payments

In a typical commission plan, the salesperson is paid once an invoice is issued to
the customer, which gives the salesperson no incentive to ensure that those
invoices are paid. As noted in the preceding best practice, the issue can be
resolved by paying commissions only after cash has been received from customers.
However, this latter approach may still require a certain amount of collections
effort by the salesperson and the collections staff.

An even more efficient commission method is to pay salespeople a higher
commission if they can obtain cash in advance for a sale. Though the additional
payment may seem excessive, consider that the company obtains use of the cash
sooner, has no bad-debt risk, and will not need to waste the time of the collections
department to obtain payment.

certainly be made available to the sales staff, in case they see an opportunity to
obtain a cash in advance payment.

9-10 Periodically Audit Commissions Paid

Given the complexity of some commission structures, it comes as no surprise that
the sales staff is not always paid the correct commission amount. This is
particularly true of transition periods, where payment rates change or new sales-
people take over different sales territories. When this happens, there is confusion
regarding the correct commission rates to pay on certain invoices or whom to pay
for each one. The usual result is that there are some overpayments that go
uncorrected; the sales staff will closely peruse commission payments to make
sure that underpayments do not occur, so this is rarely a problem. In addition, there
is a chance that overpayments are made on a regular basis, since any continuing
overpayment is unlikely to be reported by the salesperson on the receiving end of
this largesse.

The best way to review commissions for this problem is to schedule a periodic
internal audit of the commission calculations. This review can take the form of a
detailed analysis of a sampling of commission payments or a much simpler overall
review of the percentage of commissions paid out, with a more detailed review if
the percentage looks excessively high. Any problems discovered through this
process can result in some retraining of the commissions clerk, an adjustment in
the commission rates paid, or a reduction in the future payments to the sales staff
until any overpayments have been fully deducted from their pay. This approach
requires some time on the part of the internal audit staff, but does not need to be
conducted very frequently and so is not an expensive proposition. An occasional
review is usually sufficient to find and correct any problems with commission
overpayments.

9-11 Install Incentive Compensation Management Software

Commission tracking for a large number of salespeople is an exceedingly complex
chore, especially when there are multiple sales plans with a variety of splits,
bonuses, overrides, caps, hurdles, guaranteed payments, and commission rates.
This task typically requires a massive amount of accounting staff time spent
manipulating electronic spreadsheets, and is highly error prone. Most of the other
best practices in this chapter are designed to simplify the commission calculation


200 Commissions Best Practices

structure in order to reduce the amount of accounting effort. However, an
automated alternative is available that allows the sales manager to retain a high
degree of commission plan complexity while minimizing the manual calculation
labor of the accounting staff.

The solution is to install incentive compensation management software, such
as that offered by Synygy and Callidus Software. It is a separate package from the
accounting software, and requires a custom data feed from the accounting data-
base, using the incoming data to build complex data-tracking models that churn out
exactly what each salesperson is to be paid, along with a commission statement.
The best packages also allow for the what-if modeling of different commission
plan scenarios, as well as the construction of customized commission plans that are
precisely tailored to a company’s needs, and can also deliver commission results to
salespeople over the Internet. The trouble with this best practice is its cost. The
software is expensive and requires consulting labor to develop a data link between
the main accounting database and the new software; thus, it is a cost-effective
solution only for those organizations with at least 100 salespeople. The software is
available over the Internet, which eliminates any concerns regarding in-house
software support.

9-12 Post Commission Payments on the Company Intranet

A sales staff whose pay structure is heavily skewed in favor of commission
payments, rather than salaries, will probably hound the accounting staff at month-
end to see what their commission payments will be. This comes at the time of the
month when the accounting staff is trying to close the accounting books, and so
increases their workload at the worst possible time of the month. However, by
creating a linkage between the accounting database and a company’s intranet site,
it is now possible to shift this information directly to a Web page where the sales
staff can view it at any time and without involving the valuable time of the
accounting staff.

There are two ways to post the commission information. One is to wait until all
commission-related calculations have been completed at month-end, and then
either manually dump the data into an HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
format for posting to a Web page or else run a batch program that does so
automatically. Either approach will give the sales staff a complete set of informa-
tion about their commissions. However, this approach still requires some manual
effort at month-end (even if only for a few minutes while a batch program runs).

An alternative approach is to create a direct interface between the accounting
database and the Web page so that commissions are updated constantly, including
grand totals for each commission payment period. By using this approach, the
accounting staff has virtually no work to do in conveying information to the sales

staff. In addition, sales personnel can check their commissions at any time of the
month and call the accounting staff with their concerns right away—this is a great
improvement, since problems can be spotted and fixed at once, rather than waiting
until the crucial month-end closing period to correct them.

No matter which method is used for posting commission information, a
password system will be needed, since this is highly personal payroll-related
information. There should be a reminder program built into the system so that the
sales staff is forced to alter their passwords on a regular basis, thereby reducing the
risk of outside access to this information.

9-13 Show Potential Commissions on Cash Register

The sales manager can have difficulty in motivating the sales staff to sell those
products with the highest margins. This is a particularly galling issue when there
are so many products on hand it is almost impossible to educate the staff about
margins on each one. Consequently, the sales staff sells whatever customers ask
for, rather than attempting to steer them in the direction of more profitable
products, resulting in less-than-optimal corporate profitability.

A rarely used best practice is to itemize the commission rates salespeople
earn on individual products right on the cash register. When combined with a
listing of the commissions on a range of related products, the sales staff can
quickly scan the data, identify those that will make the most money, and steer
customers toward them. Since the products with the highest commissions will
presumably have the highest margins, this practice should result in higher
company margins. The tool can also be used to emphasize sales on products
the company is discontinuing and wishes to clear out of stock. Thus, by
providing detailed information to the sales staff that is also tied to sales
incentives, a company can increase its margins while also better managing
its mix of on-hand products.

One problem is that this approach is usable only in a retail environment where
salespeople ring up sales on the spot. It would not be functional at all, for example,
if a salesperson conducts multiple sales calls on the road, though the concept can be
modified by loading commission rates by product into a laptop computer, which
the salesperson can consult during sales calls. Another issue is that the commission
database will be a very complicated one, especially if commissions on products are
changed frequently, necessitating a listing of commissions by both product and
date. This can be a major programming job, requiring significant computer
resources. Finally, the cash registers must include video display terminals of a
sufficient size to show multiple products and their commissions—if such terminals
do not exist, all retail locations using the system must be equipped with them, a
significant extra expense. If these problems can be overcome, however, the posting

of product commissions on cash registers can lead to a major improvement in
corporate profitability.

Summary

This chapter concentrated primarily on ways to reduce the time, effort, and number
of errors in the calculation of commissions, with a reduced emphasis on better
ways to pay commissions once they have been calculated. They are mostly easy
best practices to implement. However, as noted several times in this chapter,
several of them will directly affect the sales staff and so require the approval of the
sales manager before they can be implemented. Since some of these changes will
not be popular with the salespeople, do not be surprised if that approval is not
forthcoming. If so, an occasional review of unapproved best practices may
eventually find a more malleable sales manager in place, with a different result.
Thus, if at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.

Costing Best Practices

This chapter is concerned with those best practices impacting the cost of products
and the valuation of inventory. They are grouped into three main areas: informa-
tion accuracy, cost reports, and costing systems. The first category, information
accuracy, covers several best practices that review the accuracy of key information
driving the costing of inventory: bills of material, labor routings, and units of
measure. The second category, cost reports, is covered by the largest number of
best practices. These are concerned with modifying or even eliminating the current
cost-reporting systems in favor of a tighter focus on direct costs, materials, costs
trends, and obsolete inventory. The final category, costing systems, addresses the
three costing systems that should at least supplement, if not replace, traditional
costing systems: throughput analysis, activity-based costing (ABC), and target
costing. When the complete set of best practices advocated in this chapter has been
implemented, a company will find that it has a much better grasp of its key product
costs and how to control them.

each of the best practices discussed later in this chapter. Each best practice is
noted in Exhibit 10.1, along with a rating of the cost and duration of imple-
mentation for each one. Generally speaking, these are easy best practices to
install because most of them can be completed with no other approval than the
controller’s, and they have a short implementation duration and are quite
inexpensive to install and operate. The main exceptions are throughput analysis,
target costing, and activity-based costing, which require a major commitment of

time and staff and the approval of other department managers, depending on
their levels of involvement in the implementations. However, despite the level of
installation difficulty for these three best practices, they have the most significant
positive impact of all the improvements noted in this chapter and thus are well
worth the effort.

There are also several cost-reporting changes advocated in this chapter.
Though the reports are not hard to alter or replace, it can be quite another matter
to convince the report recipients that they are now receiving better information,
especially if they are old-line managers who have received the same cost reports
for decades. Consequently, the time required to insert a new cost report into a
company’s standard reporting package can take much longer than you would
normally expect.


10-1 Audit Bills of Material 205

10-1 Audit Bills of Material

When the accounting department issues financial statements, one of the largest
expenses listed on it is the material cost (at least in a manufacturing environment).
Unless they conduct a monthly physical inventory count, the accounting staff must
rely on the word of the logistics department in assuming that the month-end
inventory listed on the books is the correct amount. If it is not, the financial
statements can be off by a significant amount. The core document used by the
logistics department that drives the accuracy of the inventory is the bill of material.
This is a listing of the components that go into a product. If it is incorrect, the parts
assumed to be in a product will be incorrect, which means that product costs will be
wrong, too. This problem has the greatest impact in a backflushing environment,
where the bills of material determine how many materials are used to produce a
product. Thus, the accuracy of the bills of material has a major impact on the
accuracy of the financial statements.

The solution is to follow an ongoing program of auditing bills of
material. By doing so, errors are flushed out of the bills, resulting in better
inventory quantity data, which in turn results in more accurate financial
statements. The best way to implement bill audits is to tie them to the
production schedule so that any products scheduled to be manufactured in the
near future are reviewed the most frequently. This focuses attention on those
bills with the highest usage, though it is still necessary to review the bills of
less frequently used products from time to time. The review can be conducted
by the engineering staff, the production scheduler, the warehouse staff, and
the production staff. The reason for using so many people is that they all have
input into the process. The engineering staff has the best overall knowledge of
the product, while the production scheduler is the most aware of production
shortages caused by problems with the bills, and the warehouse staff sees
components returned to the warehouse that were listed in the bills but not
actually used; the production staff must assemble products and knows
from practical experience which bills are inaccurate. Thus, a variety of
people (preferably all of them) can influence the bill of material review
process.

Measuring a bill of material includes several steps. One is to ensure that
the correct part quantities are listed. Another is to verify that parts should be
included in the product at all. Yet another is that the correct subassemblies
roll up into the final product. If any of these items are incorrect, a bill of
material should be listed as incorrect in total. For a large bill with many
components, this means that it will almost certainly be listed as incorrect
when it is first reviewed, with rapid improvement as corrections are made.
The target that a company should shoot for when reviewing bills of material
is a minimum accuracy level of 98 percent. At this level, any errors will
have a minimal impact on accuracy, cost of the inventory, and cost of goods
sold.


206 Costing Best Practices

If a controller can effectively work with the engineering, production, and
logistics staffs to create a reliable bill of material review system, the result is a
much more accurate costing system.

10-2 Audit Labor Routings

The labor a company charges to each of its products is derived from a labor
routing, which is an engineering estimate of the labor hours required to produce a
product. Unfortunately, an inaccuracy in the labor-routing information has a
major impact on a company’s profitability for two reasons. One is that the labor
hours assigned to a product will be incorrect, resulting in an incorrect product
cost. By itself, this is not usually a major problem, because the labor cost is not a
large component of the total product cost. However, the second reason is the real
problem—since the labor rate is frequently used as the primary basis on which
overhead is allocated to products, a shift in the labor rate can result in a massive
change in the allocated overhead cost, which may be much larger than the
underlying labor cost. Thus, an inaccurate labor routing can have a major impact
on the reported cost of a product.

The best practice that addresses this problem is auditing labor routings. By
doing so, you can gradually review all labor records and verify their accuracy,
thereby avoiding any miscosting of products. To do so, enlist the help of the
engineering manager, who assigns a staff person to review this information on a
regular basis and make changes as needed. The accounting department can assist in
the effort by comparing the labor routings of similar products to see if there are any
discrepancies and bring them to the attention of the engineering department for
resolution. Also, it can review computer records (if they exist) to see when labor
routings have been changed and verify the alterations with the engineering staff.
Finally, the accounting staff can work with the production planning department to
see if the assumed production-run quantities noted in the labor routings match
actual production quantities. This last item is a critical one, for the assumed per-
unit labor quantity will go down as the run length increases, due to the improved
learning curve that comes with longer production runs, as well as the larger number
of production units over which the labor setup time can be spread. Some
unscrupulous businesspeople will assume very short production runs in order
to increase the assumed labor rates in their labor routings, resulting in the
capitalization of much higher labor and overhead costs in the inventory records.
Thus, a continual review and comparison of labor-routing records by the account-
ing staff is a necessary component of this auditing process.

10-3 Eliminate High-Leverage Overhead Allocation Bases

There is nothing more damaging to a company than to make a management
decision based on inaccurate information. Though the accounting department is
devoted to presenting the best possible information to senior management at all
times, there is one area in which it continues to provide inaccurate data: overhead
costs. This is an increasingly large proportion of the costs of many companies, and
it is critical to allocate it to various activities and products properly. To be blunt,
most accountants do a very poor job of allocating these costs, resulting in cost
reports that show inordinately high or low overhead costs being assigned to various
items. When a manager acts on this information, the decision may be a wrong one
because the overhead cost component of the information was wrong. The reason
overhead costing information is incorrect in so many instances is a faulty allocation
base. For example, the most common allocation base is to assign overhead costs to
a product based on the amount of labor cost used to build it. The trouble is that
labor is an increasingly small component of total labor costs, resulting in large
overhead amounts being allocated based on tiny labor costs. The ratio of overhead
to labor costs can reach absurd levels, such as $10 for every $1 of labor. When
there are large differences between the proportion of overhead to the allocation
base, even a slight change in the allocation base will result in a large swing in the
overhead costs. Thus, minute month-to-month differences in the allocation base
can falsely alter product costs by significant amounts.

The best practice that resolves this problem is to find new allocation bases that
are not so highly leveraged. By doing so, there is less chance of having unusual
cost swings based on small alterations in the allocation base. A good rule of thumb
is to keep the ratio of allocation base to overhead cost no higher than one to one and
preferably much less. This way, small changes in the allocation base will result in
similarly small changes in the overhead cost. If the allocation base is not monetary,
use an allocation base that is so large that any large changes are unlikely. For
example, if square footage is used as the allocation base, the chance that the
amount of square footage will suddenly change by an inordinate amount is quite
small. In either case, the goal of reducing wide swings in overhead costs has been
achieved.

This is a simple best practice to implement, usually requiring a modest
investment in investigation time in order to find new allocation bases to replace the
existing ones, as well as a few days of work to set up the allocation formulas. Since
there is little or no programming required, and the approval of other departments is
unnecessary, there is no reason that this implementation cannot succeed in short
order.

This best practice addresses the problem of keeping overhead costs from
changing significantly. Another best practice reviews the problem from a different
angle, which is tightly linking overhead costs to specific activities, resulting in a
more informed allocation of costs to those activities driving the costs. For more

10-4 Simplify Overhead Allocations

A common perception in the accounting department is that the allocation of factory
overhead to inventory and the cost of goods sold should be a finely managed
calculation, where greater complexity equates to a more accurate allocation, which
in turn yields more accurate financial statements. The trouble is that these
calculations can be inordinately time-consuming and require additional examina-
tion time by the outside auditors. Also, the additional level of allocation accuracy
does not improve management decision making, since managers generally exclude
these allocations from the internal reports that they rely on to make decisions.

The real reason that overhead is allocated at all is that the accounting standards
require that the allocation be included in a company’s financial statements. The
accounting standards give only general guidance regarding how allocations are to
be calculated, so it makes sense to remain within the guidelines of the accounting
standards while simplifying the allocation calculations to the greatest extent
possible. This means using a single cost pool and allocating based on a perform-
ance measure that is already being tracked within the company. In addition, be sure
to retain the same allocation system from period to period, so there will be no
problems having to justify to the auditors why changes are continually being made
to the allocation methodology. In short, overhead allocation should be simple and
consistently applied.

10-5 Assign Overhead Personnel to Specific Subplants

One of the largest headaches for the cost accounting staff is determining what
overhead costs are assigned to which products. Not only are these assignments
subject to considerable personal interpretation, but also they can strongly impact
the way management views the profitability of various products. For example, if
the assignment is made to a product of overhead costs that are not related to its
manufacture, storage, or use in any way, its costs will appear artificially high, and
management may even stop manufacturing it on the false grounds that it is not
profitable.

A possible solution is to divide the production area into subplants, each one
assigned the task of manufacturing a subset of all company products. You can then


10-7 Eliminate Labor Variance Reporting 209

assign most of the overhead personnel, such as buyers, shop supervisors, and
materials handlers to specific subplants. By doing so, the cost accounting staff can
much more easily allocate overhead costs to specific products. This approach
meshes nicely with the ABC concept, since costs are more closely identified with
specific products.

The trouble is the considerable effort required to reshuffle the production
layout into subplants. Further, if subplants are too small, it may not be possible to
assign staff full time to just one subplant, forcing them to service several subplants
at once and reducing the efficiency of costing allocations.

10-6 Use Perfect Standards for Material Variance Reporting

The typical bill of materials contains a standard amount of scrap that is expected to
occur as part of the manufacturing process. Once a reporting period is completed,
the cost accountant summarizes the standard amount of expected scrap listed in the
bills of material, and constructs variances by comparing the standard scrap to
actual scrap. The problem with this approach is that the company adopts a mindset
that the standard scrap levels are acceptable, and so never undertakes any scrap
reduction activities that will shrink the amount of “standard” scrap.

To avoid this mind-set trap, assume a zero level of baseline scrap for variance
reporting purposes. Also, rather than reporting a materials variance, instead report
on the total amount of wasted materials (since there is no longer a baseline from
which to calculate a variance). By making these changes, management can now see
the total amount of scrap and presumably take action to reduce it to levels well
below their former levels.

The cost accountant’s variance reporting is now replaced with a detailed
examination of the dollar value of various types of scrap, which helps management
direct its efforts into the reduction of those sources of waste having the greatest
dollar value. Thus, the cost accountant is constantly reshuffling the waste data to
ascertain where the next waste reduction campaign can be most profitably initiated,
which will likely include the use of root cause analysis. This change in reporting
represents a significant alteration from the former reporting functions of the cost
accountant and may require retraining in problem analysis techniques.

10-7 Eliminate Labor Variance Reporting

The cost components of work-in-process and inventory goods will inevitably
include some labor. However, the proportion of labor in the total cost mix has


210 Costing Best Practices

dropped markedly over the years, with material and overhead costs now predom-
inating. Nonetheless, the costing reports the accounting staff has traditionally
generated are mostly concerned with labor. Examples of these reports are those
detailing overtime, comparing actual to standard labor rates or usage, and labor
efficiency. By comparison, the reports concerned with the materials expense
typically cover only scrap rates and purchase price variances, while many
companies have no reporting for overhead costs at all. Hence, most accounting
departments are misallocating their time in reporting on the smallest component of
product costs.

The solution is to stop reporting on labor variances. The accounting staff will
have more time to spend on reports concerning costs that make up a larger
proportion of product costs. The problem with this best practice is the remarkable
uproar it frequently incites, especially on the part of traditional production
managers who were raised on the concept of tight labor cost controls. Thus,
the best way to implement this item is to carefully educate the production staff on
the following points:

¢ Direct labor is really a fixed cost. In many manufacturing situations, the
direct labor staff cannot be sent home the moment there is no work left to do.
Instead, a company must think about retaining them since they are trained and
more efficient than other people who might be brought in off the street.
Accordingly, it makes a great deal of sense to guarantee regular working hours
to the direct labor staff. By doing so, it becomes apparent that direct labor is
not a variable cost at all and requires much less detailed investigation and
reporting work for the accounting staff.

¢ Other reports are more valuable. If the accounting department only has
enough resources to issue a fixed number of reports, there is a good argument
for eliminating the least useful ones (labor reporting) in favor of ones
involving more costs, such as materials and overhead. You can reinforce
this argument by formulating trial report layouts for new reports that will
replace the labor reports.

¢ Target costing is the real area of concern. Many studies have shown that
costs are not that variable once a product design is released to the factory floor.
Instead, the primary area in which costs can truly be impacted is during the
product design (see best practice 10-12, “Implement Target Costing,” later in
this chapter).

If production management can be convinced that these three points are
accurate, it becomes much easier to eliminate labor variance reporting, either
completely or in part.

The only situation in which this best practice should not be implemented is one
where labor costs still make up the majority of product costs and where those costs
are variable. If labor costs are highly fixed in nature, there is not much point in

continuing to issue reports showing that the costs have not changed from period to
period.

10-8 Follow a Schedule of Inventory Obsolescence Reviews

A great many companies find that the proportion of their inventory that is obsolete
is much higher than expected. This is a major problem at the end of the fiscal year,
when this type of inventory is supposed to be investigated and written off, usually
in conjunction with the auditor’s review or the physical inventory (or both). If this
write-off has not occurred in previous years, the cumulative amount can be quite
startling. This may result in the departure of the controller, on the grounds that he
or she should have known about the problem.

The solution is adopting and sticking to a schedule of regular obsolete-
inventory reviews. This is an unpopular task with many employees because they
must pore over usage reports and wander through the warehouse to see what
inventory is not needed and then follow up on disposal problems. However, these
people do not realize the major benefits of having a periodic obsolete-inventory
review. One is that it clears space out of the warehouse, which may even allow for a
reduction in the space this department needs. Also, spotting obsolete inventory as
early as possible allows a company to realize the best salvage value for it, which
will inevitably decline over time (unless a company is dealing in antiques!).
Further, a close review of the reason an inventory item is in stock and obsolete may
lead to discoveries concerning how parts are ordered and used; changing these
practices may lead to a reduction in obsolete inventory in the future. Thus, there are
a number of excellent reasons for maintaining an ongoing obsolete-inventory
review system.

The composition of the obsolete-inventory review committee is very impor-
tant. There should be an accountant who can summarize the costs of obsolescence,
while an engineering representative is in the best position to determine if a part can
be used elsewhere. Also, someone from the purchasing department can tell if there
is any resale value. Consequently, a cross-departmental committee is needed to
properly review obsolete inventory.

The main contribution of the accounting department to this review is a
periodic report itemizing those parts most likely to be obsolete. This information
can take the following forms:

¢ Last usage date. Many computer systems record the last date on which a
specific part number was removed from the warehouse for production or sale.
If so, use a report writer to extract and sort this information, resulting in a
report that lists all inventory, starting with those products with the oldest “last
used” date.


212 Costing Best Practices

¢ No “where used” in the system. If a computer system includes a bill of
materials, there is a strong likelihood that it also generates a “where used”
report, which lists all of the bills of material for which an inventory item is
used. If there is no “where used” listed on the report, it is likely that a part is no
longer needed. This report is most effective if bills of material are removed
from the computer system as soon as products are withdrawn from the market;
this more clearly reveals those inventory items that are no longer needed. This
approach can also be used to determine which inventory is going to be
obsolete, based on the anticipated withdrawal of existing products from the
market.

¢ Comparison to previous-year physical inventory tags. Many companies
still conduct a physical inventory at the end of their fiscal years. When this is
done, a tag is usually taped to each inventory item. Later, a member of the
accounting staff can walk through the warehouse and mark down all inventory
items with an inventory tag still attached to them. This is a simple visual
approach for finding old inventory.

¢ Acknowledged obsolete inventory still in the system. Even the best
inventory review committee will sometimes let obsolete inventory fall
through the cracks and remain in both the warehouse and the inventory
database. The accounting staff should keep track of all acknowledged
obsolete inventory and continue to notify management of those items
that have not yet been removed.

Any or all of these reports can be used to gain a knowledge of likely candidates
for obsolete-inventory status. This information is the mandatory first step in the
process of keeping the inventory up to date. Consequently, the accounting staff
plays a major role in this process.

10-9 Eliminate the Tracking of Work-in-Process Inventory

One of the most complex and error-ridden tasks for the cost accountant is the
tracking and accumulation of costs for work-in-process (WIP) inventory. Because
inventory can pass through many workstations, picking up machining and labor
costs as it progresses through the production facility, there can be a multitude of
transactions to accumulate and charge to inventory. Also, because inventory-
tracking systems are typically at their worst in the production area (as opposed to
the controlled environment in the warehouse), it is common to see inventory
records disappear. Materials themselves can also disappear, since scrap can occur
throughout the production process. The end result is a labor-intensive accounting
mess that frequently yields inaccurate costing results.


10-10 Implement Activity-Based Costing 213

The solution requires the conversion of the production process to cellular
manufacturing and the elimination of WIP queues in the production area. Once this
has been accomplished, WIP levels will have been driven so low that there is no
point in tracking WIP at all. Instead, the cost accounting staff will continue to
record items as being in raw materials inventory until they are assembled into final
products, after which they are transferred directly into the finished goods
inventory.

The problem is certainly not with the elimination of WIP inventory—the cost
accounting staff will adopt this practice with enthusiasm. The issue is the massive
alteration in production practices leading to the minimization of WIP inventory.

10-10 Implement Activity-Based Costing

The vast majority of companies only accumulate and report on costs by department
and product. The first method is tied to responsibility accounting, whereby the
costs of the specific department are tied to the performance bonus of its manager.
The second method assumes that the cost of overhead—mostly made up of those
departmental costs noted in the first method—is assigned to products based on the
amount of labor they accumulate. The problem with this approach is that the two
methods should be combined so that all company costs, to the greatest extent
possible, are tied to the actual cost required to produce a product. Without this
information, a company is doomed to make incorrect decisions related to the
correct pricing of products, or even if they should be continued or discontinued.
The same problem applies to determining the cost or profit associated with each
customer. Again, a company can work incorrectly to increase its business with a
high-maintenance customer that results in much lower overall profits, while
abandoning other customers that are really much more profitable. Poor costing
methodologies are at the bottom of many bad corporate decisions.

The solution to this problem is a system called activity-based costing. Under
this approach, a company summarizes all of its costs into a number of cost pools,
then allocates the expenses in those pools to a variety of activities, using a large
number of allocation measures. It becomes much easier to accurately assign the
costs of these activities to various products and customers, based on their usage of
the activities. Though this may seem like nothing more than an elaborate allocation
of overhead, it is actually a carefully constructed methodology for determining the
true cost of a company’s products and services. Along with target costing, it is the
most significant advance in costing methodologies in the last few decades,
eminently worth the effort of putting in place.

However, installing an ABC system is not that easy. The cost pools must be
constructed, allocation measures determined, and new systems created to store,
calculate, and report all of this information. In addition, the cooperation of other


214 Costing Best Practices

departments is necessary to ensure that new allocation measures are properly and
consistently calculated. Finally, management must be apprised of the content of the
new reports that will come out of this system and how they can be used. Given the
considerable cost, time, and training required to ensure that this system becomes
fully operational and accepted by management, it is no surprise that many such
installations have not been completed, and even completed ones do not enjoy the
full support of upper management. Thus, it is not so strange that ABC is the best
cost accounting tool available and yet does not enjoy universal popularity or usage.

From the perspective of the accounting department, installing this system is a
difficult chore. Depending on the size of the company, one or more staff people
should be allocated to the project full-time for many months. In addition, the
existing accounting software almost certainly does not track activity-based costs; a
secondary software package must be purchased that takes information from the
general ledger, as well as allocation bases from a variety of locations, summarizes
data into cost pools, allocates it to activities, and charges costs to products. Also,
given the newness of this approach and the lack of instruction about it at the college
level, the services of a consultant may be worth the added cost. Further, a
considerable amount of management time must go into planning and controlling
the work effort so that it is completed on time without exceeding the budgeted
expenditure level.

10-11 Implement Throughput Accounting

The preceding best practice recommended the use of ABC as a central costing
technique. However, ABC suffers from a key assumption that can result in
incorrect decision making in the short term—it assumes that all costs are variable.
Over the long term, this assumption is correct, since even the largest assets, such as
a building, can be eliminated. However, these costs are fixed in the short term, and
so should not be allocated for short-term order acceptance or manufacturing
prioritization purposes. Thus, ABC can result in the allocation of an excessive
amount of “fixed” costs to a product, resulting in decisions not to accept customer
orders that could have yielded short-term profits.

An alternative system to use for these short-term decisions is throughput
accounting. Under this approach, only the cost of direct materials is considered to
be variable, with all other costs assumed to be fixed in the short term. This
assumption results in significantly larger product gross margins than would be the
case if ABC were used so that lower price points will now be considered to
yield acceptable gross margins. Throughput accounting is especially valid for
manufacturing facilities that use large amounts of machinery, since these assets
are substantially less variable in the short term than would be the cost of
manufacturing labor.

This technique is especially useful for monitoring the usage of work centers

10-12 Implement Target Costing

A cost accounting staff can create the best costing reports in the world, constantly
update this information, and hound the production, engineering, and purchasing
staffs incessantly to improve the situation, and find little change in product costs.
The reason is that most product costs are locked in when the product is designed.
For example, a poor microwave oven design will lead to production inefficiencies
because the product was not designed for ease of manufacturability. Similarly, if
the oven was not designed to be sufficiently sturdy, there will be a number of
customer returns, resulting in added engineering and manufacturing costs to fix the
problem. Further, the oven may contain nonstandard parts that are both difficult
and expensive to obtain and that may not allow for the use of existing parts used
with other products. Thus, cost accounting is focusing on the wrong target—
product costs during production, instead of product costs during the design stage.

The best practice that addresses this issue is called target costing. Under this
concept, the existing market is reviewed and a target price is determined at which a
certain set of product specifications will probably sell quite well. A design team is
then assigned the task of creating a product with those specifications and a
maximum cost. The maximum cost figure allows a company to sell for the
previously determined price while still making an acceptable profit. If it is
impossible to produce the product for the maximum assigned cost, the project
is abandoned. This approach is in contrast to the more traditional method of
designing a product, determining how much it costs when the project is finished,
and then adding on a profit percentage to arrive at a selling price.

The obvious advantage of target costing is that a company has total control
over product costs before any product reaches the production floor. It is easy to
determine which products should be produced and which ones abandoned, thereby
keeping losing or marginally profitable products out of a company’s product mix.
From the accounting department’s perspective, its costing work shifts away from
tracking production costs and into tracking costs during the design phase. This
means that a cost accountant should be reassigned from the first activity to the latter
so that there is a daily review of the range of costs into which target costs are likely
to fall. By shifting the direction of the accounting department’s costing analysis,
you can report on the activities that truly have the greatest impact on product costs.

10-13 Track Excess Capacity

The typical company has excessive production capacity in multiple production
operations, which are constrained by just a few bottleneck operations. Company
management may not realize the extent to which some of its asset investment is
underutilized, which can seriously impact the company’s return on investment.

A solution is to track excess production capacity by work center or individual
machine or person. By doing so, management can ascertain if some assets or
employee positions can be eliminated or even outsourced. However, there are
some issues with this best practice. First, the excess capacity reporting must take
into account the maximum levels of usage that occasionally occur. For example, a
machine may work at only 15 percent capacity on average but have periodic bursts
of activity reaching near 100 percent of capacity when certain types of products
having unique machining requirements are scheduled for production. In these
cases, the excess capacity level should be graphed on a timeline so that manage-
ment can see the level and duration of these capacity utilization spikes. If the spikes
are of short duration, management may conclude that it can still eliminate some
assets and simply outsource the excess levels of work.

A second problem with excess capacity reporting is that management will
have a tendency to use it to eliminate all excess assets, resulting in a “balanced
plant” where there is exactly enough capacity throughout the facility. The trouble
with this approach is that shifting manufacturing requirements and unexpected
work center downtime create a considerable degree of demand fluctuation that
requires some excess capacity to overcome. Thus, some level of excess capacity is
still needed in the production system in order to achieve an optimal production
flow.

10-14 Limit Access to Unit of Measure Changes

The unit of measure field, an innocuous field in the computer system, can have a
major impact on the accuracy of product costs. When the quantity in a bill of
material or inventory record is created, it has a unit of measure listed next to it.
For example, one inch of tape on a bill of materials will have a quantity of one
and a unit of measure of “IN,” or “inch.” However, if the unit of measure is
changed to “RL,” or “roll” without a corresponding reduction in the amount of
tape listed in the quantity field, the amount of tape picked for production will
increase from one inch to an entire roll. The same problem applies to the
inventory, where a change to the unit of measure field without a corresponding
change in the quantity field will result in a potentially massive change in the
amount of inventory on the books. This seemingly minor issue can result in a
major change in the cost of goods sold.


10-15 Report on Landed Cost Instead of Supplier Price 217

The solution is to limit access to the unit of measure field in the computer system,
preferably to one person or position. By doing so, all changes must be reviewed by
one person, who will presumably be trained well enough to realize the relationship
between units of measure and quantities. If access by multiple people cannot be
avoided, then a less reliable variation is to require approval by a manager before
making a change. However, as someone can make a change without approval, this
system is too easy to bypass. A third variation is to carefully review changes in the
unit of measure fields after the fact, perhaps with an occasional internal audit, but this
approach finds problems only after they have already been made; the best solution is
always to keep the problem from occurring in the first place.

An excellent alternative is to set up the computer system so that multiple units of
measure are allowed. To use the previous example, the roll of tape can be listed as both
one roll or 1,760 inches in the same inventory or bill of material record; this approach
eliminates anyone’s need to change the unit of measure field, since all possible
variations are already described. Unfortunately, not all accounting and manufacturing
software packages contain this feature; it is not normally available unless a company is
willing to invest in some complicated and expensive programming.

10-15 Report on Landed Cost Instead of Supplier Price

When the purchasing department focuses exclusively on reducing the purchase
price charged by suppliers, it is not seeing the entire expense associated with
bringing a product to the company. There is also the transportation cost associated
with the purchase, as well as the lot sizes in which items are shipped (and
associated storage requirements), damage incurred while in transit, the potential
for foreign exchange losses, and shipping insurance. For example, the purchasing
department may use an overseas supplier in an attempt to reduce the per-unit cost
of an item. However, by doing so, it must order in much larger lot sizes and several
weeks earlier than was previously necessary. It must also pay for shipping
insurance, as well as the services of an international shipping broker. The net
result is no change in the total cost of the product once it arrives at the company’s
receiving dock.

The solution for the accounting department is to focus the company’s attention
on the landed cost of purchased items rather than the supplier price. By doing so,
the purchasing department gains a better understanding of the total cost of bringing
items to the company and avoids incorrect purchasing decisions that might
otherwise increase company expenses.

The downside is the extra work required by the accounting department. Rather
than simply recording the amount listed on the supplier invoice as the total product
cost, the accounting staff must accumulate expenses from several other sources,
such as foreign exchange costs from the finance department, shipping insurance

and loss claims from the materials management department, and order lot sizes
from the purchasing department. Given the extra accounting effort required,
concentrate recurring landed cost reporting efforts on only the largest-dollar
item purchases, with spot checks of other items.

10-16 Report on Total Customer Price

The sales department uses the company’s standard price list to determine how
much it is charging customers—but is that really the entire price that the customer
pays? The price may actually include a number of other items, such as insurance,
sales taxes, customs fees, and freight. When a customer compares these total costs
that it must absorb to buy the company’s products, it is entirely possible that the
total cost is higher than if the customer bought from other competitors. They may
be located closer so that freight costs are lower, or they may be willing to absorb
insurance costs and so forth. The result may be that a customer unexpectedly
switches to a competitor, even though the company’s posted price for the same
product appears to be lower.

The cost accounting staff can estimate such costs to see what the total cost is
for key customers, not only if they buy from the company but also if they buy from
a selection of key competitors instead. Being aware of these differences in the total
price to the customer allows the sales staff to make informed decisions regarding
whether to change the company’s pricing structure or issue special deals. For
example, if a customer is located near a key competitor, and therefore will pay less
freight to buy from that competitor, then the company can offer to absorb the
freight cost on deliveries. As another example, if an international customer is
shipping with partial ship containers, the company can offer to adjust payment
terms, so the customer can consolidate purchases into less expensive full container
lots.

Reporting on the total customer price obviously includes a great deal of
assumptions about customer costs and the prices of competitors. However, if it
points out a significant pricing disparity, the sales staff should know about the
problem immediately and should be prepared to counter it.

costs relate to standards, there is no way to see if the cost was gradually increased
or decreased from the preset standard cost, if the actual cost was ever close to the
standard cost, or if there have been sudden changes in costs which are probably
related either to step-costs in the overhead category (such as adding a new facility)
or to material cost changes. Given the lack of information, management has no way
of knowing if the current costing situation reflects a deterioration in costs or an
improvement.

The solution is to switch to reporting based on cost trends. An example is
shown in Exhibit 10.2. As noted in the exhibit, the report starts with a base cost
established with actual cost data when the product was first released to production.
Then the series of columns in the middle of the report show the historical total cost
of each product, based on any time period that is most appropriate (quarterly costs
are shown in the exhibit). Then the projected target cost that the company is
striving for is noted to the far right of the report, with a final column noting the
percentage difference in cost between the most recent cost and the target cost,
along with the date by which the company is expecting to achieve the target cost.
This format allows management to easily determine where costing problems are
developing, or if there are potential problems with reaching a targeted cost by the
due date. This approach gives management a much more potent tool to use in
tracking product costs.

Supplemental information can enhance the information shown on the cost
trend chart. For example, it can include a column showing either unit or dollar
volume for each item, allowing management to quickly determine where it should
invest the bulk of its time in fixing problems—on those products that have a large
dollar impact on total revenues, as opposed to those that may have large cost
variances but that have only a negligible profitability impact. It may also be useful
to include the price and margin in the table, though this can be difficult to
determine if pricing varies significantly by customer, perhaps due to variations in


220 Costing Best Practices

the volumes sold to each one. Another reporting possibility is to issue a subsidiary-
level report that breaks down product costs into multiple components, so man-
agement can determine which costs are deviating from expected values. If this
option is used, there should be matching target costs for each component, so
management can compare actual to expected costs in all categories and see where
there are problems. Finally, if there are many variations on a standard product
design, the report may become too lengthy and unwieldy to be easily readable. For
example, this can happen when the same product is issued in 10 different colors,
resulting in a report with 10 line items—one for each product variation. In this
instance, it is useful to cluster each product group into a single line item resulting in
a much shorter and more readable report. All or some of these reporting variations
can give management a better idea of the cost trends to which their products are
subject.

10-18 Review Material Scrap Levels

There are a number of ways to tell if a production process is not operating as
efficiently as it could. For example, labor hours are higher than expected, material
usage exceeds the standard, or delivery times are chronically late. However, the
accounting department does not do well in reporting on late deliveries, since this
does not involve the database of financial information that the accounting staff
normally accesses. Also, the direct labor pool tends to be relatively fixed in the
short term, and so is surprisingly difficult to reduce. Thus, accounting reports
showing excessive labor may not result in an immediate impact on this area.
However, reporting on material scrap rates is well worth the effort. The reason is
that a high scrap rate is the primary indicator of a host of potential problems in the
production process. For example, scrap can be caused by poor operator training,
bad machine maintenance, an excessive level of WIP inventory, and design flaws.
By using material scrap as the prime indicator of problems in the production
process, management can locate the reasons for it, target those problems, and
eliminate them.

The problem for the accounting department is how to issue a valid material
scrap rate report. If the report is inaccurate, management will not believe the
numbers and will not use the information to improve the production process. It is
vital to derive the most accurate information possible from the evidence at hand.
There are a variety of scrap reporting methods available, noted in the following
bullet points:

¢ Weigh the scrap. The simplest method for determining the amount of scrap is
to put it in a pile and weigh it. This is a practical approach if a company can
recycle the bulk of its scrap and therefore keeps it in recycling bins. You can


10-19 Revise Traditional Cost Accounting Reports 221

then weigh the bins and multiply the weight by the average cost of the scrap to
determine a total scrap cost.

¢ Compare standard to actual material usage. The approach that results in
the most detailed information about exactly which material has been scrapped
is a comparison of standard material quantities to actual usage. This requires
accurate bills of material, production records, and inventory counts; without
them, a comparison of these records will not result in an accurate determina-
tion of scrap costs.

¢ Create a floor reporting system. This is the approach used the most by those
companies with poor production records. If they cannot use the preceding
option due to the existence of inaccurate bills of material, production records,
or inventory records, they must require the production staff to manually track
the scrap they are generating. This approach tends to underreport scrap, since
production personnel do not like to report on the inefficiencies of their own
department. Also, the scrap reporting by the manufacturing personnel can be
voluminous and may require extra staff to summarize and analyze. Thus, this
approach is prone to inaccuracy and high reporting costs.

Of the previous scrap reporting methods, some are not accurate enough to
provide more than a rough guess at the exact items that were scrapped, such as
weighing the scrap. The other two reporting systems reveal the most useful
information because they detail the exact items that were scrapped. Of the two,
comparing actual to standard usage is the easiest to implement, since it requires no
additional reporting by manufacturing personnel; however, the standards must
be accurate, or the basis of comparison will not function properly. If the standards
(e.g., bills of material, production records, and inventory records) are not accurate,
you are faced with the problem of either correcting the underlying information or
implementing the final reporting option, which is creating a shop floor reporting
system for tracking actual material scrap rates. The exact reporting method used
will depend on the level of reporting detail needed, as well as the accuracy of a
company’s production database.

10-19 Revise Traditional Cost Accounting Reports

Though many of the other best practices advocated in this chapter involve doing
away with or replacing the existing set of cost accounting reports, there are
instances in which they can be modified sufficiently to still be of great use. This
section deals with a number of small changes that can greatly enhance these
reports. Though it would be best to install all of these upgrades, even using just one


222 Costing Best Practices

or two of them would bring about an incremental improvement in costing
information. The changes are as follows:

¢ Assemble products into reporting groups. Too often, a cost report presents
a list of hundreds of products, sorted by product number. Though there may be
plenty of valid information in such a report, there is no easy way for a busy
executive to determine where it is. Instead, it should be grouped into relevant
categories, such as clustering all product variations into a single summary
number or clustering product sales by customer. These clusters should always
contain subtotals so managers can take in the total cost impact of each group at
a glance.

¢ Give rapid feedback. There is no point in compiling a perfect cost analysis if
it is done months after a product is produced. Instead, a good cost report
should be issued as soon as possible after a product is completed, allowing
management to make changes to improve costs the next time the product is
made. The best case of all is when a cost report is issued to management while
a product is still being made (and preferably near the beginning of a
production run), so immediate alterations will result in a rapid cost reduction.

¢ Report only on exceptions. Some companies have such enormously long
cost reports that there is no way to glance through them and spot the problem
situations. To resolve this issue, reports should be issued that show only
exceptions. For example, a report may show only those products with negative
cost variances of at least 10 percent. By doing so, a voluminous report can be
reduced to a short memo revealing those items requiring immediate attention.

¢ Report on costs by customer. All too many cost reports focus only on
product costs, not the total costs of dealing with each customer. By widening
the focus of a traditional cost report to include this extra information, you can
reveal some startling information, especially if a customer that was previously
thought to be highly profitable is eating up an outsized proportion of a
company’s resources in such areas as purchasing, warehousing, and order
entry.

¢ Use direct costing. Many costing reports show only product margins after
overhead is included in the total costing mix. However, if the overhead
allocation is not valid, management has no way of knowing what the margins
really are and usually ends up ignoring the cost reports entirely. An easy way
to avoid this problem is to insert an extra pair of columns in the cost report, in
which are inserted the dollar margin after direct costs (i.e., price minus labor
and materials) and the direct cost margin percentage. Though this variation
leaves no room for any overhead cost at all, it does result in a good analysis of
direct costs.

These best practices focus on assembling information into a format that is easy
to read, relevant, does not require the reader to wade through vast amounts of data,


Summary 223

and presents information as rapidly as possible. By installing them, you can make
the existing cost reports much more relevant to the decisions that management
must make every day.

Summary

This chapter described a number of best practices that impact inventory costing.
Some involve auditing those underlying documents with the greatest impact on
profitability, such as bills of material and labor routings. Others alter or replace
existing cost reports, resulting in better visibility of costing problems. Finally,
throughput analysis, target costing, and activity-based costing systems can be
installed, giving much control over bottlenecks, costs, and information accuracy,
respectively. These are generally easy implementations, with the exception of the
new costing systems, but implementing the reports will require the approval and
acceptance of those members of management who read them. If properly imple-
mented, all of these changes will result in much better knowledge of costs, which,
if acted on, can make the difference between profits and losses.

Filing Best Practices

This chapter covers the best practices that can be used to create a more efficient filing
system for an accounting department. Though this may seem like such an easy topic
that it does not warrant its own chapter, there are actually many steps that a progressive
accounting staff can take to greatly enhance the efficiency of its filing work.

This chapter does not focus on doing a better job of filing documents. On the
contrary, filing is a totally non-value-added activity, so the focus here is on finding
ways to completely avoid filing. This can be done through a variety of approaches,
including an increased use of electronic documents, standard procedures for
destroying old documents, and keeping paper from being used in the first place.
All of these document prevention techniques are designed to keep paper from ever
reaching the filing staff, thereby allowing a company to reduce the clerical work
associated with filing, while also reducing the amount of space needed to store
documents. These major benefits deserve a separate chapter, no matter how minor
the subject matter may at first appear to be.

Implementation Issues for Filing Best Practices

This section discusses the relative ease or difficulty of implementation of the
best practices to be covered later in this chapter. Each best practice is noted in
Exhibit 11.1. For each best practice, there are columns noting the cost and duration
of implementation. These are relative measures and will vary considerably
depending on the circumstances in each company. In general, the overall level
of implementation is considered to be easiest if a best practice is entirely within the
control of the accounting department, such as for adopting a document-destruction
policy. However, if they involve the cooperation of another department, or if they
require special computer programming to implement, which is the case for many of
the best practices related to storing data on a computer, then the implementation is
assumed to be much more difficult to complete.

The two most expensive best practices are document imaging and extending the
time period before computer records are purged from primary computer storage. The
reason for this assessment is data storage—document imaging requires extremely
large amounts of storage, usually involving a compact disc jukebox with storage
levels in the very high gigabyte range, as does increasing primary storage to extend
the time period over which records are kept in the computer system. In both cases,

The remainder of this chapter covers the best practices for the filing function as
presented in Exhibit 11.1.

11-1 Improve the Mailroom Interface

The proportion of all incoming mail going to the accounting department is
usually well over half the total. Given this volume, the accounting manager


11-2 Reduce Keystroke Errors 227

has considerable interest in ensuring that the mail is properly routed to the
accounting department. A wide variety of efficiencies can apply here, including
the outright elimination of incoming mail, electronic forms, and the digitization
and electronic distribution of received mail. Here are some possibilities to
consider:

¢ Reroute the mail. This means sending checks to a lockbox. Rather than run
the risk of having the mailroom mishandle a check, just have customers send
them straight to a lockbox.

¢ Use electronic forms. If you want customers to complete and send in forms,
such as credit applications or W-9 forms, consider putting an electronic form
on your web site that allows them to send information straight into your
computer system and bypass the mailroom.

¢ Mailroom opens all mail. Don’t just let the mailroom forward envelopes to
employees without first opening them (unless they are marked “‘confidential”’),
since some customers like to send payments to the salesperson assigned to
them—and that person might not open his mail for some time, thereby
impeding cash flow.

¢ Digitize all incoming mail. The mailroom can scan every incoming piece of
mail and e-mail it to employees, which eliminates routing time and stores a
permanent record of the mail in the e-mail system.

11-2 Reduce Keystroke Errors

One of the primary ongoing tasks of any accounting manager is to avoid data-entry
errors, since they cause errors in the reporting of financial results and can be
extremely time consuming to locate and correct. Some traditional techniques
include dual data entry with matching by the computer to spot discrepancies, as
well as bar coding. More recently, Internet-based forms require customers to enter
their own orders, while radio frequency identification (RFID) promises to yield
additional improvements in data-entry error rates.

One of the key problems that managers tend to overlook is the massive
disparity in the error rates for the keying of alphanumeric data versus numeric data.
There are many studies on this topic whose results vary by such factors as the size
of the keyboard used (bigger is better) and the skill of the typist. However, the
relationship between the two error rates is clear enough—entering alphanumeric
data through a keyboard is 100 times more likely to result in an error than numeric
data entered through a keypad, assuming the skills of a normal 60-words-per-
minute typist. The error disparity drops to 25 times for an expert typist, but the
difference is still enormous.


228 Filing Best Practices

How does this impact the accountant? Clearly, it makes a great deal of sense to
replace as much alphanumeric data as possible with numeric data. For example,
warehouse bin locations could be converted to numeric codes instead of the more
common Aisle A, Rack 3, Bin R style. Similarly, product codes should be purely
numeric. Also, don’t try to create different versions of an invoice, such as invoice
number 1234A. Further, avoid using transaction identifiers, such as a purchase
order that is coded as PO-45678. By focusing on using just numeric codes, an
accounting department can drastically reduce its keypunching error rates.

11-3 Use Multiple OCR Engines for Data Capture

A common efficiency technique is for accounting departments to digitize paper
documents with a scanner, allowing the documents to be accessible through the
corporate computer system. However, it is more difficult to go beyond storage of
the scanned image and also extract the data stored on the scanned images.

Most scanning systems come with built-in optical character recognition
(OCR) software that extracts data from digital images. Unfortunately, some
documents contain handwritten text or are damaged, resulting in incorrect
OCR interpretation, sometimes with laughably inaccurate results. An alternative
approach that spots these errors is a technological advancement on the old
technique of having two data-entry operators enter the same information, and
checking each other’s work for mistakes. In this case, two different OCR systems
can be used to interpret the same image, with differences between the two
interpretations being flagged for operator intervention.

In high-volume environments where manual intervention is not possible,
some multiple-OCR systems will instead assign an accuracy value to an interpreted
character, with the system storing the interpreted value having a higher score.
Thus, the OCR engines can vote for which interpretation is correct. This does not
mean that the resulting interpretation will actually be correct, but at least that the
one with the highest probability of accuracy was retained.

Please note that multiple OCR engines are only one aspect of high-accuracy
data interpretation. Other issues include the quality of the scanner, smudges and
background color on documents, and scan resolution levels.

11-4 Add Digital Signatures to Electronic Documents

One of the primary difficulties with converting paper-based forms to electronic ones
is that many documents require a signature to be affixed to them. This results in an


11-4 Add Digital Signatures to Electronic Documents 229

electronic form’s being printed out, signed, and then either scanned back into a
digital format or else used from that point forward as a paper document. As a result,
the multitude of benefits associated with digital documents—minimal storage costs,
infinite replication, ease of search, and so on—are lost. This problem has been
corrected through the passage of a federal law legalizing the use of digital signatures.

It is still unclear how the courts will rule on the multitude of variations that
can arise in relation to the type of digital signature used. At this time, it is quite
possible that a character-based name on a message will be sufficient, though
encrypted digital signatures that are much more difficult to duplicate will likely
become the norm.

As more companies take advantage of this law, we will see efficiency
improvements in all of the following areas:

¢ Customer orders. A customer order typically requires a signature by a
corporate manager, which is then hand-carried, mailed, or faxed to the
receiving company. Digital signatures can cut much of the delivery time
out of this process by sending orders by e-mail straight to the recipient, which
will greatly speed up the order fulfillment process. In addition, it reduces the
risk that an order will be lost (as is frequently the case when orders are faxed).

¢ Human resources. The human resources department is awash in documents
that require signatures—W-4 forms, I-9 forms, 401(k) forms, benefit forms,
and so on. By switching to digital signatures, a company could not only avoid
much of the physical paper flow that is currently needed but also reduce much
of the face-to-face time between human resources staff and other employees
that is now needed to complete paperwork. This could be replaced by a vastly
greater degree of automation that would convert the human resources staff
from paper processors to managers of the process.

¢ Legal documents. Many business agreements require the transfer of docu-
ments back and forth between the concerned parties, usually by expensive
overnight delivery service, to ensure that signatures are appropriately affixed
before the documents are finalized. This extra time period can be avoided by
the use of e-mail documents.

¢ Purchasing. The purchasing staff can issue purchase orders to suppliers by
e-mail, with full digital authorization, rather than having to laboriously print
out a purchase order, find an authorized signer for it, and fax or mail it to a
supplier. This improved process will greatly increase the speed and efficiency
of the purchasing department.

The exact type of digital signatures used will become more apparent as the
cost effectiveness and security of various solutions become more apparent in the

marketplace.

11-5 Archive Computer Files

Some companies have elected to use computer records as a direct replacement for their
paper documents. When this happens, they have certainly eliminated the majority (if
not all) of their filing work, but they have also put themselves at risk of losing
electronic documents if they are not archiving computer records. In a typical
organization, all records are purged from the computer system after one or two
years, usually because maintaining a larger online database will require an inordinate
amount of expensive storage space. However, purging these records runs counter to
the document-destruction policies noted later in best practice 11-11, “Adopt a
Document-Destruction Policy,” in which nearly all documents must be retained
for longer than one or two years. Consequently, storing all documents on a computer
system is not legally possible if the system is to be systematically purged of all records
from time to time.

The answer to the purging problem is to archive data before they are purged. This
means that the database must be transferred to some reliable storage medium. By
doing so, you can retrieve the back-up storage medium at some later date and review it
for data, extracting any electronic document needed. Though this may seem like a
simple matter of inserting an extra back-up tape into the daily computer back-up
procedure and then putting the extra tape in permanent storage, there are some extra
issues to consider. One is that back-up tapes are not especially reliable over many
years. The data on them will degrade. A better storage medium is a compact disc (CD-
ROM), though using it requires a company to purchase a special storage device that
will write onto the CD-ROM. Another possibility is to institute an automatic backup to
cloud storage, though the data transfer speed can be slow. The other main problem is
that the archived data may be in a format that will be unreadable a few years from
now—after all, how many companies today have equipment that can read data stored
on one of the old storage mediums from 20 years ago, such as paper tape or computer
cards? The answer to this problem is a difficult one. An option is to go back to all
archived data and convert them to whatever the current data language may be
whenever a company changes its systems, which is an expensive endeavor. As there
is no clear answer to these storage problems, a company may need to store data in
multiple file formats and carefully review the integrity of the data from time to time to
ensure that the files are still readable.

Carefully archiving all key computer files prior to purging them from the
primary computer system is a fundamental best practice necessary for a fully
digitized filing system to function properly.

11-6 Implement Document Imaging

Many companies find themselves in the situation of constantly searching for
files. Perhaps several departments need them at once and the files are constantly


11-6 Implement Document Imaging 231

shifted back and forth, resulting in no one’s being able to consistently locate
them. Also, some employees are better than others at returning files when they
are finished with them, while other companies just have a hard time obtaining a
qualified group of staff people who can reliably file documents in the right place.
Whatever the case may be, it is a common problem and one that can seriously
impact operations.

One answer to this quandary is to convert all paper documents into digital ones
and store them in the central computer system so that, potentially, all employees
can access them from all locations—and do so at the same time. Digital documents
have the advantage of never being lost (with one caveat, noted later in this section),
never being destroyed (as long as there are proper back-up routines taking place),
and being available to anyone with the correct kind of access. These are formidable
advantages and have caused many larger corporations to adopt this approach as the
best way to avoid the majority of their filing problems.

To implement a document-imaging system, you must first obtain a document
scanner with a sufficiently high throughput speed and resolution to allow scanning
a multitude of documents, as well as scanning with a sufficient degree of clarity to
obtain a quality digital image. This scanner must be linked to a high-capacity
storage device, usually one using multiple compact discs that is called a “CD
jukebox” and a file server containing the index file that tracks the location of all
digital documents stored in the jukebox. A number of terminals are also necessary
to link to this system so that users may access digitized documents from as many
company locations as necessary. A graphical view of this layout is shown in
Exhibit 11.2.

232 Filing Best Practices

There are some problems with digital document storage that make it useful in
only selected cases. One is cost—the entire system, especially the storage device,
can easily bring the total cost into the six-digit range, with high-end systems for
large corporations exceeding a million dollars. Also, there is a considerable
workload required to set up the system, for a large portion of a company’s
existing documents must be scanned into the system, as do new documents that are
generated every day. There is also an issue with legality, for it may be necessary to
continue to retain some paper documents, given the murky nature of the law
regarding the acceptability of digitized documents in a legal action. In addition, if a
document is not properly indexed when it is first scanned into the system (i.e.,
given an access code that allows a user to more easily find it), it is possible that
there will be great difficulty in later locating it in the computer; in effect, the
document is lost in the storage device. Thus, there are a number of issues to be
aware of before installing such a system. Generally speaking, the cost considera-
tion alone will keep smaller companies from implementing this solution, unless
they are in industries that require enormous amounts of paperwork, such as the
legal or medical professions.

11-7 Eliminate Stored Paper Documents if Already in Computer

Most companies store the bulk of their data in their computer systems and then
periodically print out records and file them away—even though all of the data still
exist in the computer system. Though an argument can be made that employees are
accustomed to handling paper documents more readily than digital ones, and that
computer systems are too unreliable to constitute the sole repository of informa-
tion, these are objections that can be overridden with the proper degree of training
and system changes. There are a number of other best practices that will make a
computer system essentially bombproof and therefore make it available for use
during normal business hours with very few exceptions. Those best practices,
which are described elsewhere in this chapter, are as follows:

¢ Archive computer files

¢ Avoid purging computer records

¢ Extend use of the computer database
¢ Improve computer system reliability
¢ Use document imaging

Once all or most of these best practices have been put in place, it is time to
implement the one described in this section—to eliminate any paper documents
already stored in the computer system. This is a step that must be completed with


11-8 Extend Time Period before Computer Records Are Purged 233

extreme care, for the computer system must be thoroughly proven to be fully
operational and virtually incapable of failure before the paper files are removed
from the corporate premises. The logical sequence of steps to follow for this
implementation is to wait for a sufficient period of time to pass to verify that the
computer system is thoroughly bombproof; then to shift all paper documents to an
off-site location so that they can still be called back in case of an emergency; and
then, after a longer interval, to completely eliminate those documents except the
ones required for legal purposes. This is a long implementation process that may
require several years to complete, but it is essential that the elimination of paper
documents does not interfere with the daily conduct of company business, which
can fail or be severely impacted if the conversion to digital documents does not go
as planned.

11-8 Extend Time Period before Computer Records Are Purged

An accounting department that relies on the data stored in its computer system to
handle day-to-day transactions has a problem when those records are purged. The
purging process usually occurs during the month-end or year-end closing process,
typically destroying all transaction records that are more than one year old. When
this happens, the accounting staff goes from having immediate access to all records
via their computer terminals to having to retrieve paper documents, frequently
from an off-site storage location. Clearly, this is a major reduction in the speed and
efficiency of the department as it relates to the retrieval of data.

The reason records are purged is that they take up a considerable amount of
space in the hard drive storage of the computer system. By purging old records
from time to time, it is possible to reduce storage requirements, which makes it
unnecessary to purchase additional storage devices. The best practice advocated
here is actually a set of variations on retaining some or all storage space, as noted:

¢ Delay purging old records. The most comprehensive way to avoid additional
filing work is to extend the period before which records will be deleted. For
example, an automatic purge after one year can be shifted to a purge after two
years. However, this policy will greatly expand a computer system’s storage
requirements, a serious consideration, especially when the purge period
extends so far back in time that there is a diminishing return on the usefulness
of the data in comparison to the cost of the extra computer storage. Though
this is the most common version of the best practice currently in use, it should
not extend storage too far back in time, given the high cost of doing so.

¢ Purge only selected files. Rather than purge all records, it may be possible to
purge only those files containing specific types of records. For example,
management may not feel that it is necessary to retain accounts payable


234 Filing Best Practices

records for more than one year, whereas it may want to retain sales records for
a considerably longer period. Accordingly, the best approach in this case is to
delete specific files regularly, while retaining others for longer periods. This is
an effective way to retain data in the system while spending less money on
computer storage. It is most effective when those files containing the largest
numbers of records (and thus the ones that take up the most storage space) are
deleted first, such as daily inventory transaction files.

¢ Purge only obsolete records. An approach that is even more selective than
purging specific files is to purge only specific records. For example, manage-
ment may decide to eliminate the records of all customers with which the
company has not done business for at least two years, while retaining the
records of all current customers for five years. It is usually a simple matter to
extract data from the database that clearly shows which customers can be
deleted, along with all associated information. This method is more labor
intensive than doing a blanket purge with a single keystroke, but it retains the
information that is most likely to be called into use.

¢ Use slower-access storage media. Large corporations that can afford the
expense may transfer older computer files to slower and less expensive
back-up systems still linked to the primary computer storage system. By
using this approach, they can allow fairly rapid access to data, even if the
data are several years old, by any employee with access to the computer
system. However, since the slower storage devices are still much more
expensive than simply purging data and leaving paper documents in a
warehouse, this is typically an option that is only explored by companies
with large computer system budgets.

Any of these alternatives will give the accounting staff better access to old
records, which allows them to avoid the onerous task of manually picking through
old files for needed records. When selecting one alternative over another, it is
necessary to determine the need for various kinds of records and to retain only
those for which there is a reasonable expectation that some data retrieval will be
needed.

Cost: SFIF Installation time:

11-9 Extend Use of Existing Computer Database

Whenever the person responsible for filing makes the recommendation to have
everyone access data directly through the computer system, rather than through
documents, the response is usually that not everyone has access to the system. That
is, some employees cannot access the correct files they need, they do not know how
to access the information, or they do not have access to the computer network in


11-9 Extend Use of Existing Computer Database 235

order to do so. In most cases, this is not an idle complaint; these people really will
not be able to function unless significant changes are made to the computer system.

This best practice is a mandatory one if online access to data is to take the
place of paper documents. It involves several steps that are needed to open up
access to the computer system. This is not an item that can be completed in
a haphazard manner, for it is too complicated to complete without using a rigid,
step-by-step approach, which is as follows:

1. Determine who uses information. Before opening up computer access to
employees, it is necessary to determine who needs the access. For example, it
makes no sense to provide computer terminals to everyone in a company,
only to discover that half of them do not have the slightest need for
information. Accordingly, interview all employees to see what they need
and determine where in the computer system that information can be found.

2. Calculate changes in access volumes. If the new system will result in a
massive increase in user access to the system, this should be calculated well
in advance, so the central computer system can be upgraded to handle the
extra workload. Additional software licenses may also have to be purchased
to cover the extra users.

3. Construct new interface screens. Some of the data that are needed, as
discovered in the first step, may not reside in one place in the computer
system and may require the construction of new screens in the computer that
bring all of the necessary data together for easier use. This can be a laborious
step with a large programming budget. It is also next to impossible to
complete if a company uses a packaged software system that is regularly
updated by the supplier, since each update will probably wipe out any
custom programming.

4. Determine type of access. Once all of the data have been clustered into the
appropriate groups for employee use, it is very important to determine who
gets to change the information. If some employees will not be allowed to,
they must be given read-only access rights in the computer system; these
rights may vary by screen and should be set up well in advance so this task
does not interfere with later implementation steps.

5. Add terminals. There may be a need for extra terminals so that all
employees have easy access to the system. This may require stringing
additional cable or the addition of broadband links to other locations for off-
site access. It is also important to ensure that there are enough printers
provided to meet the needs of the additional users.

6. Train employees. The last step before going live with the new system is to
train employees in how to use the computer system. This training should be
custom tailored to the exact needs of each group that will be accessing
different information in the system, and the employees should train on the


236 Filing Best Practices

terminals so they know exactly what to do. They should also be given one-
page summaries showing them how to access the information they need.

These steps can take quite a long time to complete and will require a
significant budget, so it is important to verify in advance that there is a reasonable
payback to the company from implementing it—either through reduced filing costs
or by improving the efficiency of the corporation as a whole.

11-10 Improve Computer System Reliability

Many of the recommendations in this chapter are based on the assumption that paper-
based documents can be eliminated by calling up their electronic counterparts in a
company’s computer system. However, many controllers find that this assumption
will not work, and it meets with great resistance throughout a company because the
computer system has a bad reputation for not being functional at all times. If the
system is down and there are no paper documents that are immediately available to
serve as back-up information, a company can literally stop functioning at once.

There are a number of steps that a company can take to improve the reliability
of its computer systems. As many as possible of the following actions should be
taken to improve system reliability. Though even one of them is helpful, the entire
group will go a long way toward creating a bombproof system that employees will
have confidence in. The best practices for improving system reliability are as
follows:

¢ Battery back-ups. A computer system will experience power failures from
time to time, as well as power spikes or brownouts. All of these problems
result in computer system crashes, which corrupt data and keep the system down
for long periods of time. This problem is an especially vexing one in a
manufacturing environment, where power spikes may occur when large
machinery is turned on in the same power grid as a company’s computer system.
The solution to this problem is a simple one—just install a battery back-up, also
known as an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) on all file servers or larger
computers, as well as every personal computer, terminal, router, and hub—in
short, everything attached to a computer network that requires electricity. By
doing so, a computer system can be completely protected from all power
fluctuations. Also, batteries will become worn out and fail over time, so it is
critical to have a battery replacement schedule in place designed to replace
batteries shortly before their scheduled failure dates.

¢ Disk mirroring. Some companies that cannot afford to have any system
downtime at all will use two primary computers to record all transactions,


11-10 Improve Computer System Reliability 237

rather than the more traditional single computer. Under this system, all
transactions are recorded by two computers that are linked together and
that mirror each other’s functions. If one of these computers develops a
problem, the other one takes over all processing and continues operating on its
own so that users have no idea that there is a problem. The damaged computer
can be repaired while the other unit continues to operate. Though this is a more
expensive approach, it guarantees a very high level of system reliability.

Emergency planning and testing. No matter how many precautions a
company takes, it is likely that there will be system crashes from time to
time. Rather than passively hope that these incidents do not occur, it is better
to develop a formal plan for how to deal with them before they happen. By
writing down the precise recovery steps to be followed, you can save a
significant amount of time in fixing systems. This plan can also be used for
practice; by scheduling periodic training sessions for recovering from system
crashes, you can determine the weak points in the emergency plan and fix
them before a real emergency occurs. By using this approach, a company can
keep system downtime to a minimum.

Redo cabling. Some employees have difficulty staying online with their
central computer systems. This is caused by poorly constructed network
cabling, which may in turn be caused by excessive cable lengths without
repeaters, cables running near power sources (such as machinery), or the
wrong types of cabling. In some cases, the best way to eliminate this problem
is to completely redo the cabling. This may require the installation of top-
quality, high-capacity fiber-optic cabling, as well as new hubs. Also, if there
are links to distant locations, it may be necessary to convert to a high-capacity
Tl phone line, which is much more reliable, although also much more
expensive to operate. By making these changes, a number of system reliability
problems can be eliminated.

Scheduled downtime. One of the most common employee complaints
regarding system downtime is that maintenance occurs during regular busi-
ness hours, rather than at other times. When maintenance, such as system
backups, testing, or software upgrades, is going on, other users cannot access the
system, which keeps them from performing their jobs. To avoid this problem, it
is very important to cluster standard maintenance work together in a batch and
run it automatically during low-usage periods, such as late at night. Similarly,
any other system work that may bring the computer system down must be
carefully scheduled to match low-transaction periods during the workweek,
such as just before or after the regular working hours, or during the lunch period.
The best way to ensure that these times are properly scheduled is to create a work
schedule for the computer department that identifies the periods when the
system must be brought down, so employees can be adequately prepared in
advance for these periods, and so additional planning can be done to ensure that
the downtime periods are kept to an absolute minimum.

¢ System testing. There is a saying that all systems have bugs in them—you just
may not have found them yet. This is a major problem if a company
implements a new system without proper testing. A rigid testing program
will ensure that new systems have the appropriate back-up systems, will
operate as promised, can handle large transaction volumes, and will handle
unusual transactions. If a new system successfully passes all of these tests,
then it can be put into service. If not, it must be fixed and tested again. Only by
rigidly adhering to tough testing standards can a company provide reliable
computer systems to its employees.

While all of the preceding system reliability improvements are being imple-
mented, it is extremely important to publicize the progress of the work. If the
improvements are undertaken quietly, employees may still be influenced by a long
tradition of system problems and their opinions will not be changed for a long time.
Instead, to more quickly bring employees to the point of accepting the computer
system as their primary source of documents, it is necessary to publicize current
system improvement projects, upcoming ones, and before-and-after measurements
that clearly show the improvement in system reliability. Advertising system
changes to employees is one of the best ways to get them to support a move
to eliminate paper-based back-up systems.

11-11 Adopt a Document-Destruction Policy

Many companies keep on storing more documents year after year because they
have no idea of when they are supposed to get rid of them. By default, they
typically remain in a heap in the back corner of the most distant warehouse, eating
up space that can be put to better uses. For companies that have been in operation
for many years, this can become a considerable burden due to the many years paper
has been allowed to accumulate, especially if management has a habit of
purchasing expensive filing cabinets in which to store old records, rather than
less expensive cardboard storage boxes.

One solution is to work with a company’s lawyers and certified public
accountants (CPAs) to construct a document-destruction policy similar to the
comprehensive one shown in Exhibit 11.3. The policy should take into account the
document-retention requirements of all federal, state, and local regulatory agen-
cies, always adopting the longest required retention period. Once this policy has
been completed, the existing pile of paperwork can be sorted through with an eye
to eliminating all items for which there is no legal reason to keep them. When
conducting this elimination process, however, it is important to keep all documents
for which there is no termination date whatsoever, such as corporate minute books,
titles to automobiles, or project files for special machinery built for customers.

Once a document-destruction policy has been created to eliminate unnecessary
paperwork, a common result is for a company to realize a significant savings in
storage space as well as filing cabinets, both of which may be sold off or used for

other more profitable purposes.

11-13 Eliminate Reports 241

11-12 Eliminate Attaching Back-up Materials to Checks for Signing

A common cause for extra filing work is that many check signers require back-up
documentation to accompany all checks presented to them for signing. They want
the extra information so they can tell exactly why a payment is being made. The
extra paperwork typically includes the complete packet of accounts payable
documents: the supplier’s invoice, the company’s purchase order, and receiving
documentation. To fulfill the wishes of the check signers, the filing staff must
extract the accounts payable items from files, attach them to checks, wait for the
checks to be signed, and then detach them from the checks and file them away
again. All of this movement of paper also raises the risk that documents will be
misfiled during the process of taking them out of files and then putting them back
in. When this happens, an inordinate amount of time may be required to locate and
refile the missing documents. These activities can take up a considerable propor-
tion of the filing staffs time.

The solution is to stop attaching accounts payable backup information to
checks about to be signed. Though this seems like a simple and obvious step, it can
be a difficult one to convince the check signers to agree with. By eliminating the
back-up materials, the check signers have no way of knowing what the company is
paying for. The best way to deal with this complaint is to set up control points
earlier in the accounts payable process so that the check signers are so comfortable
with the level of control that goes into creating a check, they no longer care about
what they are signing. Typically, the best control point is the purchase order. If no
checks are cut without a purchase order in hand approved by the correct manager,
there is no need for the additional control point of having one last review of the
back-up documents by the check signer. It can take some time for a good purchase
order control system to be implemented; it is especially important that all
exceptions be rooted out of the accounts payable system so that all payments
are authorized by a purchase order. The check signers may want proof of the
efficacy of the new system before they relinquish the back-up documentation, so
the controller should work with the internal audit staff to schedule a review of the
purchase order control system and make any changes that the auditors recommend,
in order to ensure that the new control system works properly. If these changes can
be made, there is no longer any need for back-up documentation for the check
signers, and a significant proportion of filing time can therefore be eliminated.

11-13 Eliminate Reports

Most companies are awash in reports. Typically, someone asks the accounting
department to generate a report, which it does—and continues to do for the
foreseeable future because no one has told it to stop doing so. The majority of these


242 Filing Best Practices

reports are really only needed once—perhaps to check on the profitability of a
specific product line, or the cost of a service, or the usage of some equipment. Even
though their usage is limited, the accounting department continues to churn them
out and distribute them because the recipients are not aware of the cost of creating
them. A further problem is the distribution of the reports. It is common for
someone who does not realize the expense of distributing a report to have it sent to
everyone in the company who might use it and to many who most certainly do not.
Over time, the accumulation of, in many cases, hundreds of reports and the
enormous distribution lists creates a startlingly large filing burden. Not only are
these reports stored in case someone needs them, but they are distributed, and it is
the job of the filing staff to do both things.

The solution to the reports problem is to reduce the number of reports as well as
the number of recipients, but the method of implementing this best practice is worth
some careful consideration. One approach is to simply stop distributing reports and
to see who complains. However, this is not a very astute political move by the
controller, since an abrupt halt to reporting can irritate the heads of any departments
who receive the information. Instead, it is better to use the following steps:

1. Issue a list of outstanding reports and distributions. Sometimes it is
sufficient to bring to the attention of other departments the extent of the
report list that is being used. If issued along with a list of report recipients, as
well as a plea from the controller to review the lists and cross out any reports
and recipients that are no longer needed, it is usually possible to put a
considerable dent in the accounting department’s reporting and filing chore.

2. Notify recipients of the cost of reports. If a simple notification of the
number of reports does not result in any significant change, it may be
necessary to notify management of the total cost of creating and issuing
those reports. If the cost is considerable, the management team may
authorize the elimination of several additional reports.

3. Combine reports. Once the report list has been pruned with the previous
steps, it is time to interview the report recipients and see what information on
each report is actually being used. It may then be possible to combine the
data on several reports, resulting in fewer reports that are really needed. For
many companies, these first three steps will bring about a sufficient reduction
in the number of reports without having to proceed to the final two steps.

4. Charge recipients for reports. If there are still a number of reports left to
produce, it may be necessary to charge back the recipients for the cost of both
creating and distributing the reports (with an extra charge for each additional
person who is sent each report). Incurring an expense for information almost
invariably will cause department managers to take a serious look at cutting
back on their use of reports, which bodes well for the filing staff.

5. Post reports on the computer network. This last option can be substituted
for the previous step of charging for report usage. This one allows the filing


11-14 Move Records Off-Site 243

staff to avoid all distribution work by posting electronic reports on the
computer network, where users can access it for themselves. This approach
may not work for some reports that do not convert readily to a readable
format for all computer terminals, nor is it available to those report recipients
who do not have a computer or access to one.

These steps, taken in the order presented, are usually sufficient to bring about a
drastic reduction in the number of reports being used and issued, which has a
correspondingly large and favorable impact on the quantity of filing work that can
be eliminated.

Cost: SS Installation time: 9

11-14 Move Records Off-Site

A controller can have an exceedingly inefficient accounting operation for no other
reason than the presence of an immense amount of records in the accounting area,
which makes it difficult to find a sufficient amount of operating space and renders it
difficult to find the most current information. Frequently, these records are kept
near the accounting staff on the erroneous grounds that there will be times when
they are needed and that it will be an exceptional hassle to recover them if they are
stored elsewhere. This is a particularly difficult problem if the accounting staff has
been in place for many years and is accustomed to having records kept close at
hand.

The solution is to review the dates of the records and move the oldest items to a
secondary location. The cutoff date for which records will be moved is usually for
anything that is not in the current year of operations. There may be a few cases
where additional records should be kept, such as records from the previous year
that the auditors might request during their annual audit. However, in general,
these records can be moved out with minimal impact on current operations.

The main objectors to this approach will be those staff members who have
grown accustomed to keeping files close at hand, but this objection will usually
recede over time, especially if a good index clearly identifies which storage box
contains which records so that retrieving paperwork is an easy affair. The resulting
benefits from the change will be a considerable increase in working space and less
need for expensive office space and fewer expensive filing cabinets. The best
improvement of all is that it contributes to overall efficiency, for the amount of
paperwork remaining will be so greatly reduced that it will be simple to determine
where the really crucial files are located, which reduces search time. Moving
records off-site is an excellent method for reducing occupancy costs and clutter in
the accounting area.

244 Filing Best Practices

11-15 Reduce Number of Form Copies to File

Over time, it is a common occurrence for a company to continually add to the
number of copies of printed documents. For example, an invoice that starts with
two copies—one for the customer and one for the company—may later have
another copy added so that invoices can be filed in numerical order, and perhaps
another copy so that the customer service department (or some other department)
can have an extra copy. These additional documents are usually added without
much thought to the consequences for the filing staff, which must put away all the
extra copies. Also, additional document copies result in more expensive docu-
ments (since there is more paper involved), as well as a more heavy-duty printer
that can punch through such a thick sheaf of documents (which can also bunch up
quite easily, causing a printer jam). Thus, a large number of document copies
results in a multitude of problems, not the least of which is a considerable increase
in the workload of the filing staff.

The solution is to reduce the number of copies. However, this is not a simple
matter of ordering new documents with fewer parts. Both costs and politics can
become an issue when implementing what appears to be, on the surface, a very
simple matter. The main cost is that there may be many documents still in stock
with extra copies. If so, it makes little sense to throw them all out. Instead, use them
up, throwing away the extra copies that are generated, and then order new
documents when the old ones are gone. The main problem is politics. If there
is an extra copy being generated, it is a good bet that someone in the company
asked for the extra copy and that person will not be happy when the copy is
eliminated. If the person who wants the extra copy is a highly placed manager, it is
unlikely that the change will go unnoticed or tolerated. Instead, if persuasion does
not work, it is probable that implementation will be impossible until that person
leaves the company or moves to a position having less influence over the decision.
Also, before eliminating a document copy, it is mandatory that the exact use of the
copy be clarified with all users to ensure that there is not a problem if it is no longer
printed.

Despite the number of possible problems, this is a best practice that can
usually be implemented at least in part and will result in immediate gains for the
filing staff in exchange for a moderate amount of implementation effort.

11-16 Use Carts for Portable File Storage

In a typical accounting department, all accounting records are stored in a bank of
filing cabinets. If an accounting employee is lucky enough to be located next to this
storage area, then a relatively short walk back and forth will be sufficient to access
information. The situation is considerably worse for someone located on the other


Summary 245

side of the department, who will benefit from a considerable amount of exercise,
given the total amount of mileage required to obtain files throughout the day.

While one solution is to shift individual cabinets closer to those most likely to
use the information within them, a more efficient option is to make available
several wheeled file storage carts. Employees can load these carts up with however
many files they expect to need for the next few hours, and shift them back to their
offices in a single trip. The time saved from reduced employee travel time can be
substantial.

The main problem with this approach is that employees may become overly
enthusiastic about taking large numbers of files, and so will create miniature
libraries in their cubicles that effectively put the files out of reach of other
employees. If this proves to be the case, institute a maximum time limit during
which files can be kept away from the main cabinet storage area.

Summary

This chapter covered two main categories of best practices for filing. One focused
on ways to reduce the amount of filing work needed, on the assumption that some
filing of paper documents must always be done. The second cluster of best
practices covered how to use a computer system as the logical storage location for
information, rather than a filing cabinet. This second alternative is the preferred
approach, since it gives everyone with computer access the ability to call up a
document without any risk of damaging or losing the information on the digitized
document. However, there are a number of steps that a company must take to
ensure that information is properly stored on its computer system and that the
system is sufficiently operational during working hours to act as a proper substitute
for a manual filing system. Thus, the best practices described in this chapter cover
the two main filing alternatives—the filing cabinet and the computer system.

Finance Best Practices

This book is primarily about improving the accounting function, not the finance
function. However, this area is commonly integrated into the accounting depart-
ment in smaller organizations, where the cost of a treasury staff cannot be justified.
Thus, this area becomes part of the accounting function, and so a limited set of best
practices are included here.

Only in one case is an expensive and time-consuming best practice listed—the
use of a treasury workstation. It is really only cost-effective for a larger company,
but is included here because it does such a good job of integrating and improving
on a number of rote treasury functions. It is highly recommended for those
organizations that can afford it, but its substantial cost should be carefully reviewed
before a decision is made.

This chapter begins with a short review of the level of implementation
difficulty for each finance best practice, and then moves on to individual discus-
sions of each one. There is no final section that describes how these items can be
used in concert, since these functions operate just as well if implemented
individually—there is little efficiency to be gained through overlapping finance
best practices.

is that you may find that a specific web site does not precisely match your

12-1 Use an Investment Strategy for Short-Term Investments 249

12-1 Use an Investment Strategy for Short-Term Investments

At the most minimal level of investment strategy, you can do nothing and leave
idle balances in the corporate bank accounts. This is essentially an earnings credit
strategy, since the bank uses the earnings from these idle balances to offset its
service fees. If a company has minimal cash balances, then this is not an entirely
bad strategy. The earnings credit can be the equivalent of a modest rate of return,
and if there is not enough cash to plan for more substantive investments, leaving
the cash alone is a reasonable alternative.

A matching strategy simply matches the maturity date of an investment to the
cash flow availability dates listed on the cash forecast. For example, ABC
Company’s cash forecast indicates that $80,000 will be available for investment
immediately, but must be used in two months for a capital project. You can invest
the funds in a two-month instrument, such that its maturity date is just prior to
when the funds will be needed. This is a very simple investment strategy that is
more concerned with short-term liquidity than return on investment and is most
commonly used by firms having minimal excess cash.

A laddering strategy involves creating a set of investments that have a series of
consecutive maturity dates. For example, ABC Company’s cash forecast indicates
that $150,000 of excess cash will be available for the foreseeable future, and its
investment policy forbids any investments having a duration of greater than three
months. You could invest the entire amount in a three-month instrument, since this
takes advantage of the presumably somewhat higher interest rates that are available
on longer-term investments. However, there is always a risk that some portion of the
cash will be needed sooner. In order to keep the investment more liquid while still
taking advantage of the higher interest rates available through longer-term invest-
ments, an alternative is to break the available cash into thirds and invest $50,000 in a
one-month instrument, another $50,000 in a two-month instrument, and the final
$50,000 in a three-month instrument. As each investment matures, the money can be
reinvested into a three-month instrument. By doing so, ABC always has $50,000 of
the invested amount coming due within one month or less. This improves liquidity,
while still taking advantage of longer-term interest rates.

Atranched cash flow strategy requires you to determine what cash is available
for short, medium, and long-term investment, and to then adopt different invest-
ment criteria for each of these investment tranches. The exact investment criteria
will vary based on a company’s individual needs, but here is a sample of how the
tranches might be arranged:

1. The short-term tranche is treated as cash that may be needed for operational
requirements on a moment’s notice. This means that cash flows into and out
of this tranche can be strongly positive or negative. Thus, return on
investment is not a key criterion—instead, the focus is on very high levels
of liquidity. The return should be the lowest of the three tranches, but should
also be relatively steady.


250 Finance Best Practices

2. The medium-term tranche includes cash that may be required for use within
the next 3 to 12 months and usually only for highly predictable events, such
as periodic tax or dividend payments, or capital expenditures that can be
planned well in advance. Given the much higher level of predictability in this
tranche, you can accept longer-term maturities with moderate levels of
volatility that have somewhat higher returns on investment.

3. The long-term tranche includes cash for which there is no planned opera-
tional use, and that can be safely invested for at least one year. The priority
for this tranche shifts more in favor of a higher return on investment, with an
attendant potential for higher levels of volatility and perhaps short-term
capital loss, with a reduction in the level of liquidity.

Portrayed graphically, the tranches would appear as noted in Exhibit 12.2.
The corporate cash balance should rarely decline into the long-term tranche, with
occasional forays into the medium-term tranche, while the cash level will vary
considerably within the short-term tranche.

An example of the numerical result of a tranched cash flow strategy is shown
in Exhibit 12.3, which assumes a baseline return to be the return on one-month
Treasuries, with a target of increased basis points (BPS) above that standard for the
medium-term and long-term tranches.

To engage in the tranched cash flow strategy, one should regularly review the
cash forecast, and adjust the amounts of cash needed in each of the three tranches.
Inattention to these adjustments could result in an unanticipated cash requirement
when the cash in the company’s long-term tranche is tied up in excessively long-
term, illiquid investments.

12-2 Use Invoice Discounting

Some organizations have few assets that can be used as collateral for a loan, other
than their accounts receivable. If so, consider contacting a finance company to set
up an invoice discounting arrangement. Under this approach, a company’s unpaid
accounts receivable are used as collateral for a very short-term loan from the
finance company. The lender can alter the amount loaned whenever the underlying
amount of receivables collateral changes. Under this arrangement, the company is
still responsible for collecting outstanding invoices, and customers do not need to
be informed of the arrangement with the finance company.

The net effect of invoice discounting is to accelerate the flow of payments
from customers, which can be critical in situations where profits are low or cash is
needed immediately for growth. However, this is not a viable alternative if the
company has already granted another lender a lien on all company assets—which
includes accounts receivable. If this is the case, the other lender must be persuaded
to grant a lien waiver for the accounts receivable so that the lien can be shifted to
the finance company that will provide the invoice discounting service.

Invoice discounting is considered one of the more expensive forms of debt,
since the finance company charges not just a high interest rate on the loan but also a
monthly servicing fee. On a long-term basis, the cost of invoice discounting may
prove to be too expensive for a business, unless its products and services have
sustainably high profit margins.

12-3 Sell Securities under the Regulation A Exemption

Regulation A is described in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC)
Rules 251 through 263 and provides an exemption from the securities registration


252 Finance Best Practices

requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, on the grounds that a smaller securities
issuance does not warrant registration. Regulation A allows exemption from
registration if the offering is no larger than $50 million in aggregate per year
(recently increased from $5 million under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups
[JOBS] Act). Of this amount, no more than $1.5 million can be attributed to the
secondary offering of securities currently held by existing shareholders; the
secondary offering cannot include resales by company affiliates if the company
has not generated net income from continuing operations in at least one of the past
two fiscal years. The exemption is restricted to American and Canadian companies,
and it is not available to investment and development-stage companies (such as
blank-check companies). Anyone using this exemption must also create an offering
circular, similar to the one that would be required for a registered offering.

There are a number of critical advantages to the exemption provided under
Regulation A. First, there is no limit on the number of investors, nor must they pass
any kind of qualification test (as would be the case under Regulation D, as
described next in best practice 12-4, “Sell Securities under the Regulation D
Exemption”). Further, there are no restrictions on the resale of any securities sold
under the Regulation. Finally, the key difference between a Regulation A offering
and a registered offering is the absence of any periodic reporting requirements.
This is a major reduction in costs to the company, and is the most attractive aspect
of the exemption.

In addition, and unlike a registered offering, the Regulation allows a company
to “test the waters” with investors in advance of the offering, in order to determine
the level of investor interest. To take advantage of this feature, the company must
submit the materials used for this initial testing of the waters to the SEC on or
before their first date of use. The materials must state that no money is being
solicited or will be accepted, that no sales will be made until the company issues an
offering circular, that any indication of interest by an investor does not constitute a
purchase commitment, and also identify the company’s CEO, as well as briefly
describe the business. The company can only “test the waters” until it has filed an
offering circular with the SEC and can only commence securities sales once at least
20 days have passed since the last document delivery or broadcast.

When a company is ready to notify the SEC of securities sales under this
regulation, it does so using Form 1-A. Once the form is filed, the company can
conduct a general solicitation, which can include advertising the offering, as long
as the solicitation states that sales cannot be completed until the SEC qualifies the
company’s preliminary offering circular. This preliminary document does not have
to include the final security price, though it should contain an estimate of the range
of the maximum offering price and the maximum number of shares or debt
securities to be offered. Advertising can state only where the offering circular can
be obtained, the name of the company, the price and type of security being offered,
and the company’s general type of business.

Although a company is permitted to advertise its offering as soon as Form 1-A is
filed, it must follow a specific procedure to conduct actual security sales. Once the


12-4 Sell Securities under the Regulation D Exemption 253

Form 1-A has been qualified by the SEC, the company must furnish an offering
circular to each prospective purchaser at least 48 hours prior to mailing a confirma-
tion of sale. If a broker-dealer is involved with the sale, this entity must provide a
copy of the offering circular either with or prior to the confirmation of sale.

If the information in an offering circular becomes false or misleading due to
changed circumstances or there have been material developments during the
course of an offering, the company must revise the offering circular.

Once securities sales are under way, the company must file Form 2-A with the
SEC every six months following the qualification of the offering statement,
describing ongoing sales from the offering and use of proceeds. In addition, it
must file a final Form 2-A within 30 calendar days following the later of the
termination of the offering or the application of proceeds from the offering.

The regulation has provisions that can disqualify a company from using it. It is
not available if a company has had a variety of disclosure problems with the SEC in
the past 5 years, or if the company currently has a registration statement being
reviewed by the SEC, or if any affiliates or the company’s underwriter have been
convicted within the past 10 years of a crime related to a security transaction.

12-4 Sell Securities under the Regulation D Exemption

A company can avoid the lengthy and expensive securities registration process by
using the Regulation D exemption. Securities can only be sold under the
Regulation D exemption to an accredited investor. An accredited investor is
one whom the issuing company reasonably believes falls within any of five
categories at the time of the securities sale:

1. A bank, broker-dealer, insurance company, investment company, or
employee benefit plan.

2. A director, executive officer, or general partner of the issuing company.

3. A person whose individual net worth (or joint net worth with a spouse), not
including home value, exceeds $1 million.

4. A person having individual income exceeding $200,000 or joint income with
a spouse exceeding $300,000 in each of the last two years, with a reasonable
expectation for reaching the same income level in the current year.

5. Any trust with total assets exceeding $5 million.

There are several additional types of accredited investors, and some restric-
tions on the accredited investor types just noted; please review Rule 501 of
Regulation D for more details. Nonetheless, the previous definitions describe the
primary types of accredited investors.


254 Finance Best Practices

The information that must be sent to accredited investors as part of the financing
is minimized if the issuing company is already meeting its financial reporting
requirements under the Exchange Act. Additional reporting requirements are
applicable if this is not the case. Please consult Rule 502 of Regulation D for
further details.

A Regulation D offering may span a number of months; if so, there may be some
question about which securities sales fall within its boundaries. The consideration of
a sale transaction as being integrated into a specific Regulation D offering is a
judgmental one. The following factors would lead to the presumption of integration:

© The sales are part of a single financing plan.

¢ The sales involve the issuance of the same class of securities.
¢ The sales are being made at approximately the same time.

© The same type of consideration is involved.

¢ Securities sales are made for the same general purpose.

Securities sold under a Regulation D offering cannot be resold without
registration. For this reason, the issuing company is required under Rule 502
of the Regulation to “exercise reasonable care to assure that the purchasers of the
securities are not underwriters...” To do so, the company must take the
following three steps:

1. Inquire of purchasers if they are acquiring the securities for themselves or for
other parties.

2. Disclose to each purchaser that the securities have not been registered and
therefore cannot be resold until they are registered.

3. Add a legend to each securities certificate, stating that the securities have not
been registered, and stating the restrictions on their sale or transfer.

12-5 Set Up Supply Chain Financing

A company may try to improve its working capital situation by negotiating for
longer payment terms with its suppliers. Of course, this simply shifts the working
capital burden to the suppliers who are effectively providing funds to the company.
If a supplier offers an early payment discount, then the company may make an
early payment, but now the supplier is losing a substantial amount on the discount.
Another problem is that suppliers tend to call the payables staff more frequently
about payment dates when payment terms are longer.

An alternative is supply chain financing. Under this solution, a company sends
its approved payables list to its bank, specifying the dates on which invoice


12-6 Obtain Cash through Crowdfunding 255

payments are to be made. The bank makes these payments on behalf of the
company. However, in addition to this basic payables function, the bank also
contacts the company’s suppliers with an offer of early payment, in exchange for a
financing charge for the period until maturity. If a supplier agrees with this
arrangement and signs a receivables sale contract, then the bank delivers payment
from its own funds to the supplier, less its fee. Once the company’s payment dates
are reached, the bank removes the funds from the company’s account, transferring
some of the cash to those customers electing to be paid on the prearrangement
settlement date, and transferring the remaining funds to its own account to pay for
those invoices that it paid early to suppliers at a discount.

This arrangement works very well for suppliers because they may be in need
of early settlement. In addition, they receive a much higher percentage of invoice
face value than would be the case if they opted for a factoring arrangement with a
third party, where 80 percent of the invoice is typically the maximum amount that
will be advanced. Also, the amount of the discount offered by the bank may be
quite small (much less than if the supplier were offering an early payment
discount), if the company is a large and well-funded entity having excellent
credit. Finally, the arrangement is usually nonrecourse for the supplier, since the
arrangement with the bank is structured as a receivables assignment.

The arrangement also works well for the bank, which has excellent visibility
into the company’s bank balances and cash flow history, and so knows when it can
offer such financing at minimal risk to itself. Also, it obtains fees from the company
in exchange for disbursing funds on behalf of the company.

This is also a good deal for the company, whose suppliers now have ready access
to funds. Further, since the bank is contacting suppliers with payment dates, they will
no longer make inquiries of the company regarding when they will be paid.

Supply chain financing is less useful when payment terms are relatively short,
since there is not much benefit for suppliers in being paid just a few days early.
However, it is an excellent tool when standard payment terms are quite long.

12-6 Obtain Cash through Crowdfunding

The JOBS Act has authorized the use of crowdfunding to raise cash. Under the
crowdfunding concept, a company can use social media and the Internet to raise a
maximum of $1 million per year. If the business is willing to provide investors with
its audited financial statements, then the maximum annual amount can be raised to
$2 million.

The JOBS Act requires that a business intending to use crowdfunding file an
initial notice with the SEC. Anyone choosing to invest with the company is limited
to the lesser of $10,000 per year, or 10 percent of their annual income. The
allowable percentage declines if an investor earns a smaller amount of income


256 Finance Best Practices

per year. Given the annual restriction on investors, a company will have to raise
funds from a large number of investors.

Crowdfunding should be of interest to investors, since their shares will be
exempt from registration with the SEC if the shares are held for at least one year; this
should make it easier for investors to eventually sell their shares to third parties.
However, the company is under no obligation to issue any information about itself on
an ongoing basis to investors, so there is a risk that investors will not learn of a decline
in company fortunes, which could impact the value of their shares.

12-7 Join a Barter Network

There are times when it is simply not possible for a business to obtain additional
credit by any means. The result can be an excessive focus on cost reduction, rather
than expanding the business, in order to conserve cash.

A possible option is to join a barter network. A business can trade its assets,
goods, and/or services to other parties through a barter network in exchange for
bartering dollars that it can use to acquire assets or services from other members of
the network.

Bartering is a good way to clear out excess assets from a business, or to use
excess staff time, which might not otherwise have been convertible into cash.
However, the market for bartering is not overly large, so the amount of cash
effectively made available by this means is relatively minor. Still, it can be a useful
tool for smaller businesses that would otherwise find themselves strapped for cash.

12-8 Automate Option Tracking

When a large number of employees have company options, either the finance or
human resources department will be the target of ongoing questions about the
vesting, valuation, and tax implications of these options. Because the tax laws
are so complex in this area, employees keep returning with follow-up clarifica-
tion questions, as well as to run what-if scenarios on what they should do under
various circumstances. Given a large number of employees with many option
grants, this can turn into a major drain on company resources. In addition, a
company runs the risk of giving bad advice to its employees, which may have
legal repercussions if employees using this advice lose money through the
exercise of options.

A solution for larger companies is to purchase an options tracking package,
which they can use alternatively as an in-house solution or as a featured service


12-9 Automate 401(k) Plan Enrollment 257

on the external site of an application service provider. An example of such software
is Express Options, which is sold by Transcentive, Inc. The system stores all options
information in a single database, allowing you to handle multiple grant types,
determine vesting schedules, track option exercises and cancellations, and provide
employees with tax-related information. It also calculates option valuations, exports
data to the company stock transfer agent, and provides a variety of reports for
regulatory purposes. By using Transcentive’s add-on product, Express Desktop,
employees can access such information about their options as portfolio valuations
based on different stock pricing assumptions, what-if modeling, transaction histo-
ries, and frequently asked questions. They can also place orders to exercise their
options through the system.

For this type of service, you can expect to pay a minimum of $15,000
annually, with the price exceeding one third of a million dollars per year for larger
installations. Given its cost, this best practice is most applicable to corporations
with at least several hundred option holders.

Cost: PIF Installation time:

12-9 Automate 401(k) Plan Enrollment

In smaller organizations, the accounting department is tasked with the manage-
ment of 401(k) plan additions, changes, and deletions. This is not an efficient
process, for someone must arrange for a meeting with each employee who has now
been working for the minimum amount of time, as specified in the plan docu-
mentation, explain the plan’s features to them, wait for them to take the plan
materials home for review, and, finally, enter the returned documents into the
system of the 401(k) provider. This is a lengthy and time-consuming process.

An alternative is to automatically enroll employees in the 401(k) plan. This is
also known as a negative election, since an employee must make a decision not to
be enrolled in the plan, rather than the reverse. This approach has the considerable
advantage of reducing the paperwork needed to enter a person into the 401(k) plan,
since it is done as part of the hiring process, along with all other paperwork needed
to set up a new employee.

There are only minor downsides to this best practice. With more employees in
the plan, there will be somewhat higher fees charged by the 401(k) service provider
(which are typically charged on a per-person basis). Also, there will still be some
paperwork associated with those employees who do make a negative election.
Finally, since the group of employees who tend to be added to the 401(k) plan
through this method are at the lower end of the income stratum, it is more likely that
they will want to take out loans against their invested funds, each of which calls for
more paperwork.

12-10 Grant Employees Immediate 401(k) Eligibility

The most common way to enroll employees into a company’s 401(k) pension plan
is to make them wait either 90 days or a year from the date of hire. This calls for the
maintenance of a list of dates for newly hired employees that must be watched to
ascertain when someone becomes available for this benefit. Then they must be
contacted and scheduled for a short lecture about how the plan works and how to
invest in it. Then they complete paperwork to enroll, which is forwarded to the
payroll department so that deductions can be made from their paychecks for
advancement to the 401(k) plan administrator. All of the steps can more easily be
compressed into the hiring process, as was just noted in best practice 12-9,
“Automate 401(k) Plan Enrollment.” However, the issue can be taken one step
further not only by completing all of the paperwork at the time of hire but also by
allowing immediate participation in the plan at the time of hire. This represents less
a matter of improved efficiency than of giving new employees a fine new benefit,
for they can begin investing funds at once, which may lead to a reduced level of
employee turnover.

The main problem is that new employees can impact a company’s ability
to pass pension plan nondiscrimination tests, especially if the new hires are at
low pay scales. If these new employees do not invest a reasonable proportion
of their salaries in the 401(k) plan, this can force highly compensated
employees to limit their plan contributions to less than the maximum amounts.
Nonetheless, if there is a perception that immediate eligibility for the plan will
improve the employee turnover rate, then this should be considered the
overriding issue.

12-11 Consolidate Insurance Policies

Insurance policies are frequently added to a company’s insurance portfolio in a
piecemeal manner. Someone on the management team decides that some addi-
tional coverage is needed to mitigate a perceived risk, and so an additional policy is
added—sometimes beginning at a different time of the year from the other policies
already in existence, and perhaps with different insurance companies. This can be
an expensive approach, for each insurer must factor in potential loss costs plus
operating expenses and profit—on each policy it issues.

A better alternative is to aggregate the policies with a single insurer.
By doing so, insurers can see that their administrative cost will be the same,
despite the much higher volume of insurance, and so they can reduce their
insurance prices. Also, there is little risk that claims will arise on every single
policy held, so the overall risk to the insurer declines—which in turn can reduce
prices yet again.


12-13 Renta Captive Insurance Company 259

This option is best used by large companies with large-dollar insurance
policies, since insurers will want their business badly enough to be willing to
reduce prices based on the factors just noted.

12-12 Obtain Advance Rating Assessments

A company with publicly held debt can never be sure about the change in its rating
by a major rating service after it has taken some significant action, such as an
acquisition or a major capital investment. If the rating agency decides after the fact
that the company’s action has downgraded the credit level on its debt, then the
reduced ranking may trigger a number of adverse financial items—such as a drop
in the market price of the debt in order to increase its effective interest rate, or
difficulty in obtaining additional debt at a reasonable price.

This problem can be overcome by using Standard & Poor’s Rating
Evaluation Service. This service allows a company to obtain a confidential
review of its credit rating by a Standard & Poor’s analyst, who will issue a
prospective credit rating based on the proposed action. This is a particularly
valuable service when a company has a range of action items to choose from and
is willing to change its strategic direction based on which action results in the
best credit rating. Since the ratings derived by Standard & Poor’s are based on
prospective actions that may never be implemented, the ratings will be kept
confidential until such time as the company makes its plans public. Examples of
possible activities that could require a prospective credit analysis are asset sales
or divestitures, stock buy-backs, mergers or acquisitions, financial restructur-
ings, recapitalizations, expansions into new lines of business, and modifications
to the corporate legal structure.

The primary difficulty with this best practice is the considerable fee required to
have these analyses performed. The fee charged will increase for each additional
strategic option a company wishes to have analyzed, so having a broad range of
possible actions reviewed will be expensive.

12-13 Renta Captive Insurance Company

Companies are having increasing difficulty obtaining reasonably priced insurance of
all types, if they can obtain insurance at all. Captive insurance companies have been
used to provide access to insurance. They are run by a single company, an association
of companies, or by an entire industry in order to solve particular insurance problems.
Though the use of captive insurance companies has been a longstanding option for


260 Finance Best Practices

obtaining at least some of the necessary insurance, this option has required extensive
legal analysis, incorporation costs, and significant initial capitalization fees that have
limited their use. Also, sharing a captive with other companies has, until now, meant
that a company must share in the risks incurred by other companies, which can
present an uncomfortably high-risk profile.

Over the past few years, changes in the legal requirements for captive
insurance companies have brought about the creation of the rent-a-captive. Under
this legal structure, a captive insurance company has already been created by a
third party that rents it out for use by multiple companies. The structure is usually
in the format of “protected cells,” whereby each company using one can shield its
contributed capital and surplus from other renters that are also using the captive.
Not only does this format prevent a company from dealing with the initial start-up
costs of a captive insurance company, but it also allows it to retain any under-
writing profit and investment income from contributed funds. The company can
even recover a low-claim bonus at the end of the rent-a-captive contract, though it
can also be liable for additional claims payments that exceed its initial or
subsequent contributions into the captive. This format is especially useful for
those companies faced with moderate risks that have reduced their frequency of
claim incurrence. Conversely, it is less useful for companies seeking catastrophic
coverage or that have high volumes of small-claim activity.

The creators of rent-a-captive insurance companies usually charge a percent-
age fee of premiums paid into the captives in exchange for their use, while some
also take a share of the investment profit. This option is cost effective for those
companies paying at least half a million dollars in insurance expenses per year.
You should pay for up-front legal advice on both the applicability of this approach
and the tax deductibility of contributions made into a rent-a-captive.

12-14 Use Netting to Reduce Foreign Exchange Settlements

A company that regularly conducts business in multiple countries must spend a
considerable amount of time settling foreign exchange transactions. It may buy and
sell the same currencies many times over as it processes individual payables and
receivables. There are three ways to reduce the volume of these transactions,
depending on the number of parties involved:

1. Unilateral netting. A company can aggregate the cash flows amongst its
various subsidiaries to determine if any foreign exchange payments
between the subsidiaries can be netted, with only the (presumably) smaller
residual balances being physically shifted. This reduces the volume of
foreign exchange cash flows, and therefore the associated foreign
exchange risk.


12-15 Install a Treasury Workstation 261

2. Bilateral spreadsheet netting. If two companies located in different
countries transact a great deal of business with each other, then they can
track the payables owed to each other, net out the balances at the end of each
month, and one party pays the other the net remaining balance.

3. Multilateral centralized netting. When there are multiple parties wishing
to net transactions, it becomes much too complex to manage with a spread-
sheet. Instead, the common approach is to net transactions through a centralized
exchange, such as Arizona-based EuroNetting (www.euronetting.com).
Under a centralized netting system, each participant enters its payables
into a centralized database through an Internet browser or some other file
upload system, after which the netting service converts each participant’s
net cash flows to an equivalent amount in each participant’s base currency,
and then uses actual traded exchange rates to determine the final net
position of each participant. The exchange operator then pays or receives
each participant’s net position and uses the proceeds to offset the required
foreign exchange trades.

Each type of netting arrangement can involve a broad array of payment types,
covering such areas as products, services, royalties, dividends, interest, loans, and
hedging contracts.

When bilateral or multilateral netting is used, the parties usually sign a master
agreement that itemizes the types of netting to be performed, as well as which
contracts or purchase orders are to be included in the arrangement.

Although netting can be a highly effective way to reduce foreign exchange
transaction costs, some governments do not recognize the enforceability of netting
arrangements, because they can undermine the payment rights of third-party
creditors. Consequently, consult a qualified attorney prior to entering into a
netting arrangement.

12-15 Install a Treasury Workstation

The multitude of treasury-based transactions can take up a large part of the
finance staff’s workday and is highly subject to error. These tasks involve
management of a company’s cash position, investment and debt portfolio, and
risk analysis. The normal approach to these tasks is to track, summarize, and
analyze them on an electronic spreadsheet, with manual input derived from all of
the company’s banks and investment firms on a daily basis. In addition, any
changes resulting from this analysis, such as the centralization or investment of
cash, must be manually shifted to the general ledger. Given the highly manual
nature of these tasks, this frequently results in errors that must be corrected


262 Finance Best Practices

through the bank reconciliation process. A treasury workstation can greatly
reduce many of these work steps.

A treasury workstation is a combination of hardware and software that
will manage cash, investments, debt issuance and tracking, as well as provide
some risk analysis functions. It is an expensive item to purchase, typically
ranging from $30,000 for a bare-bones installation to $300,000 for a fully
configured one. The difference between these prices is the amount of func-
tionality and bank interfaces added to the treasury workstation—if a buyer
wants every possible feature and must share data with a large number of
financial suppliers, then the cost will be much closer to the top of the range.
Given these costs, this best practice is not cost effective for companies with
sales volumes under $50 million. Also, because of the large number of
interfaces needed to connect the workstation to other entities, the installation
time can range from one to nine months.

Why spend so much money and installation time on a treasury workstation?
Because it automates so much of the rote finance tasks. For example, if an
employee enters an investment into the system, it will create a transaction for the
settlement, one for the maturity, and another for the interest. It will then alter the
cash forecast with this information, as well as create a wire transfer to send
the money to an investing entity. Here are some of the other functions that a
treasury workstation can perform:

¢ Bank reconciliation. It can do the bulk of a bank reconciliation, leaving just a
few nonreconciling items to be resolved by an employee.

¢ Cash forecasting. It can determine all company cash inflows and outflows
from multiple sources in order to derive a cash forecast.

¢ Cash movement. It can originate electronic funds transfers.

¢ Debt tracking. It can follow short-term debt with a link to a dealer-based
commercial paper program.

¢ Financial exposure. It can identify and quantify financial exposure.

¢ Foreign exchange. It can determine a company’s cash positions in any
currency.

¢ Investment tracking. It can track and summarize a company’s investment
positions in money markets, mutual funds, short-term and fixed-income
investments, equities, and options.

¢ Risk analysis. It allows an employee to use it as a giant calculator, performing
what-if analyses with yield-curve manipulation and scenario analysis.

Based on this lengthy list, it is evident that a large company can derive a
sufficient benefit from a treasury workstation to offset its substantial cost.

12-16 Connect to the SWIFT Network 263

12-16 Connect to the SWIFT Network

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT)
operates a worldwide network that banks use to exchange standardized electronic
messages that are known as SWIFT MT codes. The SWIFT network is highly
secure and is designed strictly to transport messages between participants—it does
not provide a clearing or settlement service. By accessing the SWIFT network, a
company can streamline a number of treasury transactions, which makes the entire
system more cost effective to operate.

Companies are now able to access the SWIFT network by any one of four
methods:

¢ Standardized Corporate Environment (SCORE). Under this approach, a
company can communicate with all member banks in a closed user group.
Companies allowed to use this method must be listed on selected stock
exchanges in specific countries, which include most of Western Europe, North
America, and some countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Asia.
SWIFT invoices companies directly for their message traffic. This is the most
efficient method, because users have direct access to nearly all banks.

¢ Member-Administered Closed User Group (MA-CUG). A company can
join a separate MA-CUG for each bank with which it wishes to communicate.
Each MA-CUG is administered by a bank, rather than SWIFT. The bank
running each CUG will invoice member companies for their message traffic.
This approach may call for membership in multiple MA-CUGs, which is less
convenient than the SCORE method. However, it is available to all types and
sizes of companies.

¢ Alliance Lite. SWIFT has made this method available to smaller companies
having low transaction volumes. It allows them to use either a manual
browser-based payment entry system or to integrate directly into their treasury
management systems.

¢ SWIFT bureaus. Third-party providers have set up their own access to the
SWIFT network, and allow companies access through their systems for a per-
transaction fee. This approach avoids the need for any in-house systems
maintenance, but connectivity to any in-house treasury management systems
is likely to be limited.

In none of these access methodologies is a company allowed to deal directly
with another corporation; it can only send messages through bank intermediaries.

Access to the SWIFT network is important for larger companies, because they
can link their treasury management systems directly into the SWIFT network. By
doing so, they avoid having to establish individual interfaces with the reporting
systems of all the banks with which they do business, and instead can rely on a
single standard messaging format to initiate transactions with and acquire infor-
mation from bank accounts all over the world.


264 Finance Best Practices

Each SWIFT MT code used to send messages within the SWIFT network
contains a standard set of information fields. Thus, a different SWIFT MT code
is used for each type of transaction. For example, a company can issue an
MT 101 to move funds, an MT 104 to debit a debtor’s account, an MT 300 for a
foreign exchange confirmation, an MT 320 for a loan confirmation, and an
MT 940 to request bank account information. Given the high degree of
standardization, these messages can be automatically generated by a company’s
treasury management system and transmitted through SWIFT, while all incom-
ing messages can also be dealt with by the treasury management system in a
highly automated manner.

In summary, there are multiple ways for a company to gain access to the
SWIFT system, which it can then integrate into its treasury management system.

12-17 Optimize the Organization of Treasury Operations

A large multinational company typically became large at least in part through
acquisitions, which leaves it with a complex set of banking relationships and
accounts, as well as a highly dispersed treasury management group that resides in a
multitude of locations. This results in the inefficient use of cash, which in turn
reduces interest income and does not allow a company to pay down the optimal
amount of debt.

These problems can be mitigated by implementing regional treasury manage-
ment centers, usually one per continent. By doing so, the treasurer can concentrate
those treasury staff with the highest levels of expertise in the same locations, while
also achieving a much higher level of control over the underlying cash pooling and
foreign exchange transactions, not to mention better clerical tracking of any
resulting intercompany loans. By concentrating activities into this smaller number
of regional treasury centers, the treasurer can also more easily obtain online access
to the overall status of cash flows for the entire company.

The price of this increased level of efficiency is a considerable amount of
resistance by individual companies within the corporate conglomerate, since local
controllers and chief financial officers will be reluctant to hand over the adminis-
tration of their cash flows to a regional center that is outside of their control. Also,
such a high level of cash management calls for centralized information flows that
can only be provided by a companywide enterprise resource planning system,
which is an extremely expensive system to purchase and install. Consequently, the
multinational optimization of treasury activities is so expensive that it is a
reasonable option only for the largest companies.

12-18 Hedge FX with Forward Exchange Contracts 265

12-18 Hedge Foreign Exchange with Forward Exchange Contracts

Under a forward exchange contract, which is the most commonly used foreign
exchange (FX) hedge, a company agrees to purchase a fixed amount of a foreign
currency on a specific date, and at a predetermined rate. This allows it to lock in the
rate of exchange up front for settlement at a specified date in the future. The
counterparty is typically a bank, which requires a deposit to secure the contract,
with a final payment due in time to be cleared by the settlement date. If the
company has a credit facility with the bank acting as its counterparty, then the bank
can allocate a portion of that line to any outstanding forward exchange contracts
and release the allocation once the contracts have been settled. The forward
exchange contract is considered to be an over-the-counter transaction because
there is no centralized trading location and customized transactions are created
directly between parties.

For example, Toledo Toolmakers has a 100,000-euro receivable at a spot rate of
1.39079. Toledo can enter into a forward FX contract with a bank for 100,000 euros
at a forward rate of 1.3900 so that Toledo receives a fixed amount of $139,000 on
the maturity date of the receivable. When Toledo receives the 100,000-euro
payment, it transfers the funds to the bank acting as counterparty on the forward
FX contract, and receives $139,000 from the bank. Thus, Toledo has achieved its
original receivable amount of $139,000, even if the spot rate has declined during
the interval.

The price of a currency on the maturity date (its forward price) comprises the
spot price, plus a transaction fee, plus or minus points that represent the interest rate
differential between the two currencies. The combination of the spot rate and the
forward points is known as the all-in forward rate. The interest rate differential is
calculated in accordance with these two rules:

1. The currency of the country having a higher interest rate trades at a discount.
2. The currency of the country having a lower interest rate trades at a premium.

For example, if the domestic interest rate is higher than that of the foreign
currency, then forward points are deducted from the spot rate, which makes the
foreign currency less expensive in the forward market. The result of this pricing is
that the forward price should make the buyer indifferent to taking delivery
immediately or at some future date. Thus, if the spot price of euros per dollar
were 0.7194 and there was a discount of 40 points for forwards having a one-year
maturity, then the all-in forward rate would be 0.7154.

The calculation of the discount or premium points follows this formula. The
six-month U.S. dollar money market rate is 2.50 percent and the six-month euro
money market rate is 3.75 percent. The USD/EUR exchange rate is 0.7194. The
number of days in the forward exchange contract is 181. Because the euro
interest rate exceeds the dollar interest rate, the dollar is at a premium to the euro.


266 Finance Best Practices

Thus, the USD/EUR forward exchange rate exceeds the spot rate. The premium
is calculated as:

0.7194 spot rate x.0125 interest differential x (181/365 days) =
.0045 premium

The premium is therefore 45 points, which results in a USD/EUR forward
exchange rate of 0.7194 + 0.0045, or 0.7239.

There are a few problems with forward exchange contracts. First, because they
are special transactions between two parties, it can be difficult to sell them to a third
party. Also, the transaction premium offered may not be competitive.

Another problem is that the arrangement relies on the customer paying the
company on or before the date when the forward FX contract matures. To continue
using Toledo Toolmakers in an example, its terms to a European Union customer
may require payment in 60 days, so it enters into a forward contract to expire in
63 days, which factors in an allowance of three extra days for the customer to pay.
If the customer does not pay within 63 days, then Toledo still has to deliver euros
on that date to fulfill its side of the forward contract.

12-19 Hedge Foreign Exchange with Currency Futures

A currency future is the same as a forward exchange contract, except that it trades
on an exchange. Each contract has a standardized size, expiry date, and settlement
rules. The primary currency futures center with substantial volume is the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange (CME). The CME offers futures trading between the major
currencies, as well as some of the emerging market currencies. However, the
volume of contracts in the emerging market currencies is quite low.

These contracts are normally handled through a broker, who charges a
commission. There is also a margin requirement so that the buyer may be called
on to submit additional funds over time if the underlying futures contract declines in
value. Part of this margin is an initial deposit whose size is based on the contract size
and the type of position being acquired. All futures contracts are marked to market
daily, with the underlying margin accounts being credited or debited with the day’s
gains or losses. If the balance of the margin account drops too far, then the contract
buyer must contribute more funds to the margin account. If the buyer does not update
the margin account as required, then it is possible that the position will be closed out.

Since currency futures have standard sizes and expiry dates, it is quite likely that
a futures hedging strategy will not exactly match the underlying currency activity.
For example, if a company needs to hedge a projected receipt of 375,000 euros
and the related futures contract only trades in units of 100,000 euros, then the


12-20 Lock in Interest Rates with an Interest Rate Swap 267

company has the choice of selling either three or four contracts, totaling 300,000
and 400,000 euros, respectively. Further, if the projected currency receipt date
varies from the standard futures contract expiry date, then the company will be
subject to some foreign exchange risk for a few days. Thus, the standardized
nature of currency futures contracts result in an imperfect hedge for users.
For example, Toledo Toolmakers ships product to a German customer in
February, and expects to receive a payment of 425,000 euros on June 12. Toledo’s
chief financial officer (CFO) elects to hedge the transaction by selling a futures
contract on the CME. The standard contract size for the EUR/USD pairing is
100,000 euros, so Toledo sells four contracts to hedge its expected receipt of
425,000 euros. This contract always expires on Fridays; the nearest Friday
following the expected receipt date of the euros is on June 15, so Toledo enters
into contracts having that expiry date. Because the standardized futures contracts
do not exactly fit Toledo’s transaction, Toledo is electing not to hedge 25,000 euros
of the expected receipt, and it will also retain the risk of exchange rate fluctuations
between its currency receipt date of June 12 and its currency sale date of June 15.

12-20 Lock in Interest Rates with an Interest Rate Swap

The interest rate swap is an agreement between two parties (where one party is
almost always a bank) to exchange interest payments in the same currency over a
defined time period, which normally ranges from | to 10 years. One of the parties is
paying a fixed rate of interest, while the other is paying a variable rate. The variable
interest rate is paid whenever a new coupon is set, which is typically once a quarter.
Fixed interest is usually paid at the end of each year.

By engaging in a swap, a company can shift from fixed to variable payments,
or vice versa. Thus, if a company uses a swap to shift from variable to fixed interest
payments, it can better forecast its financing costs and avoid increased payments,
but loses the chance of reduced interest payments if rates were to decline. If it takes
the opposite position and swaps fixed rates for variable rates, then it is essentially
betting that it will benefit from a future decline in interest rates. An interest rate
swap is especially useful for a company with a weak credit rating, since such
entities must pay a premium to obtain fixed-rate debt. They may find it less
expensive to obtain variable-rate debt and then engage in an interest rate swap to
secure what is essentially a fixed-rate payment schedule.

The parties to an interest rate swap deal directly with each other, rather than
using a standard product that is traded over an exchange. They customarily use the
standard master agreement that is maintained by the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (www. isda.org). The ISDA represents participants in the


268 Finance Best Practices

privately negotiated derivatives industry, and maintains standard contracts for
derivatives transactions. The parties commonly modify a variety of features within
the agreement to suit their needs.

For example, ABC Company borrows $10 million. Under the terms of the
agreement, ABC must make quarterly interest payments for the next three years
that are based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which is reset
once a quarter under the terms of the borrowing agreement. Since the interest
payments are variable, the company will experience reduced interest payments if
LIBOR declines but will pay more if LIBOR increases. ABC’s management is
more concerned about the risk of LIBOR increasing, so it eliminates this risk by
entering into an interest rate swap in which it agrees to pay interest for three
years on $10 million at a fixed rate, while its counterparty agrees to make
floating interest rate payments for three years on $10 million to ABC. The first-
year payment stream for the transaction is shown in the following table, where
the counterparty makes quarterly payments to ABC, which vary based on
changes in LIBOR. ABC makes a single fixed interest rate payment to the
counterparty at the end of year one. The result of these transactions is that ABC
experiences a net reduction in its interest expense of $20,000 in the first year of
the swap agreement.

 

Applicable

December 31 4.25% 4.65% 116,250 $425,000
Totals $445,000 $425,000

 

The CFO should arrange for payments under an interest swap agreement to be
as closely aligned as possible with the payment terms of the underlying debt
agreement. Thus, it is not useful if a counterparty’s payment to the company is
scheduled to arrive several weeks after the company is scheduled to pay its bank
under a loan agreement. Instead, the counterparty’s payment should be scheduled
to arrive just prior to the due date specified in the loan agreement, thereby better
aligning the company’s cash flows.

Summary 269

Summary

The best practices in this chapter tend toward the needs of a more advanced
treasury department rather than a smaller accounting department. Nonetheless, the
controller of a smaller business may be called on to use some of these techniques
when there is no treasurer. If so, the use of invoice discounting and Regulation A or
D fundraising are likely to be the most useful options for raising funds. Of the risk
management best practices, a controller will find that the consolidation of
insurance policies and optimizing treasury operations will probably be the
most useful alternatives to implement.

Financial Statements
Best Practices

This chapter covers the best practices that can be used to issue financial statements
more rapidly. This creation process can be one of the most convoluted and time
consuming of all activities, with a long time needed to complete a quality set of
statements. When a long interval is regularly required to complete financial
statements, it has two significant impacts: not allowing any time for the accounting
staff to complete other activities, and an irate management team that never receives
its information on time. These are serious problems that can be completely
eliminated by the best practices noted in this chapter.

The primary purpose of the more than two dozen improvement suggestions in
this chapter is to streamline the entire process of financial statement production.
This is done in a variety of ways, such as completing some tasks before the end of
the month, avoiding the bank reconciliation, and automating the month-end cutoff
process. Most of these steps are simple ones and can be quickly and easily inserted
into the existing process. A few, however, such as automating the period-end
cutoff, require a significant amount of extra work and may carry some risk of
providing imperfect financial information. Consequently, it is necessary to review
each recommended best practice carefully and only use those that will most easily
be inserted into the existing system without causing either a stoppage in financial
statement production or a reduction in their quality.

This chapter begins with a brief analysis of the level of implementation difficulty
for each of the best practices and proceeds to a detailed review of each one.

Implementation Issues for Financial Statements Best Practices

This section notes the relative level of implementation difficulty for all of the best
practices that are discussed later in this chapter. The primary source of information
is contained in Exhibit 13.1, which shows the cost and duration of implementation
for each best practice. For this group of improvements, the table makes it clear that,
in most cases, changes are of little duration, easy to implement, and have little or no
cost. The reason is that most alterations are confined to a small number of people
within the accounting department, which makes it easier to alter the tasks of just
that small group. Also, these are mostly procedural changes, ones that do not
require expensive and problematic computer programming alterations. Further,
there is little need for the participation of other departments. Thus, for all these
reasons, the risk and investment associated with most of these best practices are
low.

The two glaring exceptions are automating the period-end cutoff and using
inventory cycle counting to avoid month-end inventory counts. In the first case,
there is a need for programming; and in both cases, the complete cooperation of the
warehouse staff is required. Given these two additional variables, these best
practices become not only the most expensive and time-consuming ones to
implement but also the ones most likely to fail.

13-1 Move Operating Data to Other Reports

A major factor in the delay in completing financial statements is the inclusion of
operating data in the statements. The reason is that this information, such as scrap
rates or employee turnover, is not contained in the financial information that the
accounting staff normally deals with, nor is it readily obtained by creating ratios or
comparisons of the financial data. In short, this information can be hard to obtain.
The situation is worsened by the lack of control of the accounting staff over who
tracks the information, as well as its accuracy once it is obtained. For example, a
subsidiary may forward information about its customer backlog that seems
suspiciously high; the controller has the options of including the provided data
in the financial statements or of holding off on the financial statement distribution
while requesting and waiting for a review of the numbers by the subsidiary—
which is under no obligation to do the review. Thus, including operating data in the
financial statements not only can delay the issuance of the statements but also does
nothing to ensure the accuracy of the operating information.

An easy way to avoid these problems is to separate all operating information
from the financial statements so the statements can be issued in a timely manner,
with the operating information sent out later in a separate document. By using this
approach, there are fewer steps to complete when issuing financial statements,
leaving fewer steps to delay the overall process. Also, if there are problems with the
operating data, the controller can review the information at his or her leisure and

13-2 Restrict the Level of Reporting

Over time, many older companies have gradually gotten into the habit of demanding
(and receiving) immensely detailed financial statements from the accounting
department. Besides the usual balance sheet and income statement, as well as
departmental reports, there can be a plethora of additional schedules, such as sales by
customer or region, inventory levels by type of inventory, and a complete activity-
based costing analysis of every customer. Though some of these reports may be set
up to run automatically as part of the regular package of financial statements (and
thereby requiring no additional work), other reports may require the transfer of
information to a different format, such as an electronic spreadsheet, for further
analysis and regrouping into a customized report. In this case, the amount of time
required to assemble and independently prepare the reports may exceed the time
needed to create the primary financial statements. Thus, the more reports included in
the financial statements, the more time it takes to issue the statements.

The solution is to make a list of all the reports included in the financial
statements, ignore those that are automatically created by the accounting software,
and focus on eliminating or delaying those that are created separately. It may be
possible to strip these reports out of the basic financial reporting package, allowing
the accounting staff to issue the basic underlying statements much more quickly. To
achieve this goal, it may be necessary to explain to management that the reports will
no longer be provided at all (which is normally not received well). Other variations
are to issue the reports separately and at a later date, or to issue them less frequently,
such as once a quarter or year. Usually, there is some combination of methods that
will be agreeable to management, thereby allowing a controller to restrict the level of
reporting in the financial statements to only the most basic information.

Management may take a better view of this reduction in the information
provided if the controller or chief financial officer (CFO) makes it known that,
while information will be delayed, other information will be provided more
frequently in order to meet the operating needs of the company. For example,
the accounting department could promise daily access to information about
changes in revenues, discounts given to customers, and expenses, and weekly
access to changes in headcount information. By providing this information so
rapidly, it reduces the negative impact of restricting some information from the
financial statements, while also providing a service by issuing key information
even sooner than it had previously been issued.

13-4 Create a Disclosure Committee 275

13-3 Write Financial Statement Footnotes in Advance

Many footnotes accompany a well-documented set of financial statements.
These typically include an executive summary, notes on the accounting meth-
odologies, the amount of long-term debt (as well as the years in which it comes
due), a commentary on insurance coverage, any customers with a high prepon-
derance of a company’s sales, and a historical comparison of the current results
to prior years. Depending on the number of footnotes added to the financial
statement package, this can be a considerable amount of work to update every
period.

The solution is to separate them into two categories: boilerplate information
that is rarely changed, and information that is closely linked to current financial
results, requiring a great deal of updating. All footnotes in the first category
should be clustered together to the greatest extent possible, reviewed prior to the
end of the month, and even printed out and ready for inclusion with the
remainder of the financial statements. By handling these items well in advance,
there is less work to be done during the crucial period immediately following
the end of a reporting period, when there is little time available for such work.
Unfortunately, many footnotes do require updates based on current financial
results and so cannot be completed in advance. In these cases, it is still possible
to highlight those portions of each footnote that must be changed, either with
different font sizes, underlining, or color changes in the computer, so that
everything requiring examination can be spotted and checked easily. In addition,
it is a good idea to create a checklist containing all of the data to be updated in
each footnote. This checklist is an excellent way to avoid situations where
footnotes are distributed that have not been updated to account for the most
recent results.

13-4 Create a Disclosure Committee

Auditors have become increasingly sensitive to the completeness of financial
statement disclosures, especially in the areas of potential commitments for which a
company may be liable. The problem for company management is that the
employees who may be creating these commitments (especially in the purchasing
and legal departments) probably have no idea that their activities require disclo-
sure. This is less of a problem in smaller, centralized companies where informal
communication channels keep everyone apprised of ongoing activities, but can be
a significant problem in larger firms where employees are widely distributed and
communication systems are accordingly more difficult to maintain.

A solution is to assemble a disclosure committee, made up of representatives
from every department whose employees are likely to create transactions requiring


276 Financial Statements Best Practices

some form of disclosure. This group does not have to meet in person very
frequently, but they should be encouraged to share information at regular intervals
regarding their departments’ activities. Further, every member of the group should
be kept up to date by the accounting staff regarding changes in disclosure
requirements, as well as the details of the disclosures currently being made.
This approach not only improves the comprehensiveness of disclosures, but is also
useful for correcting and updating existing disclosures.

13-5 Automate Recurring Journal Entries

The average financial statement many require several dozen journal entries
before it is completed. Some of these entries can be quite large, perhaps to
redistribute payroll costs to a large number of departments or to allocate
occupancy costs in a similar manner. If they are substantial, it is easy to
incorrectly enter them occasionally, resulting in revenues and expenses being
sent to the wrong accounts, making the financial statements very difficult to
compare from month to month. If the journal entries have been highly
inconsistent over time, it may even be necessary for the general ledger
accountant to review all of them and create new journal entries to correct the
original entries. All of this work takes time, of course—and time is in short
supply during the financial statement closing process.

Many general ledger accounting software packages have a feature that allows
you to avoid the continual reentry of journal entries every month by setting up
recurring journal entries which the system will automatically generate every
month, with no further manual interference. This type of entry is only for those
situations where the exact amounts of the entries do not change from month to
month (e.g., for the allocation of occupancy costs), so it will apply to only a portion
of the total number of journal entries. Nonetheless, by setting up recurring entries
in the computer, there are fewer journal entries to make.

The only problem with using recurring entries is that they will change at
long intervals, necessitating a periodic update. To use the earlier example,
occupancy costs may be reallocated based on changes in the square footage
occupied by each department, so the closing schedule should include an annual
review and updating of the amounts used in this entry. Another way to update
recurring entries is to create a schedule of entry updates, so a controller knows
the exact month or year in which a recurring entry is scheduled to change and can
ignore it in the meantime. Either approach gives a sufficient amount of control
over this type of journal entry, while still reducing the total amount of
accounting time allocated to it.

13-6 Automate the Cutoff 277

13-6 Automate the Cutoff

The single most difficult issue at the time of each financial statement closing is the
cutoff. This involves matching the invoices from suppliers with receipts to ensure
that all expenses carry with them a corresponding benefit within the same period.
The main problem in this area is the cost of goods sold, where large quantities of
goods are received every day, usually comprising the bulk of all expenditures. Ifeven
a single high-value delivery is recorded in the wrong period, the cost of goods sold
can be off significantly, either too high, because an expense is recorded without the
corresponding receipt, or vice versa. To exacerbate the problem, the incorrect entry
will reverse itself in the following accounting period, resulting in a continual
fluctuation in the cost of goods sold, one period being too high and the next too
low. This can be very embarrassing for a controller and is a grave matter for publicly
held companies, which can be sued by shareholders for incorrectly reporting
financial results. To avoid this problem, most controllers allocate an inordinate
amount of staff time to the comparison of accounts payable and inventory records.

To avoid the entire cutoff problem, it is absolutely mandatory that a company
strictly adhere to a policy of turning away from the receiving dock any deliveries
that do not have an accompanying purchase order number. By closely following
this policy, it is possible to entirely automate the period-end cutoff. By immedi-
ately logging in all receipts against purchase orders in the computer system, it is
possible to generate a computer report comparing all inventory receipts to the
purchase orders entered into the computer system, as well as all received supplier
invoices that match up against the purchase orders. This report yields a complete
list of all receipts for which there are no supplier invoices, making it easier to
accrue for all missing invoices. This carries with it the double benefits of not only
avoiding the manual labor of determining a clean cutoff but also eliminating the
wait time that would otherwise be required before supplier invoices arrive.

Unfortunately, there are several problems with this excellent approach that
limit a controller’s ability to install it. First, it requires the cooperation of the
computer services and warehousing departments—the first to program the changes
needed to make it run in the computer system and the latter to agree to reject all
items without purchase orders, as well as to enter all receipts in a computer at the
receiving dock. Whenever additional departments are involved, the chances of
completion drop, since there are more supervisors who can interfere with it. Also,
due to the programming needs, this is an expensive implementation (unless there is
already a packaged software solution on hand that contains the appropriate
features). Further, the purchasing department must be persuaded to enter all
purchase orders into the computer system in a timely manner. All of these issues,
particularly the involvement of multiple departments, make this a difficult and
expensive best practice to implement, though it is also one of the most rewarding
ones to have in place.

278 Financial Statements Best Practices

13-7 Avoid the Bank Reconciliation

The last item completed before issuing financial statements is usually the bank
reconciliation. A company’s bank takes a few days to compile bank statements for
all of its customers following the end of the month, then a few more days pass
while the statement travels through the mail. The typical company then receives it
on about the fifth business day of the month, and someone in the accounting
department must scramble to complete the bank reconciliation. Usually, there are
bank fees noted on the statement that must be recorded on a company’s books, as
well as any unrecorded checks (always manual ones that were never entered into
the computer system) to be recorded. Because of the delay built into receiving the
statement and the time needed to complete the bank reconciliation, many compa-
nies cannot reduce the time needed to complete their financial statements to less
than five or six days.

The solution is to not include the bank reconciliation in the month-end closing
procedure. By doing so, there is no need to wait for the bank statement to arrive,
nor is there any last-minute rush to complete the bank reconciliation.

However, there is a significant risk to consider, which is that there is an
expense located on the bank statement that, if not recorded, will have a major
impact on the level of reported profits in the financial statements. For example, a
large manual check representing a major expense is listed on the bank statement
as having been processed; this check will eliminate all monthly profits when
recorded in the general ledger. This possibility is the main reason many
controllers insist on waiting for the bank reconciliation to be completed before
they will consider issuing financial statements. Luckily, there are several steps
you can take to reduce this risk. One is to accrue banking fees. These are usually
about the same amount each month and so can be accrued and then reversed after
the actual bank statement arrives. Second, one can call the bank and advance the
date on which the bank statement is issued, say to the 25th day of the month,
which allows the accounting staff to complete the bank reconciliation much
sooner, though there is still a risk that the final few days of the month may
contain an unrecorded expense that will not be found until the following month’s
bank statement. Also, the outside auditors will object to a bank statement that
does not extend to the last day of the month, so the final statement of the year
must be converted back to the traditional month-end variety. Third and best, the
accounting staff can subscribe to its bank’s online transaction review system
(assuming it has one), which allows someone to review all checks received
every day and to maintain a running bank reconciliation. By using this final
approach, the bank reconciliation is always perfect and all expenses are spotted
on the same day they are recorded by the bank. As a result, there is no need to
worry about unexplained expenses appearing on the bank statement and the
reconciliation can safely be shifted out of those few frenzied days when the
financial statements are being produced. Though any of the three variations
noted in this paragraph can be used, only the last one is a completely foolproof

current expense.

13-8 Defer Routine Work

An accounting department is usually overwhelmed by its ongoing volume of work,
without the extra crushing load of creating and distributing the periodic financial
statements. Many of these tasks, such as payments to suppliers, invoicing to
customers, daily or weekly reports to management, or the processing of cash, are
vital ones, and cannot be delayed for long. As a result, the accounting staff is
accustomed to working long overtime hours during the first week of each month,
not to mention a blackout on vacation time during this period. Also, the following
week is sometimes a frenzied one as well, since the accounting department must
catch up on the necessary work it did not have a chance to complete in the previous
week. In short, producing the financial statements is a hard lump for the accounting
department to swallow.

The solution is to carefully review the tasks currently scheduled for comple-
tion during the first week of the month and see if there are ways to eliminate them
or shift them into a later week. For example, management may be accustomed to
receiving a daily report of sales and cash receipts; it may be possible to completely
eliminate this report for a few days during the beginning of the month so that the
workload is completely eliminated, rather than being shifted into the next week.
Completely avoiding work is always the best option, but for some tasks, there is no
alternative to shifting it forward a few days. Examples of this kind are paying
suppliers or billing customers—this must be done, but a judicious delay of a few
days will not do an excessive amount of harm to these basic processes. However,
there may be a few cases, such as invoicing very large dollar amounts or paying
suppliers in order to take a large early payment discount, where it pays to go ahead
with the work in the current period, but only for key items; the remaining smaller
items can still be deferred for a short time. This solution is an easy way to reduce
the amount of overtime required to complete the financial statements.

13-9 Eliminate Multiple Approvals

A typical problem when financial statements are produced is to have employees
wait for approvals before they are allowed to complete their tasks, or to pass along
work to other employees, who cannot begin until the approvals are given. When
there are many approvals to obtain, especially in areas where the approvals are


280 Financial Statements Best Practices

holding up key work products, there can be a substantial impact on the speed of
financial statement completion. Typical spots in the financial statement process
that include approvals are journal entries, footnotes, the final version of the
statements, and the final results from all of the major accounting modules: accounts
payable, accounts receivable, payroll, and fixed assets. Given the number of
approvals in some companies, it is a wonder that the financial statements are ever
produced in less than a month.

There are several solutions that bypass the approvals problem. When review-
ing them, consider the underlying reason for using approvals, which is to ensure
that information is correctly processed. Without an approval, there must be a
countervailing system in place to ensure that accurate information is still trans-
mitted to the financial statements. Some solutions are as follows:

¢ Designate a back-up approver. If there is a continuing problem with finding
the person who is allowed to issue approvals, then there should be a back-up
approver available. This should still be a person who has a sufficient level of
technical expertise, and so this solution is only a viable option for those
companies with some extra employees on hand who are sufficiently qualified.

¢ Increase training levels. An excellent way to avoid approvals is to train the
accounting staff in the closing procedures so that they all become experts in
their jobs. After heavy and repeated training, it is quite common to find that the
staff is more technically proficient in their tasks than their bosses, with little
need for any approval. Also, newcomers to the accounting department must
receive similarly high levels of indoctrination.

¢ Issue ranges within which approvals are not required. The best way to
handle the approval problem is not to require approvals at all. To do so,
determine the comfort level of the controller in regard to how much an
accountant is allowed to do without any supervisory review. For example,
establish a limit of $2,500 for any journal entry, above which approvals are
still required. This approach usually eliminates the bulk of the approvals,
while still reserving the oversight privilege for those transactions large enough
to truly warrant a review. This method usually requires a periodic review of all
transactions to ensure that the preset ranges are being observed.

© Reduce to one approver. In cases where there is more than one approver,
there is rarely a need for it. For example, if a journal entry for more than
$5,000 must be approved by an assistant controller, but anything over $25,000
requires the approval of the controller, it is usually sufficient to give the
assistant controller a much higher signoff authority, reserving only the most
unusual situations for the involvement of the extra person. If a controller still
insists on requiring a secondary review of all approvals, then either the
controller is a certifiable micromanager (which may require counseling) or
else the person issuing the first approval is not sufficiently qualified to give it
(in which case he or she should have no approval authority at all).


13-10 Eliminate Small Accruals 281

¢ Shift the approver to an available person. A common occurrence is that a
high-ranking person is the only one allowed to approve certain transactions. If
that person frequently travels or is in meetings, then a process cannot be
completed until the person becomes available to give an approval. Conse-
quently, the best approach is to reassign the approval to a different person who
is always on-site, usually an assistant controller or accounting manager.

All of these approaches are targeted at reducing the processing time required
to track down a designated approver. Given a company’s individual circum-
stances, especially involving the risks of not approving a processing step, the
ultimate solution to this problem will be a mix of these options. The key issue to
remember is that some situations do indeed require some kind of supervisory
control, so there is always some approval requirement for at least a few key
deliverables.

13-10 Eliminate Small Accruals

In some companies, there is a focus on achieving perfectly accurate financial
statements, no matter how many extra accruals are needed. Though there is a
certain degree of professional satisfaction in issuing a set of absolutely accurate
financial statements, this can use up a considerable amount of accounting
resources, which could be better used elsewhere. For example, it may require
20 extra accruals, along with the attendant analysis, review, and approval effort, to
yield financial statements that now have a profit altered by one or two percentage
points. Realistically, such a slight change in the financial results will not have a
noticeable impact on the decision making of the managers, stock analysts, or
creditors who review the financial statements. So, despite an inordinate amount of
extra effort, no one really cares about the slightly more accurate results.

The answer is to review all existing accruals and throw out all of the ones
resulting in only very small accrual amounts. By doing so, less time is needed to
produce the financial statements, opening up resources for other uses. However,
when conducting the accrual review, it is important to check on a number of past
journal entries to ensure that each accrual is always a small one—if there is even
a slight chance of an accrual occasionally being a large one, it is best to keep it in
place on the grounds that financial statement accuracy could be severely
impacted by its absence at some point in the future. Thus, as long as an
appropriate degree of caution is used when eliminating accruals from the
financial statement closing procedure, it is reasonable to permanently eliminate
the use of small accruals.

282 Financial Statements Best Practices

13-11 Reduce Investigation Levels

Before issuing the financial statements, they are subject to an intensive review by
the controller, who compares each line item to the budgeted level and thoroughly
investigates each item that varies significantly from the budget. This is an
admirable and necessary practice, since it catches errors and also prepares the
controller for any questions from the management team regarding those same
variances. However, the practice can be taken too far. For example, it is almost
impossible for any revenue or expense line item to match exactly the budgeted
amount (unless it is related to a long-term contract that ensures totally predictable
amounts), so a controller who investigates virtually all variances will be doomed to
review every line item in the general ledger. This is an enormous task and also an
unnecessary one, for the vast majority of variances are so small that there is no
point in reviewing them—even if there is an error somewhere, the total impact is so
insignificant that there will be no noticeable impact on corporate profitability.
A very simple best practice that eliminates most of this review work is to
reduce investigation levels to the point where only the largest variances are
checked for accuracy. This can take several forms. For example, a minimum
dollar amount, such as $10,000, can be set for the amount of a variance that a
controller will bother to investigate. Alternatively, it can be on a percentage basis,
such as anything over a 30 percent variance. Also, there may be some accounts,
such as payroll, that are better reviewed by checking headcount figures each
month, thereby entirely eliminating them from the variance analysis. The best
approach is usually a combination of all three techniques, which means that
anything over a specific dollar variance is always reviewed, plus any large
percentage variances that may fall under the preset dollar level, with the exception
of certain accounts reviewed in other ways. This system can then be modified over
time to allow for changes in the controller’s comfort level with variance investi-
gation, as well as to cover new accounts that may be added. By creating such a
system of variance review levels, it is possible to greatly reduce the amount of
review work that must be completed prior to issuing financial statements.

13-12 Assign Closing Responsibilities

The typical financial statement preparation process can be a jumbled affair. It is not
clear who is completing which task or when anything needs to be completed. This
leads to disarray in the accounting department whenever the financial statements
are to be produced.

The solution is to produce a document that clearly states exactly who is
responsible for each task required to produce financial statements. As noted in
Exhibit 13.2, it states the job position that must complete each task. In order to

This reinforces the need for each person to complete each task exactly on

When combined with a detailed closing schedule, as described later in this
chapter under best practice 13-17, “Create a Closing Schedule,” a controller has
a complete set of documentation on hand for producing the financial statements.

13-13 Compress Billing Activities

When trying to achieve a fast close, many organizations find that the most
intractable problem is how to get billings done sooner. Most other closing tasks
can be shortened to a few minutes, but the problem with invoicing is that so much
is shipped (or services billed) at month-end that the process becomes clogged and
delays the closing. Here are five alternatives for improving the speed of the month-
end invoicing process:

1. Double up on invoicing labor. Have twice as many people work on the
month-end invoices. If this requires the use of less-trained staff, then have
them do the easy invoices and reserve the complex invoices for the regular
staff. This can be a problem if the accounting software has licenses for only a
smaller number of concurrent users.


284 Financial Statements Best Practices

2. See attached. If fully extended billing information comes from a separate
system and must be retyped into the billing software, then just put “see
attached” on the invoice, along with the grand total, and then staple the detail
to the invoice.

3. Roll-forward error corrections. If the underlying detail used to create an
invoice contains an error, then try to roll it forward into the next month’s
invoice, or just issue a separate invoice in a few days, after the close is
completed. The attitude should be that the first draft of an invoice will also be
the last draft of that invoice.

4. Cut and paste. If the billing information from another system can be
dumped into an Excel or flat file, then cut and paste it directly into the billing
software to save typing time.

5. Create custom reports. Picky customers may want invoices in a certain
format, which takes time to manually input. If these customers are likely to
be long term, then invest in the report writing time to create special billing
layouts just for them.

Of the five options shown above, the first three can be readily implemented,
while the final two tend to be useful only in more limited circumstances.

13-14 Conduct Transaction Training

Once the preliminary financial statements have been completed, the controller
must carefully review all expense, revenue, and balance sheet items to see if there
are unusual variances, investigate all of them, and make corrections that result in an
accurate financial statement. Depending on the number of errors and the time it
takes to research them, this error-checking phase can seriously extend the time
required before financial statements are produced.

One way to reduce the number of these errors is to conduct detailed transaction
training for all employees who have a role in entering transactions into the
computer system (typically a sizable group). The reason is that the controller’s
final review of the financial statements is only a method for removing errors after
they have already been made; by eliminating these errors before they happen
through proper training, the number of errors that the controller must later research
will drop dramatically.

The training must be very specifically targeted at eliminating recurring errors.
This is done through a feedback loop. All errors discovered in the financial
statements should be noted in a log, along with the name and position of the person
most likely to have caused the error. This information is reviewed each month, and
a short training program is created, targeted both at the specific person who made


13-15 Continually Review Wait Times 285

the mistake and the type of error that occurred; if the error appears to be a common
one for many employees to make, the training can be given to everyone who enters
the same transaction. Also, the training programs may be used to update the initial
training that all employees receive in transaction processing, thereby avoiding
errors in the initial training program. Mandatory reinforcement training is also
useful, both as a reminder for experienced staff and as a part of the core training for
new recruits, thereby keeping the focus on error reduction over the long term.

The main problem with this approach is the cost of training. If there are many
people entering transactions, the training required to cover all of them can be
considerable. In these cases, it may be necessary to scale back to a small number of
seminars per year, or else to issue bulletins describing problems, or to use online
training through the computer system. All of these approaches are less expensive
than comprehensive and frequent training but are also less effective. At worst,
there should be a follow-up program with the specific individuals who make errors,
so the worst offenders can be targeted for immediate improvement. Also, some of
the people who need training may work for other departments, so the controller
may have to exercise some tact in asking other department heads for permission to
repeatedly train their employees. However, these issues are minor ones, given the
benefits of reduced transaction error rates.

13-15 Continually Review Wait Times

A lengthy financial statement completion process has a number of spots built into it
where there are long wait times. For example, the typical company waits five days
before it receives a bank statement from the bank for each of its accounts necessary
to complete a bank statement. Also, there is usually a wait of a few days while
supplier invoices arrive, just to make sure that all expenses have been properly
recorded. It is pauses like these that make it nearly impossible to issue financial
statements in a rapid manner, no matter how quickly all other tasks are completed.
For example, it may be possible to blaze through a bank reconciliation in an hour,
but if one is still waiting five days to receive the bank statement, one is focusing on
the speed of the wrong activity.

The solution is a continual review of wait times. This focuses attention on
those activities a controller should really be attempting to reduce in size or
eliminate. To review wait times, the best tool is a Gantt chart. This shows the
typical start and stop dates for each closing activity. By closely examining the start
dates for each activity and questioning why those dates cannot be accelerated, it
brings attention to bear on any activities that are dependent on the prior completion
of other activities. However, this is only a tool for pointing out where there are
problems; it does not actually resolve them. To use the example from earlier in this
section, a Gantt chart will only tell a controller that there is a substantial wait


286 Financial Statements Best Practices

involved before all supplier invoices are received—the controller must still do
something about it (that particular item is addressed in best practice 13-6,
“Automate the Cutoff,” earlier in this chapter).

There are no problems with using this best practice, for it is easily imple-
mented, requiring only a brief review by the controller after each financial
statement closing to determine if there have been any wait-time changes. It
also needs no programming and does not involve other departments. In short,
it is a simple best practice to install and provides valuable information for the
targeting of further improvements.

13-16 Convert Serial Activities to Parallel Ones

A common problem, especially in smaller accounting departments, is that a
considerable amount of wait time is built into the process because there are too
many activities being conducted in a serial manner—that is, one process does not
start until another is finished. A good example is in a small organization where just
one person is in charge of completing several processing steps and does not have
time to advance to additional tasks until the first one is complete. The same
problem occurs in large organizations but usually not due to a lack of staffing.
Instead, the information that flows into one process must be supplied by another
task, so the preceding step must be completely finished before the next one can be
started. These issues create a great deal of difficulty in reducing the time needed to
complete financial statements.

The solution is to convert serial activities into parallel ones. A parallel activity
is one that can be completed without any need for data from a preceding process.
An example of several parallel closing activities is shown in Exhibit 13.3, which
depicts the accounts receivable, accounts payable, fixed assets, and payroll
processes. Only in one case, where the final detail of the accounts payable process
is needed as the starting point for the fixed assets process, is there any linkage
between the separate processes. The trick to making this best practice work is to
separate the individual processes that make up a financial statement closing so that
they can be independently processed. An example of this is using a preliminary set
of financial statements as the input into an allocation base from which occupancy
costs are allocated to various departments. By using older information in the
allocation base (see best practice 13-24, “Complete Allocation Bases in Advance,”
later in this chapter), there is no longer a linkage between the two processes, so they
can now be processed as parallel activities. Similarly, the accounts payable
function is not normally closed until several days have passed, while the company
waits for a few supplier invoices to arrive. This serial processing issue is readily
avoided by using computer systems and real-time entry of receipts at the ware-
house (see best practice 13-6, “Automate the Cutoff,” earlier in this chapter) to

13-17 Create a Closing Schedule

The worst enemy of a financial statement process is a disorganized closing.
Without a sufficiently detailed procedure, no one will know when any deliverables


288 Financial Statements Best Practices

are needed or if some deliverables are needed at all. Further, there is no sequence to
the process so some steps are waiting for the completion of previous steps that no one
is working on. For example, the accounts payable module must be completed before
anyone can complete the fixed assets module since it is possible to overlook last-
minute fixed asset additions if some of the accounts payable have not been entered. A
disorganized closing can drastically delay the completion of financial statements.

The solution is to create a closing schedule such as the one shown in
Exhibit 13.4. This schedule itemizes all tasks that must be completed during each

day of the closing process. By creating such a schedule, it is immediately
obvious when all tasks must be completed so that the controller can follow up
with employees and apply extra resources to those tasks that are falling behind
the schedule. Please note that a number of activities scheduled in Exhibit 13.4
should be completed prior to the end of the reporting period, leaving much less
work to do at the end of the process. This schedule is most effective when
combined with a schedule of responsibilities, such as the one noted earlier in
Exhibit 13.2. The two schedules can even be combined so that the name or title
of the responsible person is listed at the beginning of each activity in the closing
schedule.

The only issue with creating a closing schedule is that it is a constantly
changing document requiring regular updating and communication to the account-
ing staff. The reason for the regular updates is that the schedule will initially allow
for a substantial number of days before statements are completed, but management
will gradually shrink the number of days, requiring a constant reshuffling of tasks
and responsibilities. The accounting staff will only follow changes to the schedule
if the alterations are clearly communicated to them. In particular, the controller
must listen to their objections regarding a reduction in the time to complete tasks so
their requirements can be incorporated into the schedule. As long as these factors
are considered, the closing schedule becomes the foundation document driving the
timely completion of the financial statements.

13-18 Document the Process

Some organizations have created closing procedures and established responsibili-
ties for those accounting people who are involved with the production of financial
statements, which helps them to some degree in organizing the flow of work.
However, they meet with great resistance when they take the next step and mandate
reductions in the time needed to complete the statements. Employees grouse that
there is not enough time to complete their work, that upstream work is not
completed on time (which does not allow them to start their tasks on time), and that
management does not know all the details required to complete their tasks. As a
result, though the process appears to be more organized, there is no way to reduce
the time and resources allocated to it.

The underlying reason that this problem arises is that the employees are
right—the managers who are demanding shorter completion dates do not really
know the process and cannot understand the plethora of additional necessary
changes before the process will become truly streamlined. The only way to avoid
this quagmire is to document the process thoroughly. This means that a team
must interview all employees who are involved in the reporting process, write
down detailed descriptions of what they do, and flowchart all activities. Only


290 Financial Statements Best Practices

after these steps are completed can one see the bottlenecks in the process that
must be eliminated. For example, an employee may be using a painfully slow
allocation method for spreading occupancy costs, which can be easily altered by
switching to a simpler method—but a controller will never know this without a
complete documentation of exactly how the current allocation calculation is
made. The documentation process can be a slow one, especially for a multi-
division company including many employees and locations in the process.
Nonetheless, it is the only way to gain a better understanding of the process,
which leads to better decisions regarding how other best practices can be inserted
to ensure better results.

It is possible to short-circuit some of the documentation process. One
approach is to determine which people in the process are causing the obvious
bottlenecks, since the work piles up at their desks. Their work should be
documented and acted on first, while the efforts of others, whose work products
are clearly coming in on time, can wait until any changes alter the process enough
to make them the cause of the new bottlenecks. By using this variation on the
documentation process, it is possible to more rapidly institute changes to the
overall process.

13-19 Restrict the Use of Journal Entries

Journal entries can be the bane of the general ledger accountant who is
desperately trying to issue accurate financial statements. The reason is that in
the midst of cleaning up the general ledger in preparation for the issuance of
financial statements, this person will sometimes find that a journal entry has
miraculously appeared in the ledger, requiring a hurried investigation to deter-
mine who entered it, why it was made, and whether it was already duplicated by
the general ledger accountant. After this added work, there is always the chance
that even more entries will be made prior to the closing of the books for the
reporting period. A particularly irritating problem is when a journal entry is
made between the time when the financial statements are issued and the
accounting period is closed in the computer system, since the change appears
in the beginning balance for the next month, but does not show up in the financial
statements! These problems are caused by allowing multiple people to create
journal entries.

A much simpler approach is to restrict the task of making journal entries to a
single person, the general ledger accountant. Even the controller should not be
allowed to create journal entries. By using this approach, there is a single easily
controlled point of entry into the general ledger, ensuring that the information
entering the ledger has been verified in advance. The inevitable result will be fewer
problems with the production of financial statements.


13-20 Train the Staff in Closing Procedures 291

There are a few problems with this approach. Some accounting personnel will
probably complain that they are entitled to make journal entries, while there may
also be a problem if the general ledger accountant is not available at month-end to
make entries; if so, there should be a back-up person on hand authorized to handle
journal entries. Another issue for larger corporations is what to do if there are a
number of general ledger accountants, all of whom must make entries at the same
time, due to the volume of entries required. In this case, it is necessary to maintain a
log, either manually or in the computer, in which every accountant must record all
entries. By referring to other entries already in the log, any of the general ledger
accountants can easily see what entries have already been made and can thereby
avoid any duplicate entries. An alternative approach is to assign responsibility for
specific journal entries to certain general ledger accountants.

13-20 Train the Staff in Closing Procedures

One of the biggest problems with a new accounting staff, or one in which the
responsibilities for producing financial statements have changed recently, is that
they do not know what they are supposed to do. This results in a general level of
confusion regarding responsibilities, as well as the slow completion of deliverables
and their probable inaccuracy even when they are done. This is a nightmare
situation for a controller, who must review everyone’s work in great detail and
check on everyone’s progress to ensure that they will complete their assigned tasks
on time. This scenario is almost guaranteed to result in the late production of
financial statements, and probably ones with errors, as well.

A key factor that will reduce the level of confusion is proper training of the
accounting staff. By doing so, error rates will decline, while the time needed to
complete assigned tasks will drop dramatically. To achieve this end result, you
must first have an adequate set of procedures from which to conduct training (see
best practice 13-18, “Document the Process,” earlier in this chapter). Once these
procedures are written, use them to conduct personalized training of every person
who is involved in the creation of financial statements. It is important to conduct
training prior to the end of the reporting period so that the training can be done ina
leisurely manner, giving everyone time to ruminate over the information and to
have their questions answered thoroughly. If the training is conducted in the midst
of the closing process, there will not be enough time for an adequate level of
training. Also, once the initial training is complete, the controller must still monitor
the progress of all the people on the accounting team and provide follow-up
training as needed to ensure that they have fully absorbed what they have been
taught and that any errors are corrected. Finally, the procedures used as a training
tool must be given to the accounting staff for referral purposes, as well as being
updated at once to reflect any ongoing changes to the closing procedure. Training

13-21 Use Cycle Counting to Avoid Month-End Counts

A common effort for companies with poor inventory record-keeping systems is
to count the inventory at the end of every reporting period. By doing so, the
controller is assured of a reasonably accurate cost of goods sold figure, though at
the cost of shutting down the business while the counting process goes on
(since this may interfere with accurate inventory counts), which not only runs
the risk of losing some business but also requires paying some employees to
conduct the decidedly not value-added inventory counting activity. Over the
course of a year, this represents either a major loss of revenue, addition to
expenses, or both.

The solution is to stop taking periodic inventory counts. By doing so, there is
no stoppage of sales activities, nor is there any need to redirect activities to
counting inventory. In addition, the accounting staff no longer has to spend
valuable time during the end of the month to participate in the inventory count,
which gives them more time to complete the financial statements more quickly.
Unfortunately, this happy state of affairs brings with it some risks. The main one is
that inventory may become quite inaccurate over time, resulting in cost-of-goods-
sold numbers in the financial statements that will, over time, depart quite a long
way from the actual situation. If this number is inaccurate, the borrowing base
information a company presents to the bank will also probably be wrong, which
may give the bank grounds for withholding additional borrowings. A final problem
is that if the financial statements are incorrect, the controller may pay for this
oversight by losing his or her job.

The best way to avoid all of these issues is to use cycle counting. This
process involves a continual count of the entire inventory so that all items,
especially the high-value or high-usage ones, have their quantities verified
frequently. In addition, a trained cycle-counter is much more likely to obtain
accurate inventory figures than the less knowledgeable group of counters
typically employed for period-end counts. A good cycle-counter is trained
to investigate why there are counting variances, resulting in changes to the
underlying systems that originally caused the errors. By using this approach, it
is very unlikely that the inventory will be very far off at any time, which
gives a controller much greater confidence that the inventory figures at the
end of the month are accurate, without the need for a periodic physical
inventory count.

13-22 Compress Public Company Closing Activities 293

13-22 Compress Public Company Closing Activities

A publicly held company must take one additional step in the issuance of its
financial statements, which is to file those statements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). Unfortunately, the filing process requires the
involvement of several outside parties, which makes it impossible to close the
books in a single day. In fact, closing in a month can be considered a respectable
accomplishment. Here are some ways to reduce the duration of the public company
close:

¢ Quarterly auditor review or audit. The company’s external auditors must
conduct a review of the 10Q reports, plus a full audit of the 10K report. To
reduce the time needed for this activity, insist on the retention of experienced
audit staff on the company’s audit or review, give the auditors maximum
support by in-house staff, encourage the auditors to conduct preliminary
testing well in advance of the audit, increase the strength of controls in order to
avoid audit exceptions, and prepare detailed support for all disclosures
included in the 10Q and 10K reports.

¢ Quarterly legal review. A company’s legal counsel must review the 10Q and
10K reports to ensure that all legally mandated disclosures and supporting
schedules have been included. This review also searches for incorrect or
unsupportable statements made in the disclosures. Fortunately, the attorneys
are looking for different issues than those being reviewed by the auditors, so it
is quite possible to issue a review copy of the 10Q or 10K report to the
attorneys before the auditors have completed their work. Any changes made
by the attorneys can then be incorporated into the latest draft of the 10Q or
10K that the auditors are reviewing.

¢ Officer certification. Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act stipulates that
the CEO and CFO of a publicly held company must issue a written statement
with every financial statement issued, certifying that the information con-
tained within it fairly presents its financial condition and results of operations.
If these officers issue such statements knowing that the financial statements do
not present such information, then they can be fined up to $5 million and/or be
imprisoned up to 20 years. Given the penalties involved, they obviously want
some time to review the financials. This is not a significant problem because
both officers can review the financial statements while the auditors are
conducting their work. This gives them at least a week in which to read
and comment on the financial statements before there is any possibility of
filing the statements.

¢ Audit committee approval. The company’s audit committee must also give
its formal approval of the 10Q and 10K filings. The audit committee approval
meeting is set several days in advance, to coordinate the schedules of the
committee members. The group then discusses the report during a conference


294 Financial Statements Best Practices

call, the controller notes all recommendations made during the meeting, and
the accounting staff then creates an updated version of the report following the
call. There are a few ways to achieve minor time reductions. One possibility is
to issue a disclosure memo to the committee members well before they see the
financial statements. A disclosure memo itemizes the accounting issues that
the company is addressing in the current financial statements. If the committee
members are aware of these issues in advance, they will be less likely to
address them again during the committee meeting. Another possibility is to
issue the financial statements to the committee members before the supporting
footnotes and disclosures are released. The financial statements are usually
complete several days earlier, so the committee can see them as soon as
possible. Again, this leaves less material for discussion during the formal audit
committee meeting.

¢ EDGARizing. The SEC accepts 10Q and 10K filings through its Electronic
Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system. Companies filing
their reports with the SEC almost always forward them to a firm specializing
in the conversion of their reports into HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
or Extensible Markup Language (XML) (known as EDGARizing). The
specialist converts the statements to the required format and then files
them with the SEC on behalf of the company. Quarterly and annual filings
usually arrive at an EDGARizing firm from multiple companies at about the
same time, which can create a considerable backlog, and lengthens the time
required to file. The best way around this problem is to file well before the
SEC-mandated due dates so that there are fewer competing filings. Another
option is to retain the services of a smaller local EDGARizing firm, which will
be more likely to put greater emphasis on completing a company’s filings in a
timely manner.

13-23 Use Standard Journal Entry Forms

The production of a typical set of financial statements requires the entry of a
large number of journal entries. These must be made for a variety of reasons that
even the best-run accounting department cannot avoid, such as cost allocations,
accrued expenses for which a supplier invoice has not yet arrived, or the shifting
of an expense to a different account than the one into which it was initially
recorded. Recording each one of these entries can take a considerable amount of
time, for a great deal of thought must go into which accounts are used, their
account numbers, the amounts of money to be recorded in each account, and
whether there will be a debit or credit entry. Consequently, the use of journal
entries can take up a significant amount of the total time required to produce
financial statements.

Rent expense XXX
Utility expense XXX
Building maintenance expense XXX
Accounting Department occupancy expense XXX

Engineering Department occupancy expense XXX

One way to reduce the time devoted to journal entries is to create a standard set of
journal entry forms. These are used for the recording of standard journal entries
where the amount of money to be recorded will vary, but the account numbers will
stay the same most of the time. An example of such an entry is noted in Exhibit 13.5.
This type of entry is a common one and probably applies to a majority of the journal
entries every month. This type of journal entry standardization can be taken a step
further by creating recurring journal entries, which are used for any entries having the
exact same amount of money in the entry every time. For more information on this
approach, see best practice 13-5, “Automate Recurring Journal Entries,” earlier in
this chapter.

13-24 Complete Allocation Bases in Advance

A number of expenses must be allocated among departments. These can include
occupancy, telephone, insurance, and other costs. There is an allocation base for
each allocation. For example, occupancy may be based on the square footage
occupied by each department, while telephone costs are allocated based on the
number of employees in a department. For each allocation base, someone in the
accounting department must update all of the information based on the latest
financial results, prior to creating a journal entry to allocate the costs to various
departments. Because an allocation base usually includes the latest financial
information before a final cost allocation is made, it tends to be one of the last
action items the accounting department completes before it issues the financial


296 Financial Statements Best Practices

statements. Because it falls so late in the process, it can have a direct impact on the
total time required to issue financial statements.

The solution is a straightforward one—use information from the previous
month as an allocation base. By doing so, there is no allocation base to update in
the midst of the frantic release of financial statements. Instead, the update can be
completed at everyone’s leisure, since it does not have to be ready until the next
month’s financial statements are put together. In case there are any concerns
regarding the relationship between the previous month’s allocation base and the
current month’s expenses to be distributed, you can always release a study that
shows the (almost invariably) minor changes in the allocation base from
month to month. An alternative approach that may quash any fears of this
sort is to use a three-month averaging allocation so that any unusual variations
in the monthly allocation base can be spread out. The only remaining problem
is the outside auditors, who may insist on an allocation base that uses informa-
tion from the end of the year; if so, the allocation base can be updated for the
final month of the fiscal year, but the system can revert to a previous-month
system for all other months of the year. This is an easy way to shift some of the
workload away from the busy days immediately following the end of an
accounting period.

13-25 Reconcile Intercompany Transactions in Advance

In a multientity company, it is possible that the subsidiaries are transacting
business with one another. If so, there are likely to be an ongoing series of timing
mismatches in the books of the various subsidiaries, with the billing entities
recording invoices several days prior to when the receiving entities record the same
invoices. Also, some of the invoiced items may be in dispute so that the recorded
amounts differ. This can be a problem when the accounting records must be closed
at the end of each accounting period, since a considerable amount of time may be
required to research these items.

The most advanced solution is to have each subsidiary upload all of its
intercompany transactions to a central data repository as soon as it has recorded
these transactions in its own systems. The data repository aggregates all of the
transactions and shows the offsetting sides of each one, flagging any discrepancies.
A corporate reconciliation clerk can review the flagged items on a regular basis and
work with the billing and receiving entities to resolve their differences. Doing so
on an ongoing basis leaves fewer such transactions to investigate in the midst of the
closing process.

Summary 297

13-26 Conduct Daily Review of the Financial Statements

Sometimes the initial review of the period-end financial statements comes as quite
a shock—the revenues or expenses may be wildly off from expectations. This
results in a great deal of frantic research while the controller investigates possible
causes, rapidly makes changes, and issues bland statements to the rest of the
management team that the financial statements might be issued a bit late this
month. If the financials are indeed substantially different from what management
has been led to expect, the blame may even be pinned on the controller, who may
lose his or her job as a result.

The best way to avoid this problem is to conduct a daily or weekly review of
the financial statements. Yes, this means prior to the end of the month. By doing
so, a controller can review revenues as soon as they are billed, and expenses as
soon as they are incurred so that any obvious discrepancies can be resolved right
away. In addition, if there is a real problem with the financial results, the controller
will know about it immediately, rather than being taken by surprise at month-end,
which carries the additional benefit of being able to warn the management team
immediately, setting their expectations for the period-end financial results. Also,
by finding and correcting problems well in advance, there are hardly any issues left
to deal with by the end of the month, so the financial statements can be issued much
more quickly. Thus, an ongoing review enhances the controller’s knowledge of
how the financial statements are likely to appear and gives advance warning of
problems.

Many controllers would say that a daily review of the financial statements is an
excessive use of their time, since a review on each business day of the month piles
up into a formidable block of time. This is true, so the time must be used wisely.
For example, if there are repeated accounting problems with just the revenue-
recording part of the financial statements, it may be sufficient to review only the
sales each day. Similarly, if transactions are only posted into the general ledger
once a week, then the financial statements will only be updated once a week,
reducing the number of times when it is necessary to review the statements. Also, if
there are many minor problems throughout the financial statements, the daily
review chore can be assigned to a financial analyst, with instructions to only notify
the controller of major issues. By selecting a review interval that meets the needs
of the specific situation, a controller can reduce the amount of labor assigned to
this task.

Summary

This chapter covered a variety of techniques for improving the speed with which
financial statements can be distributed. These methods vary from shifting the work


298 Financial Statements Best Practices

of the closing process to before the end of a reporting period to avoiding some of
the closing work entirely. Most of the suggestions noted here will work in all
companies, irrespective of the closing systems they already have in place. A few
items require a careful appraisal of the current situation, however, such as avoiding
the completion of the bank reconciliation and using an automated cutoff system—
these require either special training or new computer systems and must be used
with an eye to the risk of system or training failures and their impact on the
accuracy of the financial statements. No matter which best practices are chosen
from the list in this chapter, one overriding issue remains constant—this is a
carefully choreographed dance of many people working together, requiring a good
manager to control. For more information about financial statements best practices

General Best Practices

There are a number of best practices that do not fall into any of the categories listed
in the other chapters of this book. These are all key areas that deserve special
attention to ensure that they operate properly. In particular, there are a number of
general management concepts that can be applied to accounting, such as the use of
run charts, value stream mapping, and production cell layouts. We also make note
of several taxation-related topics, including the use of tax liaisons and the
assignment of tax staff to business units. There are a number of other best
practices related to reporting, systems, and employee training. A review of this
array of best practices allows you to enhance a number of key activities.

Implementation Issues for General Best Practices

This section covers the general level of implementation difficulty that will arise
when installing the best practices discussed later in this chapter. This information is
primarily contained in Exhibit 14.1, which shows the cost and duration of
implementing each best practice.

The best practices noted in this chapter tend to require larger levels of
management time than those noted in other chapters, as well as a longer project
duration and higher cost. Examples of this are the consolidation of accounting
functions and switching to online reporting, which require a great deal of planning
and programming work, as well as (in the first case) the geographical transfer of
employees.

Even if these difficult best practices are excluded, the remainder will at least
require some advance planning, along with a week or more of work before they are
fully operational. The biggest problem with most is that they are systems—they
require their own procedures, training, and measurements to ensure that they work

properly. Examples of systems best practices are the continual review of process
cycles, training, and process centering. Due to the extra work required to create and
maintain an entire system, be aware of the time and effort needed before some
payback will be realized.

Finally, a few best practices are simple to initiate and complete, require
minimal management attention, and need only a modest amount of follow-up work
from time to time. These best practices include the creation of a contract terms
database, issuing activity calendars, and outsourcing tax form preparation. How-
ever, restricting your implementation of best practices to just these items would be
a mistake, for the level of accounting efficiency will rise dramatically when the
more difficult implementations are successfully completed.

The remainder of this chapter is grouped into sections, each of which covers
one best practice. In each section, there is a discussion of the problems that a best
practice can alleviate, how the best practice works, and any implementation
problems that may arise.

14-1 Apply Run Charts to Accounting Processes

Run charts are used to display process performance over time, and are an effective
way to visually spot trends and cycles in data. This is a high-level analysis, and it
must be followed up with a detailed review of the data to locate and correct
underlying causes. Run charts can also be used as a feedback loop to ensure that
changes made to a process have resulted in improvements.

The typical run chart, shown in Exhibit 14.2, itemizes events on the y axis and
the time period over which the events occurred on the x axis. As shown in the
exhibit, it is also useful to include a line, running parallel to the x axis, showing the
average for the events; anyone viewing the data can use the information to
determine the extent by which events have departed from the average. The
example shows a run chart for the average number of days to obtain approval
of supplier invoices, with a strong downward trend beginning in April, when the
company begins the rollout of an electronic workflow management system for
payable approvals.

Exhibit 14.2 Run Chart for Payables Approval Period

When reviewing a run chart, be aware that there is some normal variation in
the data, so always review the data over a sufficiently long period of time to
determine the general min-max range within which the data normally fall. The
main focus of attention should be on events that fall outside the normal range of
data, and in particular, those events that do so in a repetitive manner. If the run chart
contains a large number of data points and at least eight consecutive events appear
on one side or the other of the average, then it is likely that a unique underlying
cause has influenced the process.

For example, the invoice creation process typically requires a few hours
from the point of service or product delivery, but there are valid reasons for
occasional delays in this process, such as a salesperson needing to create a cover
letter to accompany an invoice, or (at the other extreme) an automatic invoice
delivery using electronic data interchange. But what if the creation process is
delayed by the hiring of a new warehouse manager who is not fully conversant
with the process of sending shipment information to the billing staff for
conversion into an invoice? If so, the run chart in Exhibit 14.3 reveals that
the delay in invoice creation suddenly jumps from an average of 3 business hours
to 13 business hours (with an attendant delay of cash flow, which highlights the
importance of this issue). The run chart makes a clear visual case for further
investigation into the invoicing delay, which should ultimately result in the rapid
reeducation of the new warehouse manager.

Where else can the run chart be used in the accounting process? It works best
for the analysis of high-volume transactions, so consider using it for process
analysis in the billing, collections, inventory, payables, and payroll areas.

14-2 Apply Check Sheets to Accounting Processes

The check sheet is a structured form used for the collection and analysis of data. Its
most common application is for the collection of data about the frequency or
patterns of events. Data entry on the form is designed to be as simple as possible,
with check marks or similar symbols. The check sheet is most frequently used in a
production setting, but can be easily applied to the accounting function.

For example, what if the accounting manager is trying to increase the
efficiency of the cash application process? The first step is to determine the
frequency of various issues impacting the process so that the accounting manager
can focus her efforts on efficiency improvement. She discusses the project with the
cash application staff and uses the staff’s input to construct the check sheet shown
in Exhibit 14.4. The cash application staff fills it in during a one-week period,
resulting in the determination that unauthorized payment deductions are the most

14-3 Apply Value Stream Mapping to Accounting Processes

Value stream mapping (VSM) focuses on the identification of waste across an
entire process. Once waste has been identified with this tool, you can focus on the
elimination of the waste. A VSM chart identifies all of the actions required to
complete a process, while also identifying key information about each action item.
Key information will vary by the process under review, but can include total hours
worked, overtime hours, cycle time to complete a transaction, error rates, and
absenteeism.

The value stream chart shown in Exhibit 14.5 addresses the entire procure-
ment cycle, from the initial placement of a requisition through processing of the
resulting supplier invoice. Under each processing step, the VSM chart itemizes the
amount of overtime, staffing, work shifts, process uptime, and transaction error
rate. The chart then shows the total time required for each processing step, as well
as the time required between steps, and also identifies the types of time spent
between steps (e.g., outbound batching, transit time, and inbound queue time).

Exhibit 14.5 Procurement Value Stream Chart


14-4 Apply the Production Cell Layout to Accounting 305

The chart reveals that most of the procurement cycle time is used between
processing steps, especially in the transit time of orders from suppliers to the
company. If total cycle time is an issue, then a reasonable conclusion would be to
either source locally or expend more for faster delivery services. However, if the
emphasis is on speedier in-house processing, then the chart shows that the
purchase-order processing stage is the most time consuming; it is also probably
a bottleneck operation, given the amount of overtime incurred. Likely conclusions
would be to reduce the error rate in the purchasing area by working on a reduction
of errors in the upstream requisitioning area (note how the two error rates are
identical, since the purchasing staff is likely copying errors from requisitions
directly onto the purchase orders), offloading purchasing work with procurement
cards, or bolstering capacity by adding purchasing staff.

Another option for shrinking the total cycle time is to have the receiving staff
send receiving documents to the payables department more frequently than once
every four hours. Cutting the outbound batch time in half would eliminate two
hours from the total cycle time, though this would require two more trips to the
payables department per day by the receiving staff.

Value stream mapping works best in highly focused, high-volume processes
where it makes sense to spend time wringing a few seconds out of repetitive
processes. Conversely, the analysis effort would be wasted in low-volume areas
where the staff constantly switches between multiple tasks.

14-4 Apply the Production Cell Layout to Accounting

One of the reasons that a smaller accounting department tends to be so heavily
cluttered with paperwork is that employees are called on to handle a multitude of
tasks throughout the day—and be prepared to handle each one totally within the
confines of their offices. This means that a single individual may need a multitude
of computers, printers, filing cabinets, and/or binders for multiple activities—such
as cash receipts processing, inventory valuation, and billing—all in one office.
Switching between tasks throughout the day calls for putting away some docu-
ments, accessing others, changing accounting software modules, stocking printers
with different types of forms or check stock, and other activities that increase the
time needed to complete transactions. In addition, if management decides to
centralize files in order to remove the clutter from each person’s office, then
employees now have to walk further in order to access information for their various
tasks. So, it appears that we must either tolerate cluttered offices or more employee
move time—both of which increase the level of transaction processing
inefficiency. Is there a better way?

We can look to the production floor for a solution. Manufacturing operations
have used production cells for years in order to completely process either entire


306 General Best Practices

products or major subassemblies—and all with a relatively small number of
people, sometimes as few as one person. A production cell includes a set
of carefully positioned workstations that allow for easy sequential completion
of every task needed to create a product. If we apply this approach to the
accounting area, the work layout will look substantially different. For example,
one office can be set up to process nothing but invoices, with the necessary filing
cabinets located within that office, a computer terminal always open to the billing
software module, and invoice forms always loaded into the locally positioned
printer. The same approach works for payroll, cash receipts processing, financial
statement preparation, and so on.

There are some downsides to the use of production cells in accounting. For
example, the smaller accounting departments to which this concept primarily
applies may have as few as one employee who operates out of a single office. If so,
setting up several production cells might require several offices. A possible
solution is to reconfigure the work space of a single office so that different
quadrants of the office are permanently configured to handle a single accounting
transaction. There may also be control problems, such as permanently leaving
check stock in a printer. In this case, the solution will be a trade-off between
controls (removing check stock from locked storage) and convenience (taking the
chance that someone will access the check stock).

14-5 Create a Best Practices Support Center

In a larger company having multiple accounting locations, a best practice may be
installed with ease in one location and stall badly in another. This problem can be
due to a variety of environmental factors, differences in the comparative levels of
expertise, implementation errors, or simply different levels of management
support.

These issues can be mitigated by creating a best practices support center. The
support center’s staff can provide services to the rest of the organization at the
strategic or tactical level. For example, it can review an accounting center’s
operations and provide a complete set of best practices recommendations with an
implementation plan, or just help to change management aspects of a specific best
practice. It can also prepackage best practices with supporting policies, procedures,
controls, checklists, and training materials, which makes them much easier to
install.

The support center can also engage in fine-tuning of existing best practices,
going back to prior implementations to see what worked and what did not. It can
work on entirely new best practices by prototyping them in a controlled environ-
ment or working on them with suppliers, and then rolling them out at test locations.
If company managers want to use exactly the same best practices throughout the


14-6 Consolidate All Accounting Functions 307

company (which makes them easier to implement and manage), then the support
center’s staff can derive the most optimized version of a best practice, put its “seal
of approval” on it, and then manage the rollout of that specific version of the best
practice.

If the support center is also assigned to conduct postimplementation reviews,
then it can engage in audits that not only evaluate the success of a best practice but
also measure it across multiple locations. This can lead to further evaluations to
determine why a best practice works better in one location than another.

Essentially, the support center becomes a central repository of knowledge
about best practices and how they can best be implemented but can be expanded
into a consulting and internal auditing practice.

14-6 Consolidate All Accounting Functions

Accompany with many locations will frequently have a separate accounting staff in
each location. By doing so, the overall cost of accounting tends to be much higher
than the industry average because there is a great deal of staff duplication. For
example, each location requires its own controller, assistant controller, and
accounting manager. Also, transaction volumes may not be great enough to fill
the time of the accounting staff in each location, leading to underutilized personnel.
Also, the quality of management may vary significantly between locations,
resulting in differences in the level of efficiency, with locations experiencing
the same transaction volume requiring significantly different volumes in the
number of required accounting staff. Further, with accounting conducted in
many locations, a well-run company must schedule a large number of internal
audits in all of those locations to ensure that procedures are completed in
accordance with corporate standards. Finally, extra labor is needed at corporate
headquarters to consolidate all of the accounting records for financial reporting
purposes. This formidable array of inefficiencies results in a significant increase in
accounting expenses.

The solution to this tangled web of accounting problems is to consolidate all or
most of the functions into the smallest possible number of locations. By doing so,
fewer accounting managers are needed, while procedures can be standardized and
enforced much more easily. Also, given the smaller number of locations, the work
of consolidating financial results is simplified. The only case in which this solution
does not work well is if a company has an extremely diversified set of subsidiaries.
For example, the accounting operations of a railroad, an oil refinery, and a cement
plant are so different that consolidating these functions would be extremely
difficult. Conversely, the consolidation task becomes much easier for those
companies doing business in a single industry and that have many locations
that conduct the same kind of business using approximately the same procedures.


308 General Best Practices

Here are the most common areas in which companies have had success in
centralizing into shared services centers:

¢ Accounts receivable collections

* Cash application

© Cost accounting

¢ Employee expense report processing

¢ Intercompany accounts payable and receivable processing
¢ Inventory accounting

© Invoice processing

¢ Payroll processing

The level of centralization that can be achieved with shared services centers
depends on the nature of the function being centralized. For example, a separate
collections center may be required for each country, since this calls for considera-
ble customer contact in the local language, as well as knowledge of the local laws
regarding collections. Service centers can be more global if they involve services
that are highly standardized and transactional in nature and that require minimal
expertise.

However, this best practice requires a great deal of management skill and
money. For example, combining the accounts payable functions of many locations
requires the construction of a central processing facility, along with the transfer of
staff to that location, retraining, the design of new systems, new audit procedures,
and the orderly transfer of supplier invoices from many locations to a single one—
and in the midst of this massive change, suppliers must still be paid on time so there
is no disruption of deliveries to the company from suppliers. Given the size of this
task, the major factors needed to ensure success are the appointment of an excellent
manager to the consolidation process, the complete support of this project by top
management, and sufficient funding to see it through to completion. In addition,
given the amount of disruption involved, it would be wise to consolidate only one
function at a time so that most activities are not interrupted at the same time. By
taking these steps, the odds of successfully finishing a consolidation project are
greatly enhanced.

14-7 Continually Review Key Process Cycles

As a general rule, any system will begin to degrade as soon as it is created. For
example, a new purchasing process cycle will begin almost immediately to
encounter exceptions to the rules, as well as special situations that spawn a subset


14-7 Continually Review Key Process Cycles 309

of extra procedures that do not appear anywhere in the procedures manual. Further,
the process will not be maintained very well, resulting in lots of excess data in the
system, such as the records of suppliers that have not been used in years,
perpetually open purchase orders, even though the orders were filled long ago,
and supplier invoices that have a permanent “hold” slapped on them so that they
cannot be paid. The example is only for accounts payable, but the same problem
applies to all processes. Thus, over time, all of an accounting department’s
processes will be in desperate need of a tune-up.

That tune-up is provided by a rarely used best practice in which a designated
employee is in charge of constantly reviewing process cycles. In some companies,
this person is called the “process owner,” with responsibility for the flow of
information through a specific process and for any changes to it. When someone is
assigned to review process cycles, there should be a very detailed set of tasks to be
reviewed. To use the previous example, the process owner should review the list of
suppliers in the computer to see which can be deleted, check on open purchase
orders to see what can be closed, review the list of suppliers with early payment
discounts to verify that discounts are taken, check with the receiving staff to ensure
that they receive only goods labeled with valid purchase order numbers, and
review payment packets to verify that all payments were only for items authorized
by the purchasing department. If the process is complex enough, one or more
people may be assigned to it—otherwise, one person may be assigned multiple
cycles and rotate through a review of them all so all primary cycles receive a tune-up
several times a year.

One advantage of constantly reviewing process cycles is that few exception
transactions will occur, resulting in far less research work to correct problems.
Another factor is that employees involved in creating transactions will receive
constant advice from the process owner regarding how they are supposed to be
conducting their work, resulting in much better standardization of output. Further,
the process owner constantly reviews why old transactions have not yet been
completed, tracks down the reasons for the problems, and corrects them at the
source. None of these changes are major, but when taken as a whole, they represent
a considerable improvement in the way a company’s key processes operate. This
work is well worth the effort.

The main problem is that the process owner is a new position and adds to
overhead. However, the number of mistakes this person finds and corrects will
frequently pay back his or her salary. For example, finding and fixing a hole in the
revenue cycle that lets shipments disappear from the system may keep a company
from missing billings to customers. Similarly, keeping the accounts payable staff
from making unapproved payments to suppliers will also save money. A second
problem is that this position tends to step outside the boundaries of the accounting
department, since the processes being reviewed are impacted by other departments,
such as the shipping and receiving departments and the purchasing department.
Because this may be looked on as interference by the accounting department, a
process owner must be a very tactful person and strongly supported by upper

management. If these issues can be overcome, the process owner becomes a major
contributor to the smooth functioning of any company.

14-8 Create a Policies and Procedures Manual

As is noted several times in this chapter, an unorganized accounting department is
inefficient, suffers from a high transaction error rate, and does not complete its
work products on time. While other best practices noted in this chapter, such as
general training, cross-training, and calendars of events, will contribute to a more
structured environment, one of the very best ways to create a disciplined
accounting group is to create and maintain a policies and procedures manual.
This manual should list the main policies under which the accounting
department operates, such as those listed in Exhibit 14.6. These are the key issues
that confront each functional area and are usually limited to just a few pages.

expenditures not already listed in the annual budget, regardless of the amount.

¢ Every molding machine shall be assigned a salvage value of 25 percent of the purchase price.
Logistics:

¢ Any items arriving at the receiving dock without a purchase order number will be rejected.
Travel and Entertainment:

¢ All reimbursements require a receipt.

¢ Employees must show all receipts for travel advances within one week of travel, or the
advance will be considered a salary advance.

* Only coach fares will be reimbursed.
¢ There is no movie reimbursement.
¢ There is no reimbursement for commuting miles.

¢ There is no reimbursement for lunch mileage.

 

Anything longer probably indicates an excessive degree of control or some
confusion in the difference between a policy and a procedure.

A good example of a policy is one that sets a boundary for an activity. The first
policy noted in Exhibit 14.6 states that an accounts payable clerk is allowed to
process any supplier invoice within 5 percent of the amount listed on the original
purchase order. By doing so, this policy clearly defines what the clerk is allowed to
do. A procedure, by contrast, defines the precise activities that take place within
the boundaries the policies create. An example ofa procedure is shown in Exhibit 14.7,
where there is a definitive listing of the exact steps one must follow in order to create
and issue the annual budget. A procedure is usually sufficient to use as a guideline foran
employee who needs to understand how a process works. When combined with a

Exhibit 14.7 Sample Procedure Page

Procedure: Update the annual budget

Responsibility: Controller

Steps:
1.

Expense update. As of mid-November, issue each department a listing of its
expenses, annualized based on actual expenses through October of the current
year. The listing should include the personnel in each department and their current
pay levels. Request a return date of 10 days in the future for this information, which
should include estimated changes in expenses.

. Revenue update. As of mid-November, issue the sales manager a listing of revenue

by month by business unit, through October of the current year. Request a return
date of 10 days in the future for this information, which should include estimated
changes in revenues.

. Capital expenditure update. As of mid-November, issue a form to all department

heads, requesting information about the cost and timing of capital expenditures for
the upcoming year. Request a return date of 10 days in the future for this information.

. Automation update. As of mid-November, issue a form to the engineering manager,

requesting estimates of the timing and size of reductions in headcount in the
upcoming year due to automation efforts. Request a return date of 10 days in the
future for this information. Be sure to compare scheduled headcount reductions to
the timing of capital expenditures, since they should track closely.

. Update the budget model. This task should be completed by the end of November,

and includes the following steps:

1. Update the numbers already listed in the budget with information received from the
various managers. This may involve changing “hard-coded” dollar amounts or
changing flex budget percentages. Be sure to keep a checklist of who has returned
information so you can follow up with those personnel who have not returned it.

2. Update the “Prior Year” cells on the left side of the budget model with estimated year-
end balances (primarily for the balance sheet).

3. Update the “Last Year” cells on the right side of the budget model, using annualized
figures.

4. Verify that the indirect overhead allocation percentages shown on the budgeted
factory overhead page are still accurate.

5. Verify that the Federal Insurance Contributors Act (FICA), State Unemployment
Tax (SUTA), Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA), medical, and workers’ compen-
sation amounts listed at the top of the staffing budget page are still accurate.

6. Add job titles and pay levels to the staffing page as needed, along with new average
pay rates based on projected pay levels made by department managers.

7. Runa depreciation report for the upcoming year, add the expected depreciation for
new capital expenditures, and add this amount to the budget.

8. Revise the loan detail budget based on projected borrowings through the end of the
year. Be sure to list only loan balance reductions based on principal pay-downs, not
interest payments.


14-8 Create a Policies and Procedures Manual 313

Exhibit 14.7 (Continued)

6. Review the budget. Print out the budget and circle any budgeted expenses or revenues
that are significantly different from the annualized amounts for the current year (do this
by comparing the last two columns on each page). Go over the questionable items with
the managers who are responsible for them.

7. Revise the budget. Revise the budget, print it again, and review it with the president.
Incorporate any additional changes.

8. Issue the budget. Bind the budget and issue it to the management team.

9. Update accounting database. Enter budgetnumbers into the accounting software for the
upcoming year. All tasks should be completed by mid-December.

 

proper level of training, the policies and procedures manual is an effective way
not only to increase control over the accounting department but also to enhance

its

efficiency.
Though there are few excuses for not having such a manual, there are some

pitfalls to consider when constructing it, as well as for maintaining and enforcing it.
They are as follows:

Not enough detail. A procedure that does not cover activity steps in a
sufficient degree of detail is not of much use to someone who is using it for the
first time; it is important to list specific forms used, computer screens accessed,
and fields on those screens in which information is entered, as well as the other
positions that either supply information for the procedure or to which it sends
information. It may also be helpful to include a flowchart, which is more
understandable than text for some people.

Not reinforced. A procedures manual does not do much good if it is
immediately parked on a remote shelf in the accounting department. Instead,
it should be made an integral part of all training programs and included in
periodic discussions regarding the updating and improvement of key processes.
Only through constant attention will the manual be used to the fullest extent.

Not updated. Even the best manual will become obsolete over time, as
changing circumstances alter procedures to the point where the manual no
longer describes conditions as they currently exist. When this happens, no one
bothers to use the manual. Accordingly, it is necessary to update the manual
whenever changes are made to the underlying systems.

Too many procedures. A common problem is that the manual is never released
because the controller is determined to include a procedure for every conceiv-
able activity the accounting department will ever encounter. However, the main
principle to follow is that the manual must be issued soon, so it is better to issue it
quickly with procedures that cover the bulk of accounting activities and address
the remaining procedures at a later date. This approach gets the key information
to those employees who need it the most, and does so very quickly.


314 General Best Practices

The single most important factor in the success of a policies and procedures
manual is an active accounting manager. This person must reinforce the use of the
manual with the staff so it is not simply ignored as a onetime report gathering dust
on a shelf. Only through continual attention by the entire staff will it become the
foundation of how all key accounting processes are completed.

14-9 Eliminate All Transaction Backlogs

Accounting departments get in trouble when they develop a permanent backlog of
standard accounting transactions, usually in the areas of cash receipts processing,
billings, and payables. When a backlog arises, the focus of the department shifts to
the servicing of this backlog, to the exclusion of all other value-added activities,
such as improving processes or providing better customer service. Also, backlogs
tend to create piles of paperwork in which other documents can be lost, resulting in
extra search time to locate needed materials.

A crucial best practice is to eliminate these backlogs, usually by allocating
extra staff time to them. Once the piles are eliminated, the controller can focus on
increased levels of training and process improvement in order to reduce the number
of people required to keep the backlog from reoccurring. If a company has a highly
variable amount of transaction volume, some backlog may reappear in periods of
high activity, though this can be avoided through the careful use of the preplanned
hiring of part-time workers to assist the regular staff. There is also likely to be some
buildup in the backlog on a temporary basis at the end of each month and especially
at the end of the fiscal year, as closing activities take priority. However, these
are temporary issues whose impact on the backlog can be eliminated within a
few days.

14-10 Implement Process-Centering

A major problem at many companies is the inordinate amount of time it takes to
complete a process. For example, insurance companies are famous for spending
many weeks to review an insurance claim and issue a payment check, when the
total amount of work required is under an hour. The long time period from the
beginning to the end of the process is usually due to the number of transfers
between employees. For example, the insurance branch office may forward a claim
to an insurance adjuster, who passes it along to a manager if the amount exceeds a
set level, or who hands it off to another person who checks to see if the claim might
be fraudulent or if the claimant has an unusually long history of claims, then moves


14-11 Remove Clutter from the Accounting Workspace 315

the paperwork to another person who issues checks, and then returns the entire
packet to the insurance branch office. Insurance is just an example—upon further
investigation, it is common to find that all companies invest a shocking amount of
time in moving paperwork among a multitude of employees. A related problem is
that transactions can be lost when they are moved between employees. Further, it is
difficult to pin blame on anyone when a transaction is improperly completed
because there are so many people involved in the process. Thus, spreading work
among too many people opens a virtual Pandora’s box of troubles.

The solution is called process centering. Its underlying principle is to cluster as
many work tasks for a single process as possible with a single person. By doing so,
there are fewer transfers of documentation, which reduces the amount of time lost
during these movements, while at the same time eliminating the risk that paperwork
will be lost. Further, employees have much more complete and fulfilling jobs since
they see a much larger part of the process and have a better feeling for how the entire
process works. And best of all for a company, the time needed to complete
transactions drops drastically, sometimes to less than 10 percent of the amount
previously needed.

The main problem with process centering is employee resistance. This is a
reengineering best practice, which means that the old process is ripped up and
replaced with an entirely new workflow, which makes many employees nervous
about their jobs, or if they will even have a job when the changes are complete.
Accordingly, they usually are not pleased with the prospect of a new system
and resist vigorously, or at least are not of any assistance. Only excellent communi-
cations and a strong commitment by top management to completing the project will
make this best practice operational, given the likely level of resistance to it.

14-11 Remove Clutter from the Accounting Workspace

There can be a considerable amount of physical movement within the accounting
department, to the point where employees are spending a significant proportion of
their time walking, rather than working. It is possible to reduce the amount of
inefficient workflow within the department by reducing clutter and adjusting the
layout of the accounting workspace. Use the following steps to complete this
reconfiguration:

1. Remove from the department anything that gets in the way, such as excess
chairs, desks, and filing cabinets, as well as unused computers, printers, and so
forth. Once these items are gone, create a layout chart of the entire department.
On the chart, note all furniture, office, and cubicles, and then add the flow of
travel that employees take over the course of the day. The travel flow will
probably indicate a considerable amount of unnecessary travel.


316 General Best Practices

2. Acquire a number of smaller printers and copiers and distribute them
throughout the department, so there is no need to travel to a central printing
or copying facility. Also create a departmental mail drop, and have someone
collect it once at the end of the day and mail all dropped items.

3. Move filing cabinets closest to those who use them, or distribute wheeled
carts that can be used to easily transport batches of files.

4. Replace cubicles with desks, which are easier to reconfigure. Then create
small work groups by assembling clusters of desks for those people who
need to work together. At a minimum, eliminate cubicles with high walls,
since they interfere with communications.

5. For each employee, completely clean out their work areas and only put back
those items that are really needed. Return all other items to the supply closet.
Where possible, even remove the doors from cabinets and remove drawers.
By doing so, it is more difficult for employees to hoard low-usage materials.
The result should be an extremely efficient work surface that only includes
those items that employees actually need.

In short, there are a number of steps you can take to improve the underlying
efficiency level of the accounting workspace. The core improvement concepts are
to remove work impediments and cluster together those people who need to
interact with each other.

14-12 Issue Activity Calendars to All Accounting Positions

The bane of any accounting department is disorganization. This department, above
all others, is responsible for consistently completing the same tasks, day after day
and year after year, with a great deal of reliability. If the employees cannot organize
themselves properly so key tasks are completed on time, the entire function can fall
into disarray, resulting in payments and billings not being completed on time. Also,
financial statements, the most subject to delays if there is disorganization, will be
released much later than expected, possibly containing a large number of errors.
Clearly, some instrument of organization must be found.

An excellent tool for straightening out the timing of accounting work is the
calendar. You can create a calendar on the computer, either with a scheduling
software package or an electronic spreadsheet, and load it with all of the tasks to be
completed each day. An example of such a calendar is shown in Exhibit 14.8.
Though some employees are naturally well organized and will already have it in
place, many others will be in desperate need of this simple organizational tool. The
best way to distribute these calendar schedules is to keep the schedules for all
employees in a single location, update them at the end of each month, and have a

14-13 Switch to Online Reporting

In organizations that occupy a large geographical area, the accounting staff faces
the chore of somehow sending financial and operational reporting information to
many locations. This can mean a mass mailing once a month, or perhaps more
frequently if daily or weekly reports are required. If there is some urgency to this

 


318 General Best Practices

information, overnight express mail delivery may be necessary, which is quite
expensive, especially when used many times a year for many locations. Faxing this
information is frequently not an allowable option, for the information being
transmitted may be so sensitive that there is too great a risk that the wrong person
will retrieve the information from the fax machine. Thus, sending paper reports
throughout a company, and especially a large one, is a major hassle.

An effective means for eliminating the problems with paper-based reports is to
switch to electronic transmission. By doing so, there is no need to send any paper
documents and there is also no transmission time interval before the information is
available to recipients. The only difficulty is that a few of the more formal documents,
such as audited financial statements, with their accompanying footnotes and graphics,
cannot be sent easily by electronic means, unless they are first scanned into an image
file. However, for the bulk of all reports, this remains an effective approach.

Information can be sent electronically in either a passive or “push” mode. In
the passive mode, the accounting department simply posts the information in a file
and waits for employees to go to the file to scan the data. The push method involves
sending information to employees by e-mail. The push method is generally more
effective, since there is no way for employees to avoid the data, unless they are in
the habit of deleting their e-mail without first reading it.

This approach can be an expensive one with a long implementation interval
but only under certain implementation approaches. It is certainly more expensive if
a special file structure is created to contain the online reports, especially if the data
are to be contained in a data warehouse. Even the less difficult approach of sending
out reports by e-mail requires the previous installation of a companywide email
system, which can be a problem if there are many locations to be linked. However,
the distribution of data is made vastly easier by the presence of the Internet; any
company location can now obtain an email address from a third-party e-mail
provider at minimal cost and receive electronic transmissions through this
electronic mailbox. Another alternative is to spend a moderate amount on a
corporate intranet site, on which financial reports can be posted under an icon.
Though an effective and easy-to-use approach, it does require access to the intranet
from outlying locations. Consequently, there are implementation alternatives for
all possible budgets, starting with distribution by the Internet, progressing through
an intranet site, and ending with a custom-made file structure with comprehensive
user access. The best approach will depend on a company’s budget, existing
systems, and information distribution requirements.

14-14 Track Function Measurements

The role of the accounting department does not just include completing daily transac-
tions and issuing financial statements. In addition, it must issue periodic measurements


14-16 Create a Contract Terms Database 319

to the rest of the company that show the results of key activities. A poorly organized
accounting department may issue this information only grudgingly when senior
management demands it. This approach does not allow the accounting staff to derive
a set of standard procedures for the collection of measurement information, nor does it
build up much goodwill with the management team.

A better approach is to create a standardized set of performance criteria that
the accounting staff will calculate and distribute at set intervals. An example of
such a report is shown in Exhibit 14.9. By using this report, management can spot
operational problems at once and correct them. Also, the controller can play a key
role in determining which measurements are used; this can be a pivotal item in
some situations, for other department managers may not want to have their poor
performance measured and reported. Also, with a standardized set of measure-
ments, the controller can build the measurement task into the accounting depart-
ment’s daily work schedule in a manner that does not interfere with other
operations, while also allowing for the construction of a procedure that standard-
izes the calculation of each measurement (ensuring the consistency of calculations
from period to period). These are all good reasons for implementing a reporting
system for key corporate measurements.

14-15 Discuss Major Accounting Decisions with Auditors

All too often, a company will decide to account for a major transaction in a certain
way, only to find at year-end that its auditors have an entirely different interpreta-
tion of the proper accounting, resulting in a restatement of its expected results. This
problem can arise in any number of complex accounting areas, such as business
combinations, intangible assets, derivatives, and revenue recognition.

The best solution is to contact the auditors whenever such an accounting
decision is being discussed internally to obtain their informal opinion regarding the
proper accounting treatment. A supplemental method is for the controller to write a
memo on current and forthcoming accounting issues at the end of each quarter and
circulate it to the CEO, CFO, audit committee, and the audit partner for their
comments. By using both techniques in combination, the accounting department
keeps all relevant internal users of the financial statements aware of accounting
issues and makes it much less likely that there will be any restatement surprises at
the end of the fiscal year.

14-16 Create a Contract Terms Database 321

missed billings to customers or payments to suppliers. Due to the special nature of
these agreements, which fall outside of the usual accounts payable and receivable
systems, it is easy for them to be forgotten. Examples of these contracts are billings
for the sublease of company equipment, rebates, and maintenance agreements. The
typical result of these problems is either missing revenue, because customers were
not billed, or irate suppliers that were not paid. In the latter case, missing payments
to suppliers may also result in the failure of key services to the company, such as
failed maintenance agreements for key equipment. Thus, a lack of attention to the
terms of a company’s various contractual arrangements can result in lost revenues
or services.

The solution is to create a database of all current contractual agreements, along
with a central file containing copies of all the contracts. An example of a contract
terms database is shown in Exhibit 14.11. This database lists all of the key
information about each contract, including the due date on which billings or
payments are supposed to occur, the termination date of the contract, the frequency
with which activities are required, the amounts involved, and any extra details to
clarify the nature of each transaction—in short, a brief but thorough summarization of
all the activities needed to fulfill the terms of all contracts. In case there are questions
about the terms of each agreement, the accounting department should maintain copies
of all agreements, as well as an extra file containing any agreements that have expired
in the last few years. This arrangement will quickly bring order to the administration
of any contracts that are the responsibility of the accounting department.

The implication thus far has been to create a contract terms database from
scratch. However, it is also possible to purchase a commercial off-the-shelf product
from a number of suppliers. These systems are usually linked to a company’s
enterprise resource planning or customer relationship management software, so
they can access information stored elsewhere in the company. This linkage
requires a custom-built interface. Depending on the amount of contractual
information to be included in the installed system, you can expect the implemen-
tation of such a system to extend from at least two months up to a year. The cost of
these systems begins at about $150,000 for a small installation and can easily reach
several million dollars for a large company, depending on the number of users.
Some special features make this software worth the price, for example, the ability
to pinpoint contract wording that may impact revenue recognition, such as
acceptance clauses and extended payment terms. This is particularly valuable
in avoiding embarrassing adjustments to the level of revenue recognized in order to
be in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and Securities and
Exchange Commission rules.

Another feature is a warning indicator when one customer is being offered a
lower price than other customers, which flags other contractual agreements in
which other customers are guaranteed the lowest price offered. By spotting this
problem in advance, a company can avoid having to rebate payments to other
customers in order to bring the prices they paid down to the price level of the most
recent customer contract.

Most of these software packages also offer a library of standard contract
terms so that a company can extract the boilerplate text it needs to construct
new contracts much more quickly. By doing so, you can also ensure that
the same text is used across all contracts, thereby ensuring a fair degree of
uniformity.

14-17 Install a Knowledge Management System

Too many accounting managers rely solely upon themselves for the generation of
ideas, treating their staffs simply as workers who do what they are told. This
command-level management approach ignores a potentially vast amount of worker
expertise. While the primary cause of this problem is the mind-set of the
accounting manager, there are software systems available that can assist in
collecting ideas from employees.

These systems are called knowledge management systems (KMSs). A KMS is
not a glorified suggestion box (though it does have that function!). In addition to
accepting suggestions, it also focuses contributors onto several key challenges
identified by corporate management, establishes bulletin boards on which related
comments can be posted, and keeps contributors updated with the latest posted
comments. In addition, management can assign suggestions to groups of in-house
experts for evaluation, score their comments, and assign approved suggestions
for implementation. Thus, a KMS covers the entire workflow associated with
employee suggestions, assuring that they are reviewed, approved, and imple-
mented in a timely manner. Such systems are really designed for large organiza-
tions, and are priced accordingly (a mid-five-figure price tag is the minimum
starting point).

14-18 Monitor Fixed Assets with Wireless Sensors

There can be considerable uncertainty about when to replace a fixed asset, which
impacts the capital allocation decision. Wireless sensors can help. These devices
can monitor changes in lighting, position, temperature, humidity, incline, vibra-
tion, and pitch/roll/yaw. When configured as wireless devices that transmit from
difficult-to-reach locations, they are ideal for monitoring the condition of fixed
assets, especially those on the factory floor. A typical setup is for the sensor to
transmit a wireless signal to a local router when it senses a significant change,
which passes the data along to a computer, which, in turn, matches the data against
a predetermined out-of-specification condition. If the reported condition is


324 General Best Practices

considered to be outside the predetermined boundary, then the computer sends a
warning e-mail to the appropriate person.

Although wireless sensors have been available for several years, the key
improvement that allows for their more widespread use is the Zigbee communi-
cation protocol, which is designed for devices with low data transmission rates and
low power consumption. This protocol allows sensors to run for well over a year on
a single battery. Also, a recent estimate of the cost of a Zigbee-configured radio is
just $1.10 (when produced in high volume), though the radio must be coupled with
a sensor device that raises its total price considerably.

The wireless sensor is extremely useful for determining the exact moment
when a fixed asset is failing, since the asset’s temperature or level of vibration may
rise by a measurable amount shortly before it fails. By monitoring these key
indicators, management can determine precisely when asset replacement is
needed, rather than guessing and either replacing it much too soon or waiting
until it fails, precipitating a replacement crisis.

14-19 Create an Online Tax Policy Listing

The accounting staff does not always have a clear grasp of the tax implications of
various accounting transactions. Examples of these problem areas are transfer
pricing, capital movements, and employee contracts and benefits. When a question
arises in regard to such a problem, either it is put on hold while a question is run
past the legal or tax staffs or else it is processed in ignorance of the answer—which
frequently leads to a lack of consistency in the handling of transactions, and a large
headache for the tax staff. These problems can be avoided by installing a clear set
of tax policies online.

By itemizing the most current tax policies online, anyone in the accounting
department can readily research problems and expect to find answers within a
few minutes of a tax-related question being posed. If the answer is not there, then
the site can also include an e-mail linkage to the tax or legal department so that
the problem can then be properly researched and posted online for the next
person who has the same problem. Also, because the posting is online, there is
no need to issue a cumbersome mailing to a list of approved recipients every time
a change is made to the policies; instead, the change can be readily made to the
online posting, which makes it available to anyone at once. Certainly, there will
be complex transactional situations that are so unique that only the advice of a
trained tax person will yield the correct answer to a query. Nonetheless,
the majority of tax problems can be resolved for the accounting staff by this
simple means.

14-21 Assign Tax Staff to Business Units 325

14-20 Designate a Tax Liaison for Each Government Jurisdiction

A company with multiple locations will undoubtedly have taxation issues with a
variety of government entities, each of which collects taxes under a separate set of
tules, forms, and timetables. The usual approach to dealing with these jurisdictions
is to research problems only when contacted by one of them. This results in a crisis
level of review work at the last minute, which can result in incorrect decisions
regarding how to address each tax issue.

A better approach is to assign tax liaison responsibility to several members of
the accounting staff (or tax staff, if this is a separate group). Each person is
responsible for obtaining contact information for his or her counterpart within the
assigned government. This can include establishing contact and building relations,
but only if the amount of ongoing contact over tax issues warrants the level of work
involved. Each liaison should know what problems the company has had in the
past with the assigned jurisdiction, and be aware of any current issues over which
the jurisdiction has recently contacted the company. The liaison should become the
lead person for all contacts, as well as for making recommendations to manage-
ment for how to deal with current tax issues (as supported by knowledgeable legal
counsel, of course).

By using tax liaisons, a company can deal with tax problems in a proactive
manner, and be considered a good tax “citizen” by the various government
jurisdictions with which it deals on a regular basis. However, this approach is
cost effective only if there is a sufficient level of ongoing taxation issues to warrant
the time commitment involved.

Cost: SF Installation time: §3 €3

14-21 Assign Tax Staff to Business Units

The tax staff tends to work in a reactive mode, whereby it passes judgment on
operational decisions after they have occurred. By doing so, some operational
activities must be altered after they have been initiated, due to unfavorable tax results,
while in other cases the tax staff must scramble to mitigate unfavorable tax situations.

These concerns can be eliminated by assigning senior members of the tax staff
to the various business units as tax advisers. This is by no means full-time work; it
is intended only to give each business unit manager an assigned tax contact who is
available to answer taxation-related questions, as well as to review business plans
for activities that may have a tax impact. This is likely to result in monthly
meetings between the two parties. This approach is also a good way to develop
close links between the tax department and other areas of the company so that tax
staff are considered to be helpful resources.

14-22 Outsource Tax Form Preparation

For smaller firms, the accurate and timely preparation of tax forms is a monumental
pain that frequently results in missed filing dates, incorrect payments, and
penalties. The reason is that a smaller organization cannot afford the services
of a full-time tax accountant, which means that incoming tax forms are routed to
whomever has time to complete them. No one likes to do tax forms and so they end
up at the bottom of someone’s work pile, resulting in a last-minute rush to complete
them, without much regard to accuracy or filing dates. Larger organizations do not
have this problem, since they have specialists on staff who can organize a steady
stream of tax work, resulting in accurate tax filings mailed out precisely on time
and that are supported by fully documented work papers. Thus, the controller of a
small company needs to find a better way to prepare tax forms.

The solution is to outsource the bulk of the tax filings to one or more suppliers,
usually with a few tax returns remaining in-house. A common situation is for a
company’s audit firm to take over all federal and state income tax returns. These are
among the most complex returns to file, and these are precisely the forms that most
audit firms specialize in filing. In addition, many companies outsource their payroll,
so the payroll-processing suppliers will handle all of the tax return information
related to payroll. This leaves local returns, which are best kept in-house—these
documents are usually so specialized that suppliers do not have any experience in
filing them and so are no more efficient (and much more expensive) than the
accounting employees who can do the same work. Thus, there are opportunities to
divest an accounting department of the majority of its tax form preparation work.

There are two factors to consider when outsourcing tax work. First, some
suppliers will charge an inordinate amount to prepare a tax return. To avoid this
problem, it is wise to first inquire about the hourly rates of the supplier’s staff who
are most likely to prepare taxes and the likely time required to complete each
return. If the expected amount is too high, it may be useful to comparison-shop
against the rates of other tax preparation firms. It may also be possible to institute a
fixed fee for each tax return, thereby capping the expense. Second, there is some
inefficiency in separating the tax filing work from the outside auditors a company
already uses. The reason is that the auditor must copy the work papers and send
them to the tax supplier, which is not only an extra expense but also slower than
leaving all of the work with the auditor. Despite these problems, it is a very good
idea for a smaller firm to outsource the preparation of its tax returns.

14-23 Submit Electronic Tax Returns to the IRS

The standard procedure for a smaller company is to have a local tax professional
prepare its tax returns, after which the company controller reviews the return,


14-24 Pay Federal Taxes Online 327

verifies that all pages have been attached, and mails it to the IRS. During this
process, there is a risk that some attachments will be lost or misplaced, or that the
entire return will be lost, either by the mailroom, the Postal Service, or the IRS.

It is possible to avoid these risks with the IRS’s e-filing service that allows for
the electronic submission of essentially all corporate tax forms and related
attachments. It also results in fast acknowledgment by the IRS of receipt. In
addition, the IRS automatically checks the returns for errors and missing infor-
mation, so fixes can be made immediately.

The e-filing program is mandatory for companies having assets greater than
$10 million and that file more than 250 returns per year, but smaller firms can
certainly file by this means as well.

A company must submit Form 8633 to apply for admission into the e-filing
program, or can have an IRS-authorized e-file provider handle the submission. A
number of tax-software providers have linked their systems to the IRS system, so
there are multiple ways to submit tax returns.

Cost: SF Installation time: §3
14-24 Pay Federal Taxes Online

There are a number of taxes that a company must pay to the federal government,
such as unemployment insurance, Medicare, Social Security, withheld income
taxes, and corporate income taxes. Since this can involve a substantial amount of
money, companies tend to wait until the last minute to deposit them, usually
through the local bank. If there is no one available to go to the bank to transfer the
funds to the government, or if the bank is closed for any reason, then the company
will be penalized for late payments. This is a particular problem when only a few
people know how to make the deposits and they are unavailable for any reason on
the day when a payment is required.

These problems can be resolved by making online payments to the federal
government through its free www.eftps.gov site. This involves creating an account
with the government online through its “New Taxpayer Enrollment Form” and then
waiting up to 15 days for the IRS to mail a personal identification number, also
known as a PIN to you. Once received, a company can then request an Internet
password and submit tax payments at any time of the day or night, seven days a week.
The government then transfers the designated funds out of the company bank
account. A printable confirmation is made available, which a company can retain as
proof of payment to the government. A transaction history is also available online for
all payments made within the last 120 days. It is even possible to schedule payments
up to 120 days prior to a tax payment due date, so the government can automatically
withdraw the required funds on a targeted date without anyone from the company
having to be present. Though the implication here is that payments are only
authorized through an Internet site, a company can also do this over the phone
or with downloaded PC-based software that uses a dial-up modem.


328 General Best Practices

Once a company’s total tax remittances to the federal government exceed
$200,000 per year, it must use this system. If a company that is required to use
the system then chooses to make a manual payment with a tax coupon, it will be
subject to a 10 percent penalty (though this does not apply to voluntary
participants that fall below the $200,000 threshold). Also, if a company pays
taxes from a variety of bank accounts, it must set up different accounts with the
government for each bank account, since there is currently no way for
the government to remove funds from multiple accounts through the electronic
funds payment transfer system. Finally, the system cannot be used to make
last-minute payments; instead, transfers must be initiated no later than the
day before a tax payment is due, in order to ensure that the IRS receives it
in time.

14-25 Create Accounting Training Teams

A key problem for accounting managers is how to determine the correct amount
and type of training to require of their employees. Sending them to degree
programs is too expensive and only provides relevant training for a small
proportion of the time spent being trained. Shorter programs are more targeted
but are still expensive and may not directly relate to work requirements. For these
reasons, many accounting managers do not allow any training, or only under very
restricted circumstances. By doing so, they are limiting the skill sets of their
employees and not allowing them to fulfill personal career advancement goals,
which may result in increased employee turnover.

A solution is the use of internal accounting training teams. The basic process is
to conduct a periodic survey of employees and job functions to determine what types
of training programs are needed. A consultant or manager-level employee then creates
the general course syllabus for each training program (consultants can be useful here,
since managers may not have sufficient available time to work on syllabi). Each
syllabus is then handed over to a group of in-house accounting staff, who become
responsible for creating the details of each course, and teaching it. A manager is
typically assigned to each course to oversee its development and act as a mentor.

The primary advantage of this approach is that training can be precisely
tailored to a company’s exact needs, throwing out all irrelevant topics that might
otherwise be taught during a university-sponsored class. Because of their extreme
specificity, these classes are also usually quite short, allowing employees to either
fit them into daytime schedules or into abbreviated evening training sessions.
Examples of training topics under this approach could be process-centering
techniques, methodologies for finding cost-cutting approaches within specific
transactions, and training on specific functions within the company’s accounting
software. Also, by bringing together trainers from all parts of the accounting
organization, from administrative assistants to the CFO, the level of

communication will likely improve. Finally, because all training classes are
created and taught in-house, the incremental cost of classes is reduced.

14-26 Create an Ongoing Training Program for All Accounting
Personnel

The efficiency and effectiveness of an accounting department are based on many
factors, but a crucial one all too many controllers ignore is training. Many
accounting managers simply assume that their staffs have acquired all the
knowledge they need in college and in subsequent work experience and need
no further training of any kind. This belief is based on the erroneous assumption
that all accounting practices are the same, no matter where accountants work, and
that employees can be neatly swapped between jobs and companies with no
additional training of any kind. Over the long term, this can have a major impact on
the accounting staff, for the following reasons:

¢ Accounting rule changes. The accounting profession is constantly reviewing
changes in how accounting transactions are completed and reported, resulting
in a multitude of rule changes, especially in the area of financial reporting.
Anyone who has not received formal training in these changes within the past
few years must receive training in all rules updates, while those not having
been trained in a decade or more will require comprehensive retraining.

¢ Computer-specific knowledge. There are many accounting software pack-
ages in use, all with their own quirks and foibles. Each of these packages
requires special training before employees will fully comprehend how to use
them most effectively, as well as (perhaps more importantly) what not to do,
since some systems require expert usage to run properly.

¢ Lack of management training. Accounting is not just clerical—it requires an
excellent knowledge of how to manage processes in a multitude of functional
areas, frequently including employees in outlying locations. Without proper
management training, there will almost certainly be gross inefficiencies and
errors in the department.

¢ Lack of process training. The accounting function, above all others, deals
with processes, such as the revenue cycle or the purchasing cycle. Allemployees
in this department must have a clear knowledge of exactly how these processes
work so they can process information through them most efficiently, as well as
make modifications that will further increase the level of efficiency. Though
some of this knowledge can be gleaned through many years of experience, it is
best to cut short this interval through a training program that imparts both the
fundamentals and the detailed steps involved in all key company processes.


330 General Best Practices

¢ Lack of training for advanced positions. Though employees may be
adequately trained in their existing jobs, this does not mean that they are
in any way prepared to take over positions higher in the accounting hierarchy.
Without the necessary training to prepare them for these positions, employees
may become frustrated and leave for other companies willing to provide the
training for more advanced and higher-paying jobs.

¢ Practices that are industry specific. Many industries have accounting
practices that are completely unique. An example of this is the gambling
industry, which has an extreme orientation toward the collection, handling,
and recording of cash coming from the gambling floor. In these industries, it is
dangerous to bring in people from other industries without first giving them a
sufficient degree of training in industry-specific accounting practices.

The types of training classes administered may vary considerably from the
rote accounting topics that are covered in a traditional business college. For
example, Allied-Signal includes the following topics in its accounting and finance
curriculum:

¢ Accounting for business combinations
¢ Activity-based management

¢ Business controls

* Cash-flow management

* Coaching and career management
* Controllership

© Diversity

¢ E-commerce

¢ Financial planning and analysis

¢ Global finance

¢ Management accounting

¢ Mergers and acquisitions

¢ Six sigma

¢ Supply-chain management

¢ Taxation

¢ Revenue-chain management

All of these reasons sum up strongly in favor of a detailed and prolonged
training program for the entire accounting department covering such areas as
software, processes, new pronouncements by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board, industry-specific issues, and general management training.

The best way to set up a training program is to make a list of all positions in
the accounting department and determine the training strengths and weaknesses

package. It is also useful to maintain a list of credit hours for continuing
professional education, in case employees want to pursue or maintain profes-
sional accreditation.

The main problem with training programs is that employees usually must be
forced to complete their scheduled training, since they find that there is not
enough time in the midst of their other activities to fit it in. To avoid this issue,
the controller should schedule a monthly review of completed training to ensure
that all employees are meeting their training goals. Also, incorporate training
goals into the targets that employees must meet each year in order to be given
pay raises or bonuses. Further, the internal audit staff may also schedule an
occasional review of all training records to ensure that employees are indeed
completing their training work and not falsely reporting training hours that never
happened. When combined, all of these measures will ensure a thorough and
comprehensive training program that will improve employee knowledge, espe-
cially in regard to improving and managing systems, while also reducing the risk
of employee turnover.

14-27 Implement Cross-Training for Mission-Critical Activities

There are a number of crucial accounting activities that will cause a significant
amount of disturbance within a company if they are not completed on time, every
time. Examples of these activities are payroll, since employees will refuse to
work unless they are paid, and accounts payable, for suppliers will refuse to
provide additional goods and services unless they are paid. In these cases and
others, the greatest risk is that only one person knows how to process transac-
tions. If that person leaves the company or is incapacitated for any reason, there
can be a serious system failure that will quickly bring the entire company to a
grinding halt.

The best way to avoid this dependency on a single person is to implement
cross-training, using other accounting employees. By doing so, there is far less risk
that mission-critical activities will not be performed in a reliable manner, which
greatly reduces the chance that any key activity will not be completed on time. To
do so, there should be a schedule of key activities for which there is a listing of
required training elements. The controller should identify those personnel who are
most qualified to act as backups, put them through the training regimen, and ensure
that they receive continual retraining, so they can easily step into the needed jobs.
A small pay hike for those employees receiving cross-training will ensure their
enthusiastic participation in this system. The key factor to remember is that training
alone does not make for a good back-up person—only continual hands-on practice
under the direct tutelage of the person who is currently responsible for the work
will ensure that this best practice will work.


Summary 333

The only people who ever oppose this practice are those who are currently in
charge of mission-critical functions. This is because they feel more valuable if they
are the only ones who can complete a task and will feel less useful if there is
someone else who can also do the same work. Overcoming this problem requires a
great deal of tact and diplomacy. Sometimes they continue to be hostile to the
concept and must be removed to other positions while their replacements figure out
the system without any support at all. These are difficult alternatives, but must be
followed through if there is to be an adequate degree of cross-training in key
functional areas.

Summary

This chapter covered a number of best practices that address problems in the areas
of management, reporting, systems, taxation, and training.

Many best practices covered issues in the area of management, with principal
recommendations addressing the need to reconfigure the accounting department to
be more efficient.

Other best practices focused on the use of systems to aggregate contract terms
information and to track key types of accounting knowledge. The result should be
more efficient contract tracking, as well as better utilization of the knowledge
contained within the department.

We also strongly recommend the use of training to enhance the performance
of the department. At the lowest level of competence, there should be a formal
training program for all accounting employees. At a more advanced level, there
should be comprehensive cross-training so that employees can easily substitute for
each other as required by the ever-changing workload within the department.

General Ledger
Best Practices

In most of this book, the primary basis for best practices is simplification in order to
achieve an enhanced level of efficiency. Though there are best practices that can
streamline the general ledger in a similar manner, this is one of the rare cases where
pursuing a higher degree of complexity will sometimes achieve a greater overall
benefit for the entire company. The two best practices that follow this approach are
restructuring the general ledger to allow for the use of activity-based costing, and
using it as a data warehouse. In both cases, there are significant start-up costs and
much more work for the accounting staff, but the level of information that this
practice provides to the rest of the organization is greatly enhanced. Thus, there are
a few situations where greater cost and complexity can be beneficial.

In addition, there are the usual streamlining actions to reduce the work needed
to maintain the general ledger. These best practices include restricting the use of
journal entries and simplifying the chart of accounts. Though these measures will
certainly reduce the work of the general ledger accountant, you should strongly
consider adding the best practices for activity-based costing and data warehousing,
which will increase that person’s work, because it will be so beneficial to the
remainder of the company.

This chapter covers best practices for the general ledger function, as well as a
series of implementation issues for each best practice, which are discussed in the
next section.

Implementation Issues for General Ledger Best Practices

This section describes the general level of implementation difficulty for all of the
best practices discussed in this chapter. Two levels of implementation difficulty are
covered in Exhibit 15.1, which shows the general level of cost and duration to
implement each best practice.

In general, the level of implementation difficulty is higher for general ledger
best practices than for other functional areas because changes in this area either
involve some programming work or significant alterations to the way in which a
company conducts its business. For example, one best practice is to switch the

chart of accounts over to a structure that will allow a company to accumulate
information for an activity-based costing system more easily; however, altering the
chart of accounts always involves setting up new methods for collecting data,
which can require major procedural changes throughout a company. In short, since
the general ledger is the core data collection point in a company, alterations to it
will have a ripple effect that may impact distant corners of the organization that the
change initiator never anticipated.

Though many of the implementations listed in Exhibit 15.1 are described as
being of long duration or expensive, many of them can still be cost-effective ways
to improve the efficiency of the accounting department. However, given the
potential costs, it is mandatory, in this functional area, above all others, that a
controller conduct a thorough investigation and comparison of the costs and

benefits associated with any best practice—related changes. An implementation
should proceed only after this step has been taken.

15-1 Eliminate Small-Balance Accounts

If the general ledger accountant is in the habit of maintaining a record of all the
transactions in all accounts, there can be a considerable workload in store if there are
many accounts. This practice is particularly common for balance sheet accounts,
where it is necessary to keep track of all asset and liability records so that they can be
reviewed during the year-end audit. If there are fewer accounts, there is less
maintenance work needed to update a listing of the detailed records in each account.

Accordingly, a minor and easily implemented best practice is to periodically
review the balances in the balance sheet accounts and merge them into larger
accounts if the current balances are quite small. This task can be included in the
financial statement preparation procedure as a standard item so that someone
reviews the size of accounts on a regular basis and eliminates a few as necessary.
There are no downsides to this best practice since it requires minimal work, reduces
the clutter in the balance sheet, and does not interfere with the proper recording of
information.

15-2 Modify Account Code Structure for Storage
of ABC Information

The general ledger accountant is frequently drawn into any activity-based costing
(ABC) project because of his or her knowledge of the existing account structure.
This accountant is commonly asked to set up a mapping program that translates the
regular chart of accounts into a different (sometimes much different) chart of
accounts that will be used to compile information for an ABC analysis. This
analysis then compiles the costs of various products or activities throughout the
company, which usually results in better management decisions and a greater level
of profitability. Though this sounds like a reasonable task, involvement in an ABC
project requires a startlingly large amount of time, perhaps even full-time
participation for a number of months. The reason for such a heavy involvement
is that the existing chart of accounts rarely accumulates data in the same way that
an ABC analysis requires. For example, a traditional chart of accounts stores
expense information by department, whereas an ABC system needs to have this
information stored by activity center (such as a machine). Thus, when an ABC
system is installed, the general ledger accountant may not only expect a consider-
able increase in the current workload, but may even require a replacement to fill in
for all previous work while the ABC project is continuing.


338 General Ledger Best Practices

A possible solution to this change in workload is to alter the chart of accounts, at
least in part, so that information is stored in the manner the ABC system uses. By
storing information in the ABC format right away, there is no need for the general
ledger accountant to spend additional time reformatting it. This can be quite a difficult
best practice to implement, for several reasons. First, it requires the transfer of expense
information from old accounts to new ones, as well as the alteration of all entries to the
general ledger so that all new information is redirected in a similar manner. Also, all
reports derived from the general ledger must be altered so that they draw information
from the new accounts instead. The greatest problem of all is that the recipients of the
revised reports may not be at all pleased to find that the information they are
accustomed to receiving has been substantially altered. For example, a department
manager may find that there is no longer a department expense report, but instead an
expense report grouped by machine. The best way around all of these difficulties is to
set up automatic distributions within the general ledger so that expenses are still routed
to the same accounts, but the accounts are then allocated out to a different set of ABC
accounts for further ABC analysis. Unfortunately, the account allocation feature is not
normally available in less expensive general ledger software packages, so this option is
usually only available to larger corporations. A lesser alternative is to alter just a small
portion of general ledger accounts so that they can be used for ABC work, leaving the
main accounts as they are and relying on a manual conversion of data for these
accounts. This approach has the advantage of not altering the existing financial reports
to any significant degree, but still requires a considerable amount of work by the
general ledger accountant.

Despite all of the problems with converting the general ledger format to
accommodate an ABC system, this is still worthwhile in many cases. Though there
is no increase in efficiency for the general ledger function (quite the contrary), there
will be a rapid and smooth flow of information into the ABC system, which will
result in better management decisions, which in turn will have a direct impact on
the profitability of the entire organization.

15-3 Create Alphanumeric Department/Subsidiary Codes

The usual account code structure includes a four- or five-digit code that represents
the main account, a hyphen, and then a two- or three-digit code that represents a
department or subsidiary. Common usage states that these department and
subsidiary codes be numeric. For example, the travel expense code might be
63000, with additional department digits that look like this:

* 63000-100 = Travel expense, administration department
* 63000-200 = Travel expense, engineering department
* 63000-300 = Travel expense, sales department


15-4 Reduce the Chart of Accounts 339

Alternatively, for a “flat file’ chart of accounts that contains multiple
companies, the travel expense code might look like this:

¢ 63000-100 = Travel expense, Gerber Geriatrics
¢ 63000-200 = Travel expense, Highline Supplies

¢ 63000-300 = Travel expense, Innovative Solutions

In both cases, the person entering journal entries or transactions must know the
meaning of the department or subsidiary codes, which are not entirely obvious. The
accounting software may reveal the account name in a byline, but the data-entry
person has to glance at the byline to see it. If the person does not verify the accuracy
of her entry, then it’s entirely possible that she will code the transaction into the
wrong department or subsidiary. Although most companies avoid this difficulty by
assigning specific expense codes to vendor files and by using prebuilt recurring
journal entries, there is still a significant risk that the use of purely numeric codes
will result in incorrect charges to the wrong departments or subsidiaries.

The solution is simple enough. Many accounting software packages allow for
the use of alphanumeric account codes, which allow one to assign meaning to a
code. Even contracting a department name into a three-digit code leaves lots of
room for meaning. To use the previous example for department coding, 63000—100
becomes 63000-ADM. Unless a company employs admirals, the obvious implica-
tion is that this is the administration department. Similarly for the subsidiary coding
example, the obscure 63000-300 becomes 63000-INN, which would lead a user to
conclude that it involves the Innovative Solutions subsidiary.

15-4 Reduce the Chart of Accounts

All too many organizations are burdened with an immense chart of accounts.
Instead of having a short list of accounts in which to store information—such as
100 or 200 accounts—many organizations have a convoluted and lengthy chart of
accounts. The sheer length of such a list introduces a number of problems into the
general ledger function. First, it is difficult to put numbers into the same accounts
consistently time after time. Instead, they are recorded in different accounts,
resulting in very poor comparability of information across time. Second, it can be
very difficult to train a new general ledger accountant in the use of a very
complicated chart of accounts; during the training period, it is likely that the
accountant will make mistakes in recording financial information into the correct
accounts, resulting in inaccurate financial statements. Third, it is also more
expensive to audit a long chart of accounts since the outside auditors must spend
more time reviewing more accounts. Finally, writing a new report with general
ledger information is quite difficult if the information is being drawn from a


340 General Ledger Best Practices

veritable maze of accounts. In short, a plague of problems accompanies an
excessively long chart of accounts.

The solution is one that takes a fair amount of work to implement. Though it
seems simple—just reduce the number of active accounts in the chart of
accounts—there are ancillary issues that require additional work. One problem
with reducing the chart is that users may still continue to code expenses to the old
accounts, if only out of habit. To stop this from happening, the old accounts that are
being retired must be blocked from further use in the computer system. Though
most computer systems now have this blocking feature, it is useful to determine its
presence before proceeding further with an implementation. Another issue is that
when the chart is reduced, it is much more difficult to create historical reports to
compare account balances to those of previous periods. For example, if five
accounts are merged into one consolidated account, it is difficult to show how the
balance in the new account compares to the old balances in five accounts. There is
no good way around this problem, unless the existing accounting software has a
reporting feature that allows old accounts to be grouped for comparison purposes.
This is a particular problem if the accounts are merged in the middle of a
company’s reporting year so that it is not even possible to compare financial
results from month to month. The best solution to this problem is to undertake
major chart of account conversions only at the very beginning of a reporting year
so that there is no intrayear reporting problem. Another way to resolve the problem
is to fix the chart of accounts over a number of years by eliminating only a small
number of accounts each year, which does not impact the comparability of
accounts in any one year to any great degree. A final issue is that information
may be stored in an account strictly for inclusion in a report that has some special
purpose; if the account is discontinued, the report can no longer be completed,
which may be a source of irritation to the report recipient. To avoid this issue, it is
necessary to review all reports generated from the general ledger and determine
which accounts are used to create them. If the information in these special accounts
is truly indispensable, they should be left alone.

Though a number of problems have been noted that can arise when the chart of
accounts is streamlined, this is still a best practice immensely worthy of consider-
ation. It is especially useful for older companies with many departments or
subsidiaries, for these have frequently accumulated a large number of stray
accounts over the years that should certainly be researched and eliminated. By
doing so, it is much easier to maintain the general ledger.

15-5 Use Identical Chart of Accounts for Subsidiaries

If a company has a number of subsidiaries, the general ledger accountant will have
a much more difficult time at the end of the financial reporting period, because the


15-5 Use Identical Chart of Accounts for Subsidiaries 341

results of each subsidiary must be translated into the chart of accounts structure of
the corporate parent. This can involve an enormous amount of work, because the
information the subsidiaries send in may be in a chart of accounts structure that is
so different from the one the parent uses that it is a matter of pure guesswork by the
accountant to determine the correct accounts into which the subsidiary data should
be recorded. This is a particularly galling problem if the subsidiaries are in an
entirely different line of business, for this means that the chart of accounts may be
substantially different; thus, consolidating account numbers is more of a problem if
a company acquires disparate companies, as opposed to acquiring companies that
are in the same industry.

There are several variations on the same best practice that will resolve
this problem, as noted in the following bullet points. They range from merely
requiring the permission of the corporate parent before a subsidiary alters
its chart of accounts any further to requiring the substitution of the existing
chart with the one the corporate parent uses. The bullet points are listed
in ascending order of conformance, with the least amount of conformance
being the easiest to implement and complete conformance being the most
difficult to install. The particular variation selected may be dependent on the
speed with which a company is buying other companies, since a complete
replacement of a chart of accounts is a major undertaking and may not be
possible if the rate of acquisition is extremely rapid. The best practice options
are as follows:

¢ Require permission to make account changes. It may be necessary to leave
the current situation alone, perhaps because there are too many subsidiaries
and too few resources available to reset the chart of accounts structure across
all subsidiaries. In this situation, the easiest step is to issue a blanket order to
all subsidiaries that they cannot make further changes to their charts of
accounts without permission from the corporate parent—in other words, the
main action is not to make the situation any worse than it already is. This is an
extremely minor action to take, since it is a rare event for a company to create
new accounts once the basic chart of accounts has been completed. See the
following best practice for more information.

¢ Use a written map to lay out how accounts are linked. A more advanced
level of activity, which can also incorporate the first bullet point, is to create
a map that traces each account number used by every subsidiary to the
corresponding account number in the corporate parent’s chart of accounts.
Though only a manual tool, not an automated one, this is still an important
way to create consistent entries through many accounting periods. To make
this approach even more effective, there should be a standardized journal-
entry form for each subsidiary that lists both sets of account numbers, so the
general ledger accountant only has to fill in the form and enter it into the
computer.


342 General Ledger Best Practices

¢ Have subsidiaries convert results to corporate parent’s chart of accounts.
An excellent approach for organizations that do not like to impose an
excessive level of control onto their subsidiaries is to let them use any
account code structure that they want and just require them to make the
conversion to the parent’s chart of accounts when submitting period-end
information. This approach is a benign one many companies use, for it avoids
the effort of a complete standardization while still ensuring that the parent
company receives the information it needs. It can also be completed in short
order, merely requiring a visit from corporate headquarters to work with the
local accounting staff to create an account code conversion table the local staff
will use to submit data to the corporate parent.

¢ Have subsidiaries enter their data directly into the parent’s general
ledger. This approach is similar to the preceding one in that the subsidiaries
can keep their own charts of accounts but must submit their reporting
information in the corporate parent’s format. The difference here is that
the subsidiaries are given computer access to the corporate parent’s general
ledger, into which they are expected to enter the period-end data themselves.
This approach presents the risk of someone entering incorrect information into
the computer system but avoids the need for extra data-entry work by the
corporate general ledger accountant. Instead, the people entering the infor-
mation are the ones who know the most about it, which means that there is less
likelihood of a conversion or data-entry error being made. This best practice is
described in more detail later, in best practice 15-12, “Have Subsidiaries
Update Their Own Data in the Central General Ledger.”

¢ Convert all subsidiaries to a common chart of accounts. The best way to
ensure complete standardization is to impose the chart of accounts of the
parent onto the subsidiaries. This can involve a massive amount of work, for
each accounting system must be reset to use the new accounts. This may also
probably destroy all historical reporting comparisons, which must use the old
account numbers. Some subsidiaries may also be in such a different line of
business that the new chart of accounts is quite unsuitable for recording
information, requiring the accounting staff to “shoehorn” data into accounts
that do not agree exactly with the account descriptions. Many companies find
this approach to be much too difficult and expensive to be worthwhile and will
use one of the preceding options instead.

Thus, there is quite a range of options available for converting the chart of
accounts of a subsidiary to that of the parent. The exact option taken will depend on
the level of effort and resources that the parent is willing to put into this effort. Some
of the easier options are quite as reliable as the most difficult, making them worthy of
careful consideration when picking from the range of options presented here.

15-7 Use Data Warehouse for Report Distribution 343

15-6 Require Senior Approval to Add Accounts

When a multisubsidiary company allows its subsidiaries to use their own charts of
accounts, this presents problems for the corporate accounting staff, which must
map each subsidiary account to the corporate chart of accounts for consolidation
purposes. Whenever a subsidiary adds an account, the corporate staff usually
becomes aware of it in the midst of the period-end closing process, when there is
little time to consider how the change should be integrated into the corporate chart
of accounts.

One solution is to create a strictly enforced procedure, under which the
corporate controller is the only person allowed to approve the addition of accounts
at the subsidiary level. Local controllers should be required to complete a standard
application for each new account, on which they state the following:

¢ The reason for the new account.
¢ Why any existing accounts cannot be used.

¢ Whether the expected account activity will be large enough to warrant having
the account.

¢ The corporate account to which the new account should be mapped.

The corporate controller can use this more structured approach to minimize
the number of new accounts that are created. At a minimum, the approval process
should give the corporate accounting staff sufficient time to map the account to the
corporate chart of accounts for consolidation purposes.

15-7 Use Data Warehouse for Report Distribution

Larger organizations, especially those with multiple locations or subsidiaries,
commonly expend a great deal of time compiling and distributing reports to
employees. This problem arises because each location frequently has its own
general ledger, from which the information is drawn. If any of the information from
multiple locations is to be combined to create summary-level reports, then either a
custom interface must be built to combine the data or else it must be manually
combined and inserted into a new report.

An excellent method for avoiding this trouble is to dump selected data from all
of the general ledgers into a central data warehouse. This involves the use of many
customized interfaces that pull the data out of outlying locations and store it into
the data warehouse so that it contains only the most current information. Then a set
of reporting programs frequently (perhaps every few minutes, depending on how it
would downgrade system performance) accesses the data warehouse to refresh the


344 General Ledger Best Practices

information stored in a set of standard reports, which in turn are made available to
employees through the company intranet.

This elaborate shifting and recompiling of data results in very “fresh” data that
employees can use at once, and takes the accounting department completely out of
the business of repetitively compiling reports—though it may still be asked to
create new reports for posting to the intranet site. A key change after this system is
installed is that the accounting staff will find itself spending much more time
cleaning up the data that goes into the data warehouse. The reason is that manually
compiled reports give the accounting staff time to review the data and fix any
obvious anomalies before they reach the user; however, this automated reporting
system does not allow the accounting staff this luxury, so now its focus must shift
toward ensuring that the data is always correct.

A different approach to the data warehouse is noted in best practice 15-9,
“Use the General Ledger as a Data Warehouse,” later in this chapter, where you can
see that extra data can be added to an existing general ledger, rather than exporting
the general ledger to a separate database. This alternative is more usable in
situations where there is only one general ledger in use, and so is more applicable
to smaller companies.

15-8 Use Forms/Rates Data Warehouse for Automated Tax Filings

Any organization that operates in a number of states will find that an inordinate
number of sales and income tax returns must be filed, not to mention a plethora of
lesser forms. The traditional way to meet these filing requirements is to either keep
a staff of tax preparation personnel on hand or else outsource some or all of these
chores to a supplier. Either approach represents a significant cost. An alternative
worth exploring is to store tax rates and forms in a database that can be used to
automatically prepare tax returns in conjunction with other accounting information
that is stored in either a general ledger or a data warehouse.

To make this best practice operational, there must first be a common database
containing all of the information that would normally be included on a tax return.
This may call for some restructuring of the chart of accounts, as well as the
centralization of companywide data into a data warehouse (see the preceding best
practice). This is no small task, since the information needed by each state may
vary slightly from the requirements of other states, calling for subtle changes in the
storage of data throughout the organization that will yield the appropriate
information for reporting purposes.

The next step is to obtain tax rate information and store it in a central database.
This information can be manually located by accessing the tax agency web sites of
all 50 states but is more easily obtained in electronic format from any of the
national tax reporting services. This information can then be stored in the


15-9 Use the General Ledger as a Data Warehouse 345

forms/rates data warehouse. An additional step is to create a separate program for
each of the tax reports so that a computer report is issued that mimics the reporting
format used by each state. Then the information can be manually transferred from
the computer report to a printout of the PDF file of each state’s tax form. For those
programming staffs with a large amount of available time, it is also possible to
create a report format that exactly mirrors each state tax form and that can be
printed, with all tax information enclosed within it, and immediately mailed out.

The trouble with this best practice is the exceptionally high programming cost
associated with obtaining an automated solution. There are so many tax forms to be
converted to a digital format that the development task is considerable. Accord-
ingly, it is more cost effective to determine those tax forms that share approxi-
mately the same information and to develop an automated solution for them first.
Any remaining tax forms requiring special programming to automate should be
reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine if it is cost beneficial to complete
further programming work or to leave a few stray reports for the tax preparation
staff to complete by hand.

15-9 Use the General Ledger as a Data Warehouse

When issuing financial reports, a controller draws all of the financial information
from a single source, the general ledger. However, there are usually a number of
operating statistics, such as headcount, turnover percentages, scrap, and the like
that must be accumulated from a variety of sources before they can be brought
together into a coherent group and inserted into the financial statements. These can
be quite difficult to accumulate at the last moment and must be added manually to
the financial statements since they are not stored in the general ledger, the primary
source from which the statements are drawn. The reporting problem becomes
worse if management is accustomed to printing financial reports on its own,
for any operating statistics will not appear on them, necessitating a sudden and
unscheduled accumulation of this information by the accounting staff in order to
supplement the existing reports. Thus, nonfinancial data can introduce some
inefficiency into the production of financial statements.

The solution is to create additional records in the general ledger for the storage
of nonfinancial information. This is more commonly known as a data warehouse,
since data of all kinds can be stored there. When in place, this arrangement allows a
company to store all the operating data it desires in the same place as its financial
data, which means that any reports accessing financial data can automatically
include operating data as well. Since all possible information is listed on the
reports, there is no need to supplement them with additional, manually compiled
reports. This is a much more satisfactory state of affairs since all information
and reporting is centralized.


346 General Ledger Best Practices

There are some problems with changing a general ledger into a data ware-
house. One is that the existing software may not allow for this arrangement; if the
software is provided by a third party and regularly updated, there may be no way to
alter the situation without an appeal to the supplier to include a data warehousing
feature in its next update of the software. Second, the existing financial reports
must be altered to include the new information that will now be stored in the
general ledger. A third issue is deciding who will update the operations informa-
tion and how it will be added to the general ledger. For example, if it is deemed
necessary to record the monthly inventory turnover rate at each of a dozen
facilities, who will collect and input this data? The answer is usually either to
allow each department or facility to forward this information, have the internal
audit team (which is more objective in reporting disappointing results) do it, or
have the former do it with periodic reviews by the latter. It may also be possible
either to give these people direct access to the statistics accounts in the general
ledger so they can make these entries themselves or (best of all) to construct
automated interfaces to whichever local systems are already accumulating this
information.

Thus, the main problem is not having a general ledger that will accommodate
the data warehousing concept; the other problems are either surmounted during the
implementation or can be eliminated through automation or bringing in the
assistance of the internal audit department. If these problems can be overcome,
using the general ledger as a data warehouse becomes an effective way to manage
and report on all kinds of key management information.

15-10 Restrict Use of Journal Entries

Many general ledger accountants spend a large part of their time researching why
journal entries have been made. This is an especially galling problem if journal
entries were made by someone else, because there may be no record of why they
were entered or even of who made the entry. Also, if the computer system has a
drill-down capability for researching general ledger information in detail, an
information search may end at the journal entry, with no explanation for why
the entry was made. This is an uncomfortable state of affairs for a general ledger
accountant, who must report back to anyone requesting information from the
general ledger saying that he or she does not know the nature of an account
balance. Besides being embarrassing, it also takes time to research.

An easy solution is to totally restrict the use of journal entries to the general
ledger accountant. By doing so, this person can research each request for a journal
entry to verify that it is valid, make sure that the correct accounts are debited and
credited, and include a description with the journal entry. This approach virtually
eliminates all stray or undocumented journal entries from the system. Though it

should not cause any problems, it may be difficult to implement if the computer
system does not allow the journal entry feature to be restricted to one person—this
depends on the type of computer security system included in the software.
Restricting the use of journal entries leads to cleaner and more fully
documented general ledger information that is maintained much more easily.

15-11 Avoid General Ledger Posting Bottlenecks

If a company has a number of subsidiaries that forward journal entries to it for
posting, this can create a bottleneck in the general ledger area, which can be a
particular problem during the monthly closing process since this could become the
prime bottleneck interfering with a timely close.

The potential range of solutions stretches from increasing the corporate
general ledger staff to pushing these transactions down onto the accounting staffs
of the subsidiaries. Here are some thoughts on how to deal with the issue:

1. Normally, it makes sense to centralize journal entries with the smallest
number of general ledger accountants, since they are experts in making
such entries, and can therefore minimize journal-entry errors and
duplications.

2. Since general ledger entries have become a bottleneck operation, there are
two choices: beef up the corporate general ledger data entry capacity, or push
some or all of it back onto the divisions. Here are the ramifications of each:

¢ Adding more corporate general ledger staff requires a greater expense, and
since accounting is a cost center, this approach will not go over well with
the chief financial officer (CFO) if there are any viable alternatives that do
not increase costs. However, this will result in greater control over the
accuracy of the entries being made.

¢ If the journal-entry volume only somewhat exceeds the capacity of the
general ledger staff to handle it, then consider shifting smaller, less
consequential entries back onto the divisions while retaining responsibil-
ity for all remaining entries. This will require the company to open access
to its accounting software journal-entry capability, so more people will
have the ability to make entries, which will probably increase the error
rate. However, by restricting the divisions to only the easier and smaller
dollar—volume entries, it will be less likely for them to make erroneous
entries. This is probably the best option in most situations.

¢ If there is a general desire by the corporate accounting staff to unload the
whole general ledger data entry function onto the divisions, be aware that error
rates will increase, which will call for the use of more training at the division

level, as well as procedures, error checking, and probably an occasional
internal audit. Because of all these factors, this is a less viable option.

15-12 Have Subsidiaries Update Their Own Data
in the Central General Ledger

A lengthy task for any general ledger accountant who must consolidate the results
of subsidiaries is to input the general ledger of each one into the general ledger of
the corporate parent. This can be a lengthy and arduous task, as well as one that is
easily subject to error. The typical consolidation requires a very large journal entry
for each subsidiary, possibly requiring over a hundred accounts. If there is any
problem with the data entry, the entire entry must be reviewed to find the mistake.
If there are many subsidiaries, there are many entries to make; if there is a time
crunch associated with producing financial statements, it is extremely likely that all
of the data-entry work required of the general ledger accountant will be a
bottleneck for the timely production of those statements.

A solution is to hand the data-entry chore over to the subsidiaries. They can be
given access to the computer system of the corporate parent, as well as password
access to the general ledger, and then enter their financial results directly into the
computer system. The general ledger accountant thereby avoids all data-entry
work related to the subsidiaries and only has to analyze his or her own data inputs
to see if there are any unusual items. By having each subsidiary enter its own
information, the data can be entered much more quickly, resulting in the
elimination of the workflow bottleneck associated with this task. In short, a
relatively simple system change can improve the efficiency of periodic corporate
consolidations.

There are a few issues to consider before attempting this best practice,
however. First, there must be password protection for anyone accessing the
main computer system, since there is always a risk of someone hacking into
the computer and destroying or accessing sensitive data. Another issue is that by
giving access to many people, the number of users accessing the system at one time
may rise, which may require the purchase of additional user licenses (if the system
is a third-party package that uses a licensing fee arrangement). Finally, all the new
users must be trained in how to make a journal entry in the corporate computer
system, which may require nothing more than an instruction sheet, but which may
require travel to all locations to conduct a short training class. If all of these issues
can be dealt with at minimal cost, then having subsidiaries enter their own data into
the corporate general ledger can improve the efficiency of that function.

Summary 349

15-13 Prescreen Construction-in-Progress Entries

A great many entries are made to construction-in-progress (CIP) accounts, because
a vast number of expense items are required as part of the standard construction
progress. However, the sheer volume of entries makes it an opportune area in
which to park expenses that should instead be charged to the current period, rather
than to a CIP account that may not commence depreciation for over a year.

To avoid this problem, prescreen CIP-related entries when they are first
entered into the system. This screening process can take on one of two roles. First,
it can result in items being shifted away from the CIP account and charged to
expense at once, because they do not qualify under generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) rules to be included in CIP. Second, the screening process can
be used as a tracking mechanism for the entire CIP, but it shunts items to be
charged to current period expenses into one subaccount, while qualified CIP
expenses are stored in a separate subaccount. This latter approach has the dual
advantages of ensuring that the correct costs are charged to expense within the
current period, while still accumulating all costs related to a CIP.

There should be only one or a few people assigned to this gatekeeper role,
because it needs to be occupied by a person with an extensive knowledge of GAAP
CIP rules. If cost constraints do not allow for a person in the prescreening role, then
at least have the internal audit staff conduct the same sort of examination on a spot-
check basis.

Summary

This chapter discussed a variety of best practices for the general ledger function.
Though many of them will reduce the workload of the general ledger accountant by
streamlining the workflow and reducing the number of errors that can enter into the
process, a few can be both difficult and expensive to implement. Some, such as
using the general ledger to support activity-based costing, will make the general
ledger accountant’s job more difficult, rather than less. Accordingly, for most
general ledger best practices, it is necessary to ensure that there will be sufficient
payback in exchange for installing a new best practice. The payback is not just
greater accounting efficiency, but in a few cases the provision of better information
to the rest of the company.

Internal Auditing
Best Practices

A traditional internal auditing department is frequently considered to be similar to
the external auditors who annually review the corporate financial records, except
that they also deal with operational and control issues and are more frequently
found in the field. Since internal auditors are commonly hired from external audit
firms, it is no surprise that they are likely to bring their old work habits with them
and conduct the reviews just noted. However, as is pointed out many times in this
chapter, the internal auditor’s role can be viewed quite differently, switching from
a systems reviewer to an active partner who can bring tremendous value to a
company’s business units. Thus, many of the best practices noted in this chapter
focus on the revised role of auditors acting as business partners.

Another strong focus in this chapter is on the enhancement of work efficien-
cies within the internal audit department, which tends to suffer from continual
deadline crises, unfinished paperwork, and difficulty determining which audits
need to be addressed first. Examples of recommended changes involve the use of
workflow software to centralize paperwork-related issues, shifting some tasks to
business unit employees, and creating an auditor skills matrix.

This chapter begins with an overview of implementation issues for all of the
internal auditing best practices, followed by a discussion of individual best
practices, each one being presented in a separate section.

16-1 Annually Update an Internal Control Assessment 353

department. However, a number of the best practices require a modest investment
of time, such as performing annual internal control assessments, creating self-audit
guides, and training business unit employees on training issues. Thus, implement-
ing these best practices will require detailed management by the internal audit
manager to see when auditor time can be made available to complete the various
work items. The cost and installation time required for all the best practices in this
chapter are noted in Exhibit 16.1.

The glaring exception to the low-cost rule is the use of workflow software,
which can easily cost well into the six figures and also require a considerable
amount of time to install, which may put it out of reach of most smaller internal
auditing departments.

One best practice is to outsource the internal audit department, though all the
other recommendations in this chapter assume that the department will be retained.
Outsourcing is only useful in those cases where a company does not feel that
internal auditing is a core company function, and where it either can afford the
substantially increased cost of shifting this area to an outside audit firm or where it
conducts so few internal audits that it requires less than one full-time person to
conduct the work.

Consequently, with few exceptions, implementing the best practices in this
chapter can result in significant improvements not only in the usefulness of the
internal audit department but also in the efficiency with which it conducts its
operations.

16-1 Annually Update an Internal Control Assessment
of Each Business Unit

It is not uncommon for an internal audit department to continually send its auditors
into the field with instructions to review whatever was done in the work papers
from the year before, thereby bringing continual attention to the same risks, year
after year. Though this approach certainly informs those being audited of the areas
requiring strong controls, it does not account for changes in the business that may
require different audit work.

An alternative is to periodically create a formal internal control assessment
document, both for the entire company and for individual business units. The
assessment points out changes in the business and how they will impact controls,
as well as the status of existing controls and why those controls are needed.
This document can then be sent to the senior management team to promote
their understanding of emerging control issues, as well as to business unit
managers, who will therefore have a greater understanding of which controls
are likely to be subject to review by internal audit teams. Of particular
importance to the audit manager is this document’s usefulness in determining
how control reviews must change from year to year in order to schedule more
effective audits.


354 Internal Auditing Best Practices

The assessment will require a substantial amount of time to prepare and revise,
but the time investment is easily offset by the greater understanding of control issues.

16-2 Issue Self-Audit Guides to Business Units

Many of the best practices noted in this chapter involve the conversion of the
internal audit staff from reviewers of controls to advisers who impart knowledge
about business improvements. However, this shift in emphasis means that the
traditional task of reviewing controls will be done much less frequently.

An alternative is to shift some of the controls review burden to the business
units themselves. Though this may seem like a case of having the fox guard the
henhouse, the internal audit department can still monitor business unit results at a
high level to see if general operational and financial performance measures indicate
a problem, and then send in a team to conduct a thorough review. In most cases,
there are no serious control breakdowns, so audit tasks with lower-risk profiles can
be safely assigned to business unit employees. By doing so, there is greater
likelihood of audits being conducted on a regular basis, and by people who are
thoroughly familiar at a detailed level with business processes, which may result in
better audit work.

To make this shift of responsibilities a success, the internal audit department
should construct a series of self-audit guides for the business units. These guides
should briefly explain a control objective, note how specific controls are used
within a process to meet that objective, and then lay out detailed auditing steps for
employees to follow. The level of detail in these guides should be sufficient for
employees without audit training to understand what they are doing and why it is
important. The guides should be short, concise, and targeted only at specific audit
objectives. Also, they must avoid any accounting language that might be confusing
to a nonaccountant. When creating a self-audit guide, be sure to test it on a
nonaccountant to see where points of confusion arise so that any problems can be
eliminated before the guide is released for general use. Though a great deal of work
is required to create an effective self-audit guide, the effort expended will be more
than offset by the eventual reduction in control review work by the audit staff.

16-3 Recommend Business Process Improvements
to Business Units

The traditional function of the internal auditor has been to diligently root through a
business unit’s processes, looking for control weaknesses or evidence of fraud. If


16-4 Track Audit Results through Business Unit Surveys 355

anything was found, it cast the business unit manager in a poor light. Given this
sequence of events, it should be no surprise that internal auditors are not usually
welcomed by joyous crowds of auditees.

A much better approach is to mix the chore of control reviews with making
suggestions to the business unit managers for process improvements. The internal
auditor is in an ideal position to do this, having an expert knowledge of business
processes, as well as a comparative knowledge of how the same processes are
handled in other parts of the company. Indeed, the internal auditor can be
considered a walking encyclopedia of control process best practices. By shifting
to a focus on valuable improvement recommendations, the internal auditor creates
an entirely different image within the corporation of being a helpful knowledge
worker who can make local managers look like stars. This is a particularly
important change in focus if the internal auditor can either make additional
recommendations in regard to implementation steps for process improvements
or bring the local manager in contact with the in-house expert who has already
completed an implementation. By taking this approach, you can not only be the
source of ideas but also assist in carrying them out in an indirect manner.

Though control reviews are still necessary to some extent in all organizations,
taking this different view of the position can result in business unit managers
begging the internal audit manager for more staff time to assist them with a variety
of tasks.

16-4 Track Audit Results through Business Unit Surveys

Although auditors must sometimes issue adverse opinions about the state of
process controls at a corporate business unit, this does not lead to long-lasting or
friendly relations with those business units, which has ramifications in terms of
cooperation from the business units when follow-up audits are conducted at a later
date.

Some of these adversarial circumstances can be avoided through the use of
business unit surveys in which the unit managers are given the opportunity to
review audit performance in terms of their perceived relevance, value of recom-
mendations made, accuracy of audit findings, and so on. If a survey results in
excessively poor scores, the internal audit manager can meet with the unit manager
to gain clarification about the issues, which may result in steps to improve auditing
goals, processes, or staffing. By continually obtaining survey results and acting on
them, the internal audit department can align its mission more closely with that of
the business units, resulting in greater value to the business units. This approach
can also be used as an ancillary rating measure for internal audit staff performance,
as well as a method for determining which unit managers need to be dealt with
more carefully during upcoming audits.


356 Internal Auditing Best Practices

The results of these surveys should be stored and tracked on a trend line for
several years to gain some idea of the perceived level of performance by the
department. The survey database can also be sorted by audit team, business unit,
and type of audit program conducted, to see if issues continually arise in any of
these three areas that require corrective action.

16-5 Train Business Unit Staff on Control Issues

Many control problems arise because employees do not understand the impact of
the improper usage of a control. They simply see it as an extra step to be followed
or an inefficiency that can be overcome by altering the process. When internal
auditors spot this type of problem, they usually report it to management, which
must somehow find the time and resources to train employees in the proper use of
the control. Since this training is not budgeted, it frequently does not occur,
resulting in continuing control problems.

The internal auditor can mitigate this problem by setting aside time at the
end of each audit to personally provide the necessary level of training. This will
require extra time, so some padding must be added to the audit time budget to
allow for training. Also, it is most helpful for the internal audit department to
have a set of training guides on major topical areas prepared in advance, and
readily accessible by all auditors for use. These guides should cover processes
and controls in all major areas that are common to multiple business units, such
as inventory transactions, order fulfillment, the purchasing process, and travel
expense reporting. Though this best practice will require more auditor time than
is usually the case, it helps to reduce the number of control problems that will be
found during subsequent audits, and so saves audit time in the long run. It is also
seen as a major benefit provided by the internal audit staff to the rest of the
company.

16-6 Train New Business Unit Managers on Control Issues

When new managers are assigned to a business unit, the last thing they want to see
is an internal auditor walking in the door to conduct a review. Their experience is
likely to be the uncovering of some shortfall in the control systems, resulting in a
black mark against them while they are still struggling to learn the details of their
jobs. In anticipation of this result, a new manager is likely to stonewall an internal
auditor in hopes of avoiding any negative findings.


16-7 Avoid Overauditing of Internal Audits 357

A more positive approach is for a senior-level internal auditor to meet with
each new manager as part of the initial job training and spend a great deal of time
discussing the control systems over which the manager now has responsibility.
This discussion should include a hands-on review of each process step where
control points are used, as well as conversations about the need for these controls,
how to ensure that they are being followed, and indicators of control failures. The
internal auditor can even point out other possible improvements in the manager’s
systems. By taking this approach, the internal auditor will be seen as a strong
adviser to new managers, and one with whom a long-standing and friendly
relationship can be forged that will assist in the conduct of future audits. This
approach completely contravenes the more adversarial situation that typically
arises between a new manager and an internal auditor.

16-7 Avoid Overauditing of Internal Audits

Many internal audits involve the repetitive review of the same topical areas, if only
because these areas are perceived to have the highest degree of financial risk to a
company, and so are worthy of constant review. When internal audits are repeated
on a regular basis, the managers of these audits will usually pull out the work
papers from the last audit that was conducted on the same area and simply copy out
the same auditing requirements. This can result in overauditing because the
internal audit manager never questions why each of the tasks needs to be
completed a second time. Many of the audit procedures noted in the work papers
may have been intended to be onetime reviews to investigate perceived problems
that have since been overcome with new control systems, rendering the original
audit steps no longer valid. Given this constant tendency to copy previous audits, a
nonessential audit step may have been repeated dozens of times, simply on the
grounds that if it was done before, it should be done again.

A better approach is to conduct a brief, formal review of the upcoming internal
audit with the internal audit team assigned to do the work. This group should
review the results of the last internal audit, pore over the control chart (if any) for
the area to be reviewed, and come up with a new audit plan for every engagement.
By doing so, the team avoids the mindless repetition of early audit steps that are no
longer valid, and concentrates on the key issues that will result in the most valuable
audit results. Also, by including the entire audit team in this review, a company will
find that there is much better buy-in to, and understanding of, the work being done,
which may both increase employee efficiency and reduce long-term turnover in the
internal audit staff.

358 Internal Auditing Best Practices

16-8 Complete All Internal Audit Work Papers in the Field

The objective of an internal audit is to complete a report that describes any control
issues found. However, one would think that, from the perspective of the internal
audit team, the objective would be to move on to the next internal audit as quickly
as possible. There is a preference among internal auditors to continually meet the
upcoming schedule to work on the next audit, rather than to complete the one
currently being conducted. This results in a long trail of incomplete audits that
requires constant badgering by senior management to complete, frequently
requiring weekend work by the internal audit teams. To avoid this problem,
the standard procedure for all internal audits should be that the work papers be fully
completed in the field before an internal audit team is allowed back to the main
office or to proceed to the next audit. Work paper completion should include the
clearing of all points that arose during the audit, as well as producing the draft
report. If this results in delays in the completion of subsequent internal audits, then
fine—it will also yield much more rapid completion of the final audit reports,
which was the objective when the audits were scheduled. This point can be made to
the audit teams more convincingly by issuing a small bonus for all the internal
audits that are wrapped up in the field.

16-9 Create a Control Standards Manual

Auditors are trained to have a good idea of which control standards should be
attached to a business process. However, the managers who supervise those
processes typically have no idea of which controls are involved. This can result in
inadvertent changes to processes by managers who are simply trying to devise
more efficient systems, which, in turn, results in adverse findings by auditors when
they conduct reviews.

A reasonable solution is to create a control standards manual for use by
process managers. The manual should note the internal control objectives to be
met for each business process, as well as the specific procedures used to meet
those objectives. The manual can also note how different control points support
each other, and what happens when specific controls are removed from the
process. The manual can include flowcharts of the processes, noting each control
point, as well as forms used in the process. Any reports arising from a process
should be noted, describing what information managers should review that can
bolster the control objectives. Clearly, this can be an exceedingly dry document
(except to internal auditors!), so an audit staff person should walk managers
through the manual to highlight its key points. Also, whenever an audit team
arrives for any type of review, it should always bring the latest version of the
control standards manual, making a point of highlighting key changes to it. Only

by this constant emphasis on the importance of the manual will managers take
the time to review and understand it.

16-10 Create an Online Internal Audit Library

An internal audit team will go on most audit engagements without a great deal of
company expertise to back it up. If the team encounters an unusual problem in the
field, it has no one to turn to for advice. Similarly, if it encounters a control
problem, it has no way of knowing if it is an isolated issue or if it has been
uncovered in other places within the company. These problems can be reduced by
setting up an online internal audit library that contains records from previous
completed audits, as well as who worked on them and how they can be accessed.
Further, the library can hold updates on all of the most recent accounting standards,
as well as cross-indexed data on problems or unusual audit scenarios encountered
during other company audits. By accessing this information, audit teams can save a
great deal of research time that would otherwise be spent combing through the
company directory or the paper-based audit files to find the same information.
Setting up such a system requires each internal audit manager to create an
electronic summary-level report on each audit as it is completed, which is then
forwarded to the company webmaster for inclusion in the library. Also, accounting
standards can be easily obtained from various CD-based products for posting on the
online library. Be sure to obtain an accounting standards product that contains an
index search capability so that users can easily search for items of particular interest.

16-11 Create and Disseminate Information from
a Best Practices Database

A large company will have many internal auditors combing through its processes in
many locations and possibly on multiple continents. These auditors will build a store
of knowledge about best practices that is based only on what they have seen, and
which they will likely recommend to other business units as they travel throughout
the company on various audit projects. Though this will result in the spread of best
practices through a company over time, it is a very inefficient way to do so—
knowledge will only be applicable if an auditor happens to be assigned to another
business unit whose processes could benefit from that person’s specific knowledge,
and it will be lost when an internal auditor retires or leaves employment.

A much better way to spread the use of best practices is to store the
information in a central database. It should be entered into the database as


360 Internal Auditing Best Practices

soon as an audit is completed; it can also be validated in terms of its effectiveness
by specifically reviewing its results during a repeat audit at a later date. Auditors
can also be given bonuses or recognition awards for any best practices they
uncover and store in the database, which will have them enthusiastically rooting
through business units to uncover new best practices.

Spreading information about these best practices can take several forms. The
most passive approach is to simply have it available in the database, but this
approach requires auditors to actively review the database in their limited spare
time. A better approach is to push the information into the field through the use of
newsletters and emails to the audit staff. A particularly effective approach is to
e-mail best practice information directly to those business unit managers who are
most likely to use them; by doing so, the managers are more likely to contact the
internal audit department with requests for assistance in installing the recom-
mended best practices. The driving force behind the success of best practices
dissemination is the use of someone who regularly reviews the best practices
database for “hot” topics, and who also spends time matching best practice
possibilities with various business units. In a small company, this work should
be done by the internal audit manager, though a larger company may choose to
assign the task to a full-time senior audit position to ensure that the company gains
the most benefit from its best practices database.

16-12 Outsource the Internal Audit Function

Some organizations have their internal audit function report to the controller or
chief financial officer. In these situations, the manager of the accounting function
has the additional burden of selecting auditing targets, planning for audit teams to
review them, managing the teams, and acting on their findings. For a larger
organization, this management work can be a considerable additional burden, for
there may be many auditors.

Although it is not possible to completely eliminate all management of the
internal audit function, a controller or chief financial officer can outsource the
function, which removes selected management tasks. For example, giving all
internal audit work to an outside supplier keeps a manager from having to plan
each audit or review the teams as they conduct their work. It still requires a
manager to select audit targets and act on the results of the audits, but at least some
activities have been eliminated. Using an outside auditor carries with it the
additional advantage of reduced travel time to outlying company locations, since
an audit firm with many locations can assign local staff to each company facility.
Further, outside auditors are not paid if they are not working on company-specific
projects, nor does a company have to pay for their ongoing training. These
advantages have pushed a number of companies into the arms of outside auditors.


16-14 Schedule Internal Audits Based on Risk 361

However, there are problems with this best practice that have raised some ire
in the ranks of internal auditors. One issue is that many companies use their internal
auditing departments to groom new managers for senior-level positions. This is an
excellent approach, for not only does it give auditors a wide-ranging view of
company operations but also it allows the managers of functions being audited to
see them and to provide feedback to the human resources department regarding the
wisdom of promoting them to more senior positions. Another problem is that
outside auditors will sometimes assign junior staff personnel to internal audits,
which allows them to charge less per hour. However, these junior personnel
frequently have less experience than the internal auditors, and no experience with
specific details of company operations, making them doubly inefficient. Conse-
quently, carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of this approach before
handing over the internal audit department to a supplier.

16-13 Schedule Some Internal Audits on a Just-in-Time Basis

A very common management practice is to create a schedule of all internal audits to
be performed for the upcoming year. This allows the audit manager to arrange for
meetings with local managers well in advance, as well as to determine the logistics of
shifting auditors around the world to various company locations. It is also acommon
measurement tool, whereby the audit manager commits to completing a certain
number of audits; subsequently, finishing all work listed on the annual schedule is
used as the baseline measure of success. Unfortunately, blocking out the entire audit
staff’s time for a year in advance also leaves no room for audits that are requested on
short notice, which typically occurs when a control emergency arises. Addressing
these needs calls for a substantial reshuffling of the audit schedule.

A fine alternative is to schedule only a portion of the internal audit team’s time,
perhaps two-thirds, leaving the remaining time slots open. By doing so, any short-
term work requests can be dealt with promptly. Not only does this give company
managers the impression that the internal audit department is more responsive to
their needs, but it also eliminates the need for sudden schedule changes. The only
problem with this approach is that one can no longer determine the success of the
internal audit department based on its ability to complete a planned set of audits.

16-14 Schedule Internal Audits Based on Risk

The scheduling of various areas within a company for internal audits is usually an
arcane process, involving pressure from the audit committee to have a few “pet”

areas investigated; during the process some department managers demand reviews
of other areas, while others put forth considerable effort to avoid them, on the
grounds that they take up too much staff time. The internal audit manager is caught
in the midst of this maelstrom, trying to please everyone while still scheduling
audits for those areas in which he or she has a feeling that some problems may lurk.
A simple way to revise this scheduling process is to base all audits on the concept
of risk to the company.

To schedule based on risk, a company must devise a ranking for risk levels,
with number one being any potential control problem that could place the company
in grave financial danger, while lower levels of risk can be assigned a lesser
category. Then the internal audit manager assigns a risk ranking to each requested
audit, while also conducting a review of other control areas to see if there are other
areas of risk that are not currently being addressed. The upshot of this process is a
clear ranking of audit reviews that is highly defensible and that will focus the bulk
of company audit attention on those few key control processes that are at the most
risk of causing financial trouble.

The main issue to be aware of is that the internal audit committee should
formally approve of this scheduling process, so the internal audit manager can use
that committee’s support when telling other company managers that their requested
audits will not occur quite so quickly as they would like.

16-15 Use Workflow Software for Internal Audits

Larger companies with many internal auditors face the following challenge: They
have a difficult time controlling the activities of their auditors, rarely have a good
knowledge of prior audits already completed, require extra travel time to return to
company locations to clear hanging audit issues, and cannot readily see if the same
auditing problems are cropping up in multiple parts of the company. These
problems result in significant inefficiencies in work efforts.

You can resolve these problems by installing workflow software that has been
tailored to the particular needs of the internal auditing environment. For example,
workflow software contains forms and templates that are commonly used in most
audits, allowing the staff to save time that would otherwise be spent creating work
papers from scratch. In addition, information entered directly into the workflow
database through these online forms can be reviewed from a central location by
audit managers, thereby reducing the amount of time spent traveling to remote
company locations. Further, this information is then available to all auditors,
anywhere in the company, for immediate review.

If audit documents must be approved by multiple people, the software can
send an electronic version of the documents to each person in turn, and wait for
each one’s approval before being sent to the next person in the approval process.


16-16 Implement Continuous Controls Monitoring 363

It can also inform each approver of the date by which approval must be
obtained. The system can also keep track of when each document was made,
by whom, and when it was subsequently reviewed and approved. Reviewers can
also create review notes that are attached to the electronic audit documents and
that must be cleared by the audit team before the work papers will receive final
approval.

Workflow software can also maintain a database of previous audit work at
each company location, as well as the results of that work, so that subsequent audit
teams can review the prior work to see what efforts can be avoided in the future. Of
particular importance is a risk assessment by prior audit teams, so one can
immediately see where the bulk of new audit work should be directed. The
system can also be used to summarize audit issues across all business units, thereby
giving audit managers visibility into broader risk issues that must be addressed on a
continuing basis.

The initial cost of audit workflow software exceeds $100,000 (depending on
the configuration and number of seat licenses) and requires significant custom-
ization and installation time.

16-16 Implement Continuous Controls Monitoring

Controls can be a difficult imposition on many companies. They can require
extra data entry or the production of reports, which managers then review for
anomalies. Also, larger firms use internal auditors to conduct laborious reviews
of systems on a rotating basis. Both approaches are expensive and tend to make
processes less efficient. What if there were a way to automate the monitoring of
controls? There is.

Several companies have created continuous controls monitoring (CCM)
solutions. These systems draw data from a number of databases and then review
100 percent of all transactions, looking for data anomalies, errors, segregation of
duty issues, and possible control breaches. The systems contain tables of standard
control objectives, including the areas of authorization, accuracy, completeness,
validity, and segregation of duties, and contain tests to ensure that each objective is
met at each step of the various transaction process flows. These tests are available
for all major transactional areas, including payroll, the order-to-cash cycle, the
purchase-to-payment cycle, inventory management, travel expenses, and procure-
ment cards.

For example, a CCM will have separate tests for the proper authorization,
data-entry accuracy, transaction completeness, and validity of all cash receipts. As
another example, a CCM will verify that sales orders are completely filled out
before being submitted for fulfillment, invoices are issued within a specified time
period from order shipment, and write-offs are properly authorized.


364 Internal Auditing Best Practices

The CCM then notifies designated employees of any problems found with
browser-based reports, resulting in a highly targeted manual investigation to locate
each root problem. A CCM system also makes it easier to comply with the
provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

16-17 Fill Internal Audit Positions from Operations
on a Rotating Basis

The problem with auditing the operations of a large company is the extremely high
level of procedural complexity that must be understood in order to locate control
problems. When internal auditors are hired from outside the company, they face a
steep learning curve with these systems, possibly requiring well over a year to
become conversant with even a limited subset of a company’s systems. This not
only represents an inadequate use of expensive staff but also creates the risk that
control breaches may go unobserved until new internal audit staff complete their
understanding of corporate systems.

A possible solution is to fill internal audit positions from the operations
divisions on a rotating basis. This approach ensures a high level of operational
knowledge by auditors so that a much higher level of audit effectiveness can be
achieved at once. By rotating in new staff on a regular basis, the internal audit
manager is assured of having auditors with the most current knowledge of
company systems. Conversely, these employees will require training in internal
audit procedures, though it typically requires less time to achieve a reasonable level
of competency. There is also a risk that auditors rotated in from the ranks of the
operations staff will be less inclined to bring up control problems involving the
divisions from which they were hired. This risk can be reduced by creating a
cooperative audit environment with the managers of audited divisions, as well as
by pairing these audit staff with senior-level internal auditors who have fewer
divisional affiliations.

On the whole, bringing in even a few auditors from the operations side of the
business can inject a considerable level of added expertise into the internal audit
department.

Cost: FF Installation time:

16-18 Add Specialists to Audit Teams

A typical internal auditor has received training in a standard set of auditing
functions that apply to the activities encountered in the majority of audits.
However, specialized processes will be scheduled for audits from time to time


16-19 Assign Auditor to Be Relationship Manager with Business Unit 365

for which the internal audit staff has received no training. This may arise when a
business process has been specially modified or enhanced at one or a few company
locations, and the internal audit staff is unfamiliar with the modifications or their
impact on controls. These audits can be difficult, since the internal auditor must
spend time learning the new or revised process and determining any resulting
changes to the control environment.

A better approach is to invite specialists to an audit to deal with these
processes. A good person to invite is someone who has personally been involved
in the implementation of a particular system at a different location, and who,
therefore, is an expert on the process under review. This person is particularly
useful if the intent of the audit is to recommend the implementation of the system
in which the person is an expert, since he or she can offer valuable implemen-
tation tips to the local management team in regard to installing the system. Once
the audit is over, the audit team disbands, with the specialist returning to his or
her business unit. This person may be used again at a later date, or the internal
auditors can learn enough from the specialist to take that person’s place on
subsequent audits.

16-19 Assign an Auditor to Be a Relationship Manager
with Each Business Unit

The internal audit department rarely has visibility into the work of individual
business units. The unit managers typically revise their own systems on an
ongoing basis in order to streamline processes, and never think to check with the
internal audit staff for advice on these changes. Also, the internal audit
department has access to a wealth of information about how other business
units structure their processes, but rarely has an opportunity to relay this
information to business unit managers, resulting in many lost opportunities
for improvements.

Both of these issues can be avoided by assigning a senior internal auditor to
the role of relationship manager with the manager of each business unit. This
person is responsible for communicating regularly with an assigned manager, not
only to impart improvement information but also to find out which activities at the
business unit should involve the participation of the internal audit staff. For
example, if a business unit is considering programming a new accounts payable
system, the relationship manager can ask that an auditor be assigned to the design
team to ensure that appropriate controls are built into the system. This approach is
also an excellent means for improving relations between the internal audit
department and the rest of the company.

16-20 Assign Internal Auditors to System Development Teams

When a company’s systems development staff creates a new business system,
either the accounting staff or the external auditors find control problems after the
fact that require either significant programming changes or major modifications
to other systems that must now be relied upon as secondary controls that offset
the problems found. Some of these problems are so severe that entire systems
must be scrapped or entirely reworked. The worst case is when a control
weakness is spotted by someone who exploits it to fraudulently part a company
from its assets.

Many of these control problems can be eliminated by making an internal audit
person an integral part of a systems design team. By regularly reviewing the
conceptual and detailed designs of new systems, internal auditors can spot potential
control problems before any significant programming time has been spent on them.
This not only achieves a higher level of control in new systems but also avoids the
time that would otherwise be spent on correctional changes to systems at a later date.
Proper use of this best practice requires the involvement of auditors with significant
systems design and controls knowledge.

Cost: SF Installation time:

16-21 Create an Auditor Skills Matrix

Not all auditors are created equal. Some have a considerable degree of training in
specific types of computer systems, others have great operational experience,
while still others come from the more classical “school” of external audit firms;
furthermore, some have garnered experience with particular types of business
units or processes over the years. Unfortunately, these differing skill bases are
sometimes ignored when assigning auditors to specific audits, resulting in
mismatches of skills and required work. This in turn can result in incomplete
audits or ones whose results are not sufficiently specific, detailed, or helpful to
the recipient.

A solution is the creation of an auditor skills matrix. In its simplest form,
this is just a collection of auditor resumes that is regularly updated after each
audit. However, such a collection is not easily searched for specific skill types,
and so is only useful when there are very few internal auditors on staff. A much
better approach is to itemize these skills in a database that is easily searched
based on key words. This allows an audit manager to punch the key requirements
of an upcoming audit into the database and instantly receive back a list of
those auditors most qualified to complete the work. The key issue with a
skills database is that it requires constant updating, since auditor skills are constantly
improving through training and new audits. Consequently, someone must be
assigned the task of updating skills information on a regular basis, preferably after


16-22 Use Excel for Continuous Auditing 367

the completion of each audit and after auditors have completed scheduled tasks. If
this updating chore is assigned to the auditors themselves, then their annual reviews
should include a discussion of the updates they have loaded into the database, thereby
highlighting the importance of this task.

Cost: SF Installation time:

16-22 Use Excel for Continuous Auditing

Instead of waiting for an infrequent internal audit to investigate a variety of risk
areas, consider a regularly scheduled investigation using Excel and data down-
loaded from the accounting system. Excel downloads are a staple of most
accounting software, usually resulting in either preformatted spreadsheets or
comma-delimited text that can be easily converted into a spreadsheet. Once in
spreadsheet format, consider making the following tests:

¢ Transactions during odd hours. For all types of transactions, sort the
spreadsheet based on time and date to see if anyone is accessing the system
outside of regular working hours, and investigate any transactions made
during those times.

¢ Same data-entry person for the same supplier. For payables transactions,
sort the spreadsheet by supplier name and then by the user ID of the person
entering transactions. If the same person always enters payables for the same
supplier, this could be a shell company owned by the data-entry person.

¢ Subthreshold transactions. For payables transactions, sort in declining order
by invoice totals, and investigate payments for which dollar amounts are just
below the corporate approval threshold. Chances are good that some involve
split payments to avoid detailed analysis by an authorized approver.

¢ Late customer orders with no purchase order. For billing transactions, first
sort on overdue customer invoices, then sort the resulting subset on billings
without customer purchase order numbers, and then sort this even smaller
subset on orders exceeding the credit approval threshold. The result may be a
small number of orders that were improperly routed around the credit
department.

These are only a few suggestions for possible tests. A more company-specific
approach is to periodically analyze potential risks in relation to the existing control
structure and see which high-risk items are most suitable for investigation with
spreadsheet analysis.

16.23 Support the Outside Auditors

The fees charged by a company’s outside auditors to review or audit its financial
statements vary somewhere between “reasonable” for a local CPA firm and
“extortionate” for a large international accounting firm. In the latter case, it makes
considerable sense from a cost-reduction perspective to assign a large part of the
internal audit staff to a support role, where they assist the outside auditors to the
greatest extent possible.

This support role should be extremely efficient, since the internal audit staff
has a vastly better knowledge of where information is located in the company, and
can access it much faster than the outside auditors. They can also explain the
company’s control systems to the outside auditors.

The corporate controller and internal audit manager should keep close track of
the time spent in support of the outside auditors, since this information can be used
to effect a fee reduction, especially if the outside auditors are demonstrably relying
on the information provided by the internal audit staff.

Summary

The primary intent of this chapter was to recommend a shift in focus for the internal
audit department, from a detailed reviewer of business processes to an enabler of
process improvements. This change requires a significant attitudinal adjustment by
the internal audit manager, who may be wedded to the traditional concept of
independent control reviews that tend to create adversarial or, at least, cool
relations with company managers. If the recommendations made here seem to
be too much of a stretch for the internal audit manager, then try just one best
practice—the business unit survey—which may reveal that the rest of the company
gives a lower value to the internal audit department than its manager supposes, and
which may then spark further changes.

Inventory Best Practices

This chapter describes a variety of best practices that are focused on improving the
accuracy of the existing inventory, improving inventory transactions, and reducing
a company’s investment in inventory. Though these improvements most directly
assist other departments, such as the production, warehouse, and purchasing
employees, the accounting staff is deeply interested as well. The reason is that
the accuracy of the financial statements is largely driven by the accuracy of the
inventory—if it is off by even a few percentage points, the variance flows through
the cost of goods sold, resulting in a considerable amount of inaccuracy in reported
profits. Even better, if the inventory investment can be reduced, the risk of
incorrectly counting or valuing the inventory is also reduced.

The best practices shown in this chapter are different from those listed
elsewhere in this book, in that the controller must obtain the approval and active
participation of the warehouse, purchasing, and engineering managers for most of
them. Without their help, such best practices as improving the bills of material,
moving inventory to floor stock, and segregating customer-owned inventory will
not be accomplished.

The remainder of this chapter consists of a review of implementation issues for
inventory best practices, followed by a detailed discussion of each one.

Implementation Issues for Inventory Best Practices

This section describes the levels of implementation difficulty for each of the best
practices detailed in this chapter. Each one is noted in Exhibit 17.1, alongside a
listing of the relative level of implementation cost and duration. Most of these
best practices are not simple ones to install because they involve one or more
other departments, usually warehousing, purchasing, and engineering. Whenever
another manager is brought into the implementation process, the chances of
success drop rapidly, since this additional person must be convinced of the efficacy
of the change.

A few of the best practices noted here rarely succeed at all, though world-class
companies have installed them—these are the elimination of the warehouse and the
receiving function, which can be accomplished only through a time-consuming
process of inventory elimination and supplier qualification. However, for those

companies that are well along in accomplishing these tasks, the best practices
should be considered, given the resulting reduction in costs and accounting
transactions.

Most of the other best practices are relatively inexpensive to install, since they
generally involve changes to procedures, which have no attendant expense. A few
best practices require the installation of fencing or different bin systems, but even
these expenses are not considerable, unless the warehouse in question is a very
large one. The remainder of this chapter separately discusses each of the best
practices shown in Exhibit 17.1.

17-1 Audit Bills of Material

Some companies use back-flushing as the means of recording changes to
inventory. Under this methodology, inventory is taken from the warehouse
without any associated picking transactions put into the computer. Then, when
production is completed, the total amount of production by item is entered into
the computer, and the software automatically removes the associated inventory
amounts from the warehouse records, using bills of material as the basis for
doing so. Though this is a simple method for keeping warehouse paperwork to a
minimum, an incorrect bill of material will quickly alter the on-hand inventory
balances to such an extent that inventory accuracy will plummet. In addition, the
accounting department uses the bills of material to determine the cost of any
finished goods; an inaccurate bill will also impact the accuracy of this costing.
Thus, the accuracy of a company’s bills of material impact not only the records
for inventory quantities but also their cost.

The solution that keeps bill of material errors to a minimum is an ongoing
audit of them. This practice keeps inventory quantities from becoming too
inaccurate in a back-flushing environment, while making the costing of finished


17-2 Conduct a Configuration Audit 373

goods more precise. To do so, a person who is knowledgeable about the contents of
bills of material must be assigned to a regular review of them. Any problems must
be corrected at once. To be the most effective, it is best to concentrate the efforts of
the reviewer on those bills that are used the most or that are expected to be included
in upcoming production runs. By focusing on those bills receiving the most usage,
a company can be sure of maintaining a high degree of bill accuracy for the bulk of
its products.

The only implementation difficulty is that it requires the cooperation of the
engineering manager, who must assign a staff person to the reviewing process.
This assistance is critical, since engineers are the ones with the best knowledge of
bills of material.

17-2 Conducta Configuration Audit

Companies can run into warranty trouble when their engineering departments
design a product correction, but the engineering change never makes its way into
the production process. This is also a problem when the engineering changes
make it partway through the company to the purchasing department, which
orders new components to match the change, but not to the production floor,
which assembles products based on the old configuration. This problem leaves
the warehouse manager caught in the middle, storing inventory for the new
configuration that is not used by the production staff, while running out of
components for the old configuration that is still being assembled. The problem
is exacerbated if bills of material are not updated for the changes so that pick lists
are incorrect. From the controller’s perspective, the company will experience an
increase in its inventory investment, as well as a probable jump in its obsolete
inventory levels.

The solution is an ongoing configuration audit, preferably right after an
engineering change or a new product is released. Under a configuration audit,
an engineer or internal auditor familiar with the product pulls a completed
product from the manufacturing line, disassembles it, and compares it to all
engineering documents related to the product, including all authorized updates.
If the product accurately reflects the current design, then no further action is
required. If not, you must verify the accuracy of the bill of material, pick lists
presumably derived from the bill, outstanding purchase orders, and production
work instructions.

This is a necessary best practice that reveals any weaknesses in the procedures
used by a company to roll out new products and manufacture modifications to
existing ones.

374 Inventory Best Practices

17-3 Modify the Bills of Material Based on Actual Scrap Levels

The typical company relies heavily on its bills of material to determine the cost of
its products. They can be used not only as a reference tool to quickly look up a cost
but also as the primary means of calculating the remaining on-hand inventory
balance if back-flushing is used. Under the back-flushing concept, a company
simply enters the amount of its production for the day, and the computer will
automatically clear this inventory from stock, based on the amount of materials that
should have been used, as noted in the bills of material. Though this approach is
remarkably easy to use, given the reduced volume of paperwork, it can quickly
lead to very inaccurate inventory balances if the underlying bills of material are
incorrect. This is a particularly difficult problem if the true scrap level is not
reflected in the bills of material. If this is the case, the amount of materials listed in
each bill will be too small, resulting in an inadequate amount’s being back-flushed
out of inventory, which leaves inventory balances too high.

The solution is to ensure that the correct scrap levels are included in each bill
of material. By doing so, the amount of material back-flushed out of the inventory
will be much more accurate, resulting in a more accurate inventory, cost of goods
sold, and fewer (if any) material stock-outs to interfere with production.

To add accurate scrap rates to the bills of material, there must be a scrap
reporting system already in place that notes the precise quantities of scrap that
occur whenever a product is produced. With this information in hand, you can
easily update scrap rates with a great deal of precision. Also, access to the
information in the bills of material must be severely restricted to ensure that
no one but an authorized user is allowed to change the scrap rates in bills; without
this security point, there is no way to ensure that the most accurate scrap rates are
indeed in the computer system. In addition, there must be constant attention to the
scrap rates, for they will change over time as production practices and machinery
change. Without this continual review process, the existing scrap rates in the bills
of material will gradually depart from actual rates. Finally, there should be a
provision in the computer system for automatically changing large blocks of scrap
rates in many bills of material; given the time needed to alter individual scrap line
items in all existing bills, this is an extremely helpful labor-saving device to have
on hand. If all of these issues are addressed, the accuracy of the bills of material
should rise markedly, along with the accuracy of the inventory and cost of goods
sold.

17-4 Review Inventory Returned to the Warehouse

Most organizations that produce any sort of tangible product will be familiar with
this scenario: the warehouse staff uses a computer-generated picking list to pick a


17-5 Modify the Bills of Material for Temporary Substitutions 375

number of items from the shelf for use in an upcoming manufacturing order,
delivers these items to the production facility, and then finds after the job is
completed that a number of items are returned to the warehouse, even though the
pick list it used was intended to completely use up all items picked. Any returns of
this type indicate that the bills of material used to compile the pick lists are
incorrect. When this happens, the bills of material are listing too high a quantity of
materials; if these bills are also used to calculate the amount of items to be
purchased, an excessive number of purchases are being made. From an accounting
perspective, an inaccurate bill of material leads to inaccurate product costs, which
results in an inaccurate finished goods valuation.

The solution is to create a procedure for closely examining the parts returned
to the warehouse, in order to determine exactly which line items in the bills of
material are inaccurate. This may require the assistance of the engineer who is
responsible for each bill of material, since this person has the most knowledge of
what is contained in each product. By making changes to the bills, you can improve
the accuracy of purchases, eliminate the labor of the warehouse staff in logging
parts back into the warehouse, and be assured of accurate finished goods costs.

The only problem with this procedure is that it requires the active cooperation
of the warehouse manager, who will most likely try to avoid the hassle of
investigating product returns and just put items back on the shelf with no further
investigation. However, explaining that a proper amount of up-front investigation
will lead to a smaller number of part returns in the future may sway this person to
be of more assistance.

This best practice can also be used in reverse so that any additional parts
issuances to the production floor are investigated. In this situation, the quantities
listed on the bills of material are too low, resulting in parts shortages that will
probably lead to incomplete production runs, on the grounds that the production
staff runs out of parts before completing the scheduled quantity of products.

17-5 Modify the Bills of Material for Temporary Substitutions

When a company has some excess items in stock that could be used in an existing
product, the materials management staff is sometimes unwilling to use the part,
because they perceive it to be so difficult to modify the bills of material and all
related parts ordering systems. The result is excess parts sitting in the warehouse,
representing an excessive level of inventory investment.

The solution is to create a simplified system for modifying the bills of material
for temporary substitutions. To do so, there must first be a written authorization
from the engineering department, specifying exactly which component is to be
removed from an existing bill of material, which one is to replace it, the quantities
involved, and the dates during which this change will be in effect. The materials


376 Inventory Best Practices

management staff needs to be involved in the date range, since they must schedule
a production run that will use up the replacement part. Finally, the person in charge
of bill of material changes must make the swap in the bill of material file. Of
particular concern here is that the person also reset a reorder flag for the
replacement part in the item master file so that the material requirements system
does not automatically reorder the part just because it now appears to be an
active part.

These steps can be reduced if the bill of material database already contains a
feature allowing for the short-term swapping of parts. If this is available, the
swapping procedure will be somewhat shorter.

Given the number of steps involved, temporary substitutions are not worth-
while when the swapping procedure being contemplated is for components having
a small total value, since the work required to do so will offset the savings from
eliminating inventory. The cost accounting staff should develop a standard
transaction cost for temporary substitutions and use this as the cutoff point below
which inventory will not be substituted.

17-6 Use Bills of Material to Find Inventory Made Obsolete
by Product Withdrawals

When the marketing department investigates the possibility of withdrawing a
product from sale, it frequently does so without determining how much inventory
of both the finished product and its component parts remains on hand. At most,
the marketing staff concerns itself only with clearing out excess finished goods,
since this can be readily identified. Those unique parts used only in the
manufacture of the withdrawn product will then be left to gather dust in the
warehouse, and will eventually be sold off as scrap only after a substantial
amount of time has passed.

A better approach is to have the engineering department use the product’s bill
of material to create a list of component parts unique to that product. This typically
requires a custom program and a fair amount of processing time, since the bill’s
components must be compared to the contents of all other active bills, including
their subassemblies, to determine which parts are not used in the manufacture of
any other products. Once determined, this information can be used to calculate the
product withdrawal date, since it may make sense to continue manufacturing
the product a bit longer in order to use up expensive stock. Engineers can also use
the list to incorporate excess parts into the design of new products, if this makes
sense. Worst case, the list at least brings excess parts to the attention of the
purchasing department, which can work on returning them to suppliers for credit or
disposing of the parts in some other manner, thereby creating shelf space in the
warehouse as soon as possible for more heavily used items.


17-8 Reject Unplanned Receipts 377

Many materials planning software packages include a “where-used” report,
which fulfills this need to some extent. The report lists every product whose bill of
material calls for the use of a specific component. The report may require a fair
amount of investigation before you can determine which items have truly been
made obsolete, since you must compare each item listed on a retired product’s bill
of material to the items shown on the where-used report to verify which items are
not being used elsewhere and can therefore be designated as obsolete.

17-7 Compare Open Purchase Orders to Current Requirements

Between the time when a company issues a purchase order to a supplier and the
date when the ordered items arrive, several problems may arise that render the
original purchase order inaccurate. First, customer orders to the company may
change, resulting in a modified production schedule that no longer requires certain
parts from suppliers. Second, ongoing changes in the design of company products
may render some parts obsolete. Third, adjustments to recorded inventory balances
through the cycle-counting process may result in a need for fewer or more parts
than are currently on order. For these reasons, by the date of their arrival, the
amount of goods delivered by suppliers may vary significantly from a company’s
needs.

To alleviate this problem, design a report that should be run through the
corporate materials planning system on a daily basis, comparing the amount of
outstanding balances on open purchase orders to the company’s needs, as listed in
the material requirements portion of the company computer systems. By reviewing
this report, the purchasing staff can modify the amounts listed on open purchase
orders, thereby resulting in an ongoing reduction in the amount of inventory kept
on hand. This report is a standard part of any material requirements planning
system, but must be created as a custom report for those companies without such a
system.

17-8 Reject Unplanned Receipts

The ideal receiving scenario is when the supplier sends a message to a company’s
receiving department, telling it that a shipment is on its way, what is in the
shipment, and when it is expected to arrive. By doing so, the receiving staff is
prepared in advance to properly log in the received item and disposition it in an
orderly manner. Reality is a tad less efficient. Unplanned and unidentified receipts
can arrive at any time, requiring the receiving staff to set them aside for eventual


378 Inventory Best Practices

identification, log-in, and disposition, which can take days and interfere with the
orderly running of the receiving area. Delays can be especially long when the
receiving staff has no idea who ordered something and must conduct a Sherlock
Holmes-style investigation throughout the company to identify an item’s owner.
Due to this delay, suppliers are more likely to encounter payment delays, while the
production staff finds that necessary items are hidden amid the stack of unidentified
items at the receiving dock, thereby interfering with the manufacturing process.
Further, fraudulent deliveries can be received (and then billed to the company)
without the company having any idea of the problem for some time, since there is
no policy to reject unplanned receipts.

These problems can be overcome through the rigorous rejection of all
unplanned receipts. By doing so, the receiving staff has no backlog of receipt
identifications to labor through, nor is it subjected to unexpected deliveries that it
may have no available labor to handle.

Though this best practice sounds simple, it is extremely difficult to implement.
Success in this area requires training the entire organization to understand that only
authorized purchases coming through the purchasing department will be allowed at
the receiving dock. This means that a purchase order number must be assigned to
every single item shipped to the company; if there is no number in evidence,
the item is rejected. This is a hard lesson to learn when a rush order arrives and
is rejected, potentially causing significant short-term problems in a variety of
departments. Nonetheless, only a hard commitment to the rejection of unplanned
receipts, coupled with strong support by senior management, can achieve this best
practice. It is also easy for a company to suffer a collective relapse in this area, so
management must support it consistently over the long term.

17-9 Obtain Advance Shipping Notices for Inbound Deliveries

There is a great deal of in-house activity surrounding the receipt of goods, including
possible cross-docking of received items to an outbound truck, the availability of
dock doors, clearing of staging space, and arranging for prompt quality assurance
reviews. This is especially difficult if the warehouse manager is not aware of
the exact arrival time of inbound deliveries, resulting in a bedlam of unplanned
activity when a delivery arrives. Given the difficulty of planning operations against
uncertain delivery arrival times, there is an inherent level of inefficiency in the
receiving operation.

A good approach for introducing more planning into the receiving function is
to arrange for the receipt of advance shipping notices from the inbound freight
carrier. This best practice is easiest to implement with the larger third-party freight
haulers, several of whom have created onboard tracking systems that monitor their
progress and make this information available to customers, either by telephone,


17-10 Eliminate the Receiving Function 379

proprietary network, or the Internet (mostly the last approach). If freight is not
arriving by such a carrier, you can also arrange to have the supplier contact the
company by any number of communication media to notify it of the approximate
arrival time of a load, as well as the contents of that load. It is also possible to obtain
system-to-system transparency of this information through the use of automated
electronic data interchange (EDI) transactions, but this approach is moderately
expensive to set up, and so is normally used only between frequent trading
partners.

The downside to this best practice is the difficulty of having minor suppliers
adhere to it. They tend to arrive at unscheduled times, clogging dock doors needed
for scheduled arrivals. You can mitigate this problem by leaving a small number of
outlying dock doors available for the use of these suppliers, or by gradually
eliminating them with the cooperation of the purchasing department. Another issue
is the use of third-party freight carriers by suppliers that do not offer advance
shipping notice services; the purchasing department should demand the use of
specific freight carriers when it places a purchase order, thereby controlling
this problem.

17-10 Eliminate the Receiving Function

The receiving function is responsible for entering receipts into the computer
system, and occasionally does not do a good job in this capacity. For example, the
late or inaccurate data entry of receiving information can lead to inaccurate
financial statements, as well as inaccurate information for the production planning
and purchasing staffs to procure and assemble materials for the production
department to use.

This is an extremely difficult best practice to implement. The concept that only
a relatively small number of companies have fully implemented is to fully qualify
suppliers in terms of their ability to ship goods of high quality, precisely on time,
and to do so directly to the production process. This requires a great deal of
advance work by the purchasing staff to find suppliers that are willing to do this, as
well as supplier inspections by company engineers to ensure that supplier quality
standards match or exceed those of the company. Only after this work has been
done can a company convert to the direct delivery of goods to the production
department, bypassing the receiving area.

A final problem to overcome is how to account for receipts if there is no
receiving staff. The answer is to assume that parts were received if the products in
which they are used as components were built. Accordingly, production records
are exploded into their component parts in the computer to determine whose parts
were used, and to then pay those suppliers based on these usage records. Subsidiary
problems to resolve before this payment system will work are to centralize


380 Inventory Best Practices

component sourcing with one supplier per part and to eliminate all scrap from the
production process. Supplier centralization is necessary because the computer
system will not know which supplier to pay once it backs into the number of parts
used. Similarly, there can be no scrap in the production process, or else suppliers
will not be paid for the full number of parts delivered, since these parts were not
included in finished products; the only alternative that will work here is to set up a
scrap reporting system, from which suppliers can also be paid.

Clearly, there are a large number of major issues to overcome before the
receiving department can be eliminated. Though this does result in fewer transac-
tion errors for the accounting department to worry about, this improvement is
dwarfed by the changes needed to bring it about. Accordingly, this best practice
should be attempted only if there are a number of other reasons for eliminating the
receiving function.

17-11 Use Standard Containers to Move, Store,
and Count Inventory

In many warehouse settings, the ideal container is the pallet. It can arrive at the
receiving dock, be efficiently moved to storage with a forklift, and eventually be
carried from there to the shop floor. It is also simple to count inventory when stored
in pallet sizes, while many racking systems are preconfigured to hold pallets, which
readily fills a warehouse’s cubic volume. This excellent level of efficiency stops
when pallets are broken down into cases or single items. The putaway and picking
staffs must now be much more careful in recording quantities moved, while the
effort required to count stock becomes much higher.

A very good best practice is the use of standard containers for these partial-
pallet situations. By using a standard container size, you can more efficiently move
items that might otherwise require individual piece-by-piece movement. Also,
depending on how a container is set up, an inventory counter can glance at a
container to determine the total quantity it contains.

Different containers will probably be needed for different types of stock,
depending on the cubic volume of each one. A common approach is to fill several
standard containers with the same item and pick only from the one in front. By
doing so, an inventory counter can easily determine the quantities in all other filled
containers and manually count only the one partial container in front. A variation
on the standard container is a simple sealed plastic bag, which can be filled with a
set quantity, labeled, and stapled shut. An inventory counter can determine its
quantity immediately, while the usage signal (a ripped-open bag) indicates that a
more careful count is in order.

The use of standard containers can be taken too far. In many situations, it is
still easier to move, store, and count a partially used pallet-load without going to

the sometimes-considerable effort of shifting everything into standard containers.
Its best application is for small parts that would otherwise be difficult to handle and
count.

Cost: Sy Installation time:

17-12 Use Different Storage Systems Based
on Cubic Transactional Volume

It can be difficult to slot items into various inventory locations around a warehouse
just based on their cubic volume, since this single criterion does not reflect the
amount of moves to which each one will be subject. As a result, the warehouse staff
may find largely unused items slotted near the shortest access paths in the
warehouse, while high-use items are parked in the rear, causing long travel times.
This is a particular problem for small parts, since there are a variety of both low- and
high-efficiency storage modes available for them.

A good solution is to assign storage locations based on both an item’s cubic
volume and number of transactions. As a result, some high-use pallets will be
stored near a major picking area, while other less used pallets will be kept in
random storage along a back wall. Similarly, low-volume small parts may be
stored in bins or storage drawers, while high-volume small parts will be stored in
carousels from which picking can be done much more quickly. This approach
can even extend to the height at which small parts are stored in fixed bins, with
high-volume items stored at waist level for easy picking.

Cost: Sy Installation time:

17-13 Organize the Warehouse by Storage Zones

If a warehouse evolves over time without significant up-front planning, there is a
strong tendency for items to be stored without any thought given to their storage
requirements—for example, bulky, small, perishable, refrigerated, or flammable
items. The result is a hodgepodge environment in which it is difficult to put away or
pick inventory, and where obsolescence rates are higher than would normally be
the case.

The solution is to organize the warehouse by storage zones. This means
identifying all items in advance with special handling and storage requirements,
then building the warehouse storage configuration around those requirements.
Further, you must include in this calculation the cubic volume of each type of
inventory likely to be kept on hand, so the appropriate storage volumes are
assigned. As an example, a warehouse can include a bin-shelving and modular
storage drawer area in which to store the smallest items, a double-deep racking


382 Inventory Best Practices

system to store large quantities of pallet loads, and a carousel area for the picking of
small-volume, high-usage items.

There is no downside to this best practice. The proper organization of a
warehouse into storage zones is absolutely fundamental to the efficient storage and
movement of inventory. It is best to engage in this best practice during the planning
stages of a new warehouse, though it can be done later, despite the obvious
inefficiency of reconfiguring an existing layout.

Cost: Sy Installation time:

17-14 Optimize Inventory Storage through Periodic
Location Changes

Though inventory may initially be organized to reduce the travel time of order
pickers, this may change over time as different items become more or less popular.
This is a particular problem for items whose sales change dramatically on a
seasonal basis, or in proportion to their presence in certain catalogs or short-term
sales promotions. In such cases, the picking staff may suddenly find itself traveling
much farther to pick items than was the case just the day before.

A labor-intensive solution is to periodically review and revise inventory
storage locations based on estimated demand patterns. This is not difficult for
seasonal goods, since it is evident which items will soon experience changed levels
of demand. Likewise, the imminent release of a new catalog should trigger
inventory locational changes based on the contents of the catalog. On a very
short-term basis, automated storage and retrieval systems can be assigned the task
of completely shifting inventory overnight, so it is properly reconfigured to
minimize its travel time the next day.

An advanced warehouse management system can perform this inventory
review chore periodically, and can also recommend new inventory locations
whenever the warehouse itself is reconfigured with new or revised storage
locations. However, warehouse management systems offering this feature are
extremely expensive. An alternative is to periodically bring in a consultant who
can manually perform the same task; this approach can actually result in a better
configuration than what is recommended by a computer since a consultant may use
a larger array of configuration criteria than are built into a computer system.

17-15 Maximize Vertical Storage Space

Many warehouses have considerable vertical space available, frequently in the
range of 30 feet, before encountering such obstructions as sprinkler systems and


17-16 Use Narrow Aisles in Manual Putaway and Picking Zones 383

support beams. Nonetheless, a common mind-set is to extend storage only a
modest distance above a person’s height, typically in the range of a dozen feet or
so. When there is not enough space left in the warehouse using such storage
systems, a company will waste money adding storage space in other locations.

An alternative is to investigate the possibility of increasing a warehouse’s
vertical storage capacity in one of two ways. First, see if it is possible to stack
multiple layers of the same stock-keeping unit (SKU) on top of one another
(known as “stackability”). This may require the insertion of a slip sheet made of
plastic, wood, or cardboard between SKU layers to provide some rigidity to a
stack. You should carefully test the stackability of each SKU on a controlled basis
to determine the maximum number of layers that can be stacked while still
providing maximum security to the warehouse staff. If this approach works, be
sure to include the stackability factor for each SKU in the time master file, in case
management wants to install a computerized system for maximizing the storage of
SKUs.

A second alternative is to extend racks skyward. This can be expensive but
may also be significantly cheaper than the alternative of renting additional space
elsewhere. However, existing racks may be too flimsy to stand the strain of
additional racks, so you may have to consider the cost not of just a few incremental
racks, but of the entire warehouse rack system. Also, evaluate the ability of the
warehouse floor to bear the weight of additional storage, since some building pads
may be too thin.

When maximizing vertical storage space, try to store some items requiring
significant manual putaway and picking in low-height areas, since employees can
reach higher storage bins only with portable ladders, though a second-story
mezzanine could also be constructed. This policy will typically require you to
store items with high storage requirements in areas with higher vertical storage
capabilities, thereby maximizing storage per cubic foot.

17-16 Use Narrow Aisles in Manual Putaway and Picking Zones

The typical warehouse is laid out on the assumption that all aisles are of exactly the
same width, which is usually sufficiently wide for a forklift to put away or extract
items from racks. Though this makes for consistently wide aisles, there is a
potential loss of storage space in those areas where the items stored are all so small
that forklifts are not needed. The result is excessively wide aisles that could have
been used for more storage.

The solution is a plan for narrower aisles in the minority of situations where
manual putaways and picking are the norm. This best practice also can be used
when automated storage and retrieval systems are installed, since these systems
require far less operating width than a forklift.


384 Inventory Best Practices

If some kind of lift truck is still intended for use in a narrow-aisle environment,
there tends to be considerable damage to both the truck and the inventory when the
truck operator inevitable drifts out of the centerline of the aisle. To eliminate this
problem, narrow aisles can be equipped with either a rail or wire tracking system.
Trucks traveling down these aisles will automatically correct their direction of
travel to stay within a fraction of an inch of the aisle centerline.

The main problem with narrow aisles is making sure that the aisles are still
large enough for kitting carts to negotiate. If a company adopts a variety of batch-
picking techniques, pickers will likely need pick carts of some heft to accommo-
date portable scales and bins, so be sure to plan some additional aisle width for
the carts.

17-17 Eliminate the Warehouse

The source of many accounting-related transactions is the warehouse. This
department records entries for the receipt, movement, and issuance of parts to
and from stock. If any of these transactions are incorrect, the inventory quantities
used to derive the cost of goods sold, as well as of on-hand inventory, will be
incorrect. In addition, there is probably a fair amount of obsolete inventory
somewhere in the warehouse, which the accounting staff must identify and
cost out. These are major issues that can seriously impact the accuracy of the
financial statements.

A very difficult solution is the complete elimination of the inventory, which in
turns means the elimination of the warehouse. Several world-class companies have
achieved this best practice by switching to just-in-time receiving and production,
which allows them to bypass all parts storage. By doing so, a company can avoid
all of the transactions needed to log something in and out of the warehouse, not to
mention avoiding all the staffing, space, insurance, and inventory obsolescence
and damage costs that go along with having a warehouse. From the perspective of
the accounting staff, this is the ultimate best practice in inventory accounting, since
there is no inventory to account for besides the relatively minor amounts in work-
in-process.

Unfortunately, this is a goal that very few companies achieve, for a variety of
reasons. First, just-in-time receiving and production are very difficult concepts to
fully implement, given the difficulty of changing both internal processes and the
delivery systems of suppliers. Further, there may be some parts that are shipped
from long distances or that are difficult to obtain, and that must be kept in stock.
Finally, the existing inventory may take years to reduce to zero, unless a company
is willing to take write-downs to eliminate some stock or return it to suppliers at a
loss. Nonetheless, if a company can convert even some of its systems to just-in-
time, it is possible to send received parts directly to the production facility without


17-18 Audit All Inventory Transactions 385

spending any time in the warehouse; this reduces the number of inventory
transactions that can be made in error, resulting in an overall increase in the level
of accounting accuracy.

Cost: SIF Installation time:

17-18 Audit All Inventory Transactions

For any manufacturing organization, there are myriad transactions associated with
the receipt of goods, their transfer to locations in the warehouse, and additional
movement to the production floor, as well as the return of any excess items to the
warehouse. Given the inordinate volume of transactions, some are bound to be
done incorrectly. When this happens, the recorded quantities of inventory on hand
and used will be incorrect, resulting in incorrect financial results. The problem
impacts other departments, too, since inaccurate inventory volumes impact the
purchasing, production, and warehouse departments.

One solution is auditing inventory transactions. By doing so, you can spot
problems, research why they happened, and take action to keep the transaction
errors from occurring again. For example, if an audit uncovers a lack of operator
training that results in receiving not being completed in the computer, either a
comprehensive or focused training session with that person, along with follow-up
reviews, will eliminate the error.

Auditing can be assigned to the internal audit department. However,
continual review work may be necessary, which the audit department may
not have sufficient manpower to provide; the accounting department is well
advised to take on this chore itself, if no other approach will work. Once the
entity doing the work has been determined, the next step is to find the best way to
spot transaction problems among the hundreds or thousands of inventory-related
transactions that occur every month. A simple random selection of transactions
will eventually discover a reasonable quantity of mistakes to review, but there
are ways to improve your chances of finding them. For example, a transaction
that results in a negative inventory on-hand quantity is certainly worthy of a
review, as is any transaction that takes more out of stock than is actually there.
The same exception rules can be applied to transactions with inordinately large
quantities. Further, transactions can be compared to the production schedule to
see if any of the items received in the warehouse are scheduled to be used in
production in the near future. Any of these issues are indicative of a problem and
should be reviewed first. Though many of them may be valid, the odds of finding
an error are greatly enhanced.

The next step in the auditing process is discovering the nature of the problem
that caused the transaction error. Since the only two possibilities are systems or
people problems, it is wise to assign a team with exceptional systems knowledge
and people skills to this task. Since most employees will not admit to an error if


386 Inventory Best Practices

they have made one, the single most important auditing skill is carefully dealing in
a nonthreatening manner with the people involved in these transactions. Finally,
there must be a follow-up routine established that reviews previously uncovered
problems to verify that they have been fixed. Only if all of these steps are followed
will errors in the recording of inventory-related transactions be fixed.

As several departments are involved in inventory transactions, the controller
must be able to deal carefully with the managers of these other departments to
ensure that the auditing process does not degrade into a situation where discovered
problems are used to attack each other. Thus, interpersonal skills are critical to the
success of this solution.

17-19 Compare Recorded Inventory Activity
to On-Hand Inventories

Some industries deal with extremely expensive materials. In these situations, it is
critical to ensure that recorded inventory levels are completely accurate, since even
a small quantity variance can lead to a large impact on profitability. This is a
particular concern when dealing with precious metals or gemstones, not to mention
a variety of electronic components.

Many of the other best practices noted in this chapter will help to keep inventory
accuracy within reasonable limits, such as auditing inventory transactions or cycle
counting; but to be absolutely sure that quantities are correct, the best way is to
compare recorded inventory activity to on-hand inventories. This approach varies
from auditing because it assumes a 100 percent review of all transactions for selected
items. Because it is a highly labor-intensive approach, you must confine it to a
minimum number of especially expensive or critical inventory items.

To use this method, conduct a daily comparison of on-hand quantities to
every transaction associated with them, such as receipts, inventory moves, scrap,
production, returns from the production floor, and shipments. Of particular interest
during this review process is any transaction that is not made, is made twice, is
made in the wrong amount or on the wrong date, or involves the wrong part
number or unit of measure. Only by conducting this complete review every day can
acompany determine where there are problems in the stream of transactions and fix
them immediately. You should also try to spot trends in or concentrations of
transaction errors, such as a number of receiving or scrap errors, which allows you
to target a specific problem and fix it.

This best practice is strongly supported by those other departments that rely on
accurate inventory levels, such as the warehousing, production, and purchasing
departments. However, they support this because they do not have to provide the
significant amount of staff time required to ensure its success. Accordingly, a
controller should be extremely careful to use it only with a very small minority of the

inventory items, monitor it carefully, and eliminate items from the review process as
soon as it becomes apparent that there are no transactional errors occurring.

17-20 Eliminate the Physical Count Process

As noted in the last section, there are a variety of problems associated with having
any sort of physical count at all. This section outlines how to use cycle-counts to
completely avoid any physical count.

You should use cycle-counting as the primary way to eliminate the physical
counting process. To do so, there are a set of carefully defined steps to follow before
inventory reaches an accuracy level sufficiently high to allow you to avoid the physical
count. You should read through all of the following steps and make a realistic
assessment of a company’s ability not only to complete them but also to maintain the
system over a long period. If it is not realistically possible, then do not run the risk of
wasting up to a year of work on this project—there are other best practices in this
chapter that pose a much higher chance of success. The steps are as follows:

1. Throw out the trash. The warehouse must first be cleaned up before
spending a great deal of time on counting parts. Accordingly, trash, obsolete
parts, and old supplies or tools must either be thrown out or moved to an
outlying location.

2. Identify the remainder. The first step reduces the amount of inventory
items to be reviewed for part numbers. This is now the main task—review
all remaining inventory and post a part number on it.

3. Consolidate inventory. Once all parts are identified, cluster them together
for easy counting. This takes several iterations before all inventory is
completely consolidated, but do not worry about it—the main reason for
consolidating at this stage is to make it easier to count and box the inventory
in the next step, so a few unconsolidated items will not present a problem
later on.

4. Count and box the remainder. Count all the inventory and then box or bag
it. There should be a seal on each container, with the quantity marked on the
seal so that a glance at the container will reveal the complete quantity of the
part. This is of vast benefit to cycle-counters, who can now cycle-count
hundreds of items very quickly. Please note that it is not necessary at this
point to correct all inventory balances in the computer, for the cycle-
counters will soon take care of this problem when they methodically review
the entire warehouse.

5. Create warehouse locations. Clearly mark every bin location. The location
should include the aisle, rack, and bin number, so it is clear where an


388 Inventory Best Practices

inventory item is located. This step is crucial for cycle-counting, since one
cannot cycle-count if one cannot first find the part.

6. Assign inventory to specific locations. Go into the computer and assign a
location code to every inventory item. This may require special program-
ming to put a location field into the computer database.

7. Create a cycle-counting report. Create a computer report that lists all on-
hand inventory, sorted by location code. The cycle-counters must have this
available as their main tool for reviewing inventory.

8. Segregate the warehouse. Put up a fence around the warehouse and lock the
gate! Now that cycle-counting is about to begin, there should be no way for
nonwarehouse staff to enter the warehouse in order to take parts off the shelf.

9. Initiate cycle-counts. Assign cycle-counters a section of the warehouse to
count. Issue them the latest cycle-counting report. They must carefully
count all the items in every bin location and make corrections to the report to
ensure that the computer database is correct. The warehouse manager
monitors their progress every day to ensure that they are completing their
counts on time. A good initial cycle-counting frequency is to review the
entire inventory six times a year; this high volume of counting can drop
later, after accuracy levels increase.

10. Audit inventory accuracy. Audit the inventory once a week. A small
sample of the total inventory is sufficient to determine its total accuracy,
which should be posted for the review of the warehouse staff. It may be
necessary to post accuracy by aisle, in case some sections of the warehouse
are particularly prone to mistakes. If so, the best cycle-counters should be
assigned to these aisles.

11. Use a bonus program. Reward the entire warehouse staff with a bonus at
the end of each month, based on the audited accuracy of the inventory. A
good measure above which bonuses should be given is 95 percent accuracy,
with any item being defined as accurate if the counted quantity is within
2 percent of the amount listed in the computer (though this may not be a
good measure in some industries, such as diamond processing). This is an
extremely effective way to maintain the interest of the warehouse staff in the
continuing accuracy of the inventory records.

Though cycle-counting will certainly allow you to avoid a physical inventory
count, it is equally important to investigate why errors are occurring, not just to
change inventory balances if they are wrong. If you can get to the bottom of a
transaction problem and fix the underlying error, it is possible to greatly increase
record accuracy and require less work by the cycle-counting staff to keep it that
way.

17-21 Cycle-Count Based on Usage Frequency

The standard way to determine which inventory should be cycle-counted is to
count the most expensive items the most frequently. Accountants recommend this
approach, because it ensures the accuracy of the most expensive items in stock,
which gives them some reasonable assurance that the inventory value they record
in the financial statements is approximately correct.

The problem with this approach is that the accuracy of low-cost items is
considered less important, even though the absence of those items could poten-
tially keep an order from shipping, which negatively impacts revenue.

The solution is to base cycle-counts on the frequency of item usage, which
means that an item that is used continually is counted the most frequently. This
approach still satisfies accountants, because a high-cost item that does not move
much will still be accurate with just a few counts per year, since very little can
possibly happen to it if it just sits on a shelf. Conversely, an item that is constantly
cycling in and out of the warehouse will be counted a great deal, which will
hopefully ensure a high level of accuracy and therefore assist in avoiding stockouts
that could halt shipments.

Creating a cycle-count sample under a frequency-of-usage approach will
require a custom report from a materials planning system. To do so, accumulate the
number of putaways and picks per stock keeping unit on a rolling basis over the
past few months (possibly up to a year, if inventory turnover levels are low), and
then create a report that is sorted in declining order by volume of total putaways
and picks. This report can be used to manually select higher-frequency items for
more frequent counts.

However, this approach also requires record keeping to ensure that high-
frequency items are indeed counted more regularly than low-frequency items.
An alternative is to rearrange inventory so that higher-frequency items are stored
in specific aisle areas, for which an average usage frequency is calculated; then
count every item in each aisle area during a single count, and track the frequency
of cycle-counts for the entire block of inventory. This results in much less
recordkeeping.

17-22 Lock Down the Warehouse Area

The single most important cause of inventory inaccuracy is parts “walking out of
the warehouse.” This means that the physical layout of the warehouse allows
anyone to wander in and take any parts they need for the production process. When
this happens, there is no record that any item was taken from stock, so no one
knows what is left on the shelf, or even if there is anything left, which renders any
automated reordering system useless. From the accountant’s perspective, the


390 Inventory Best Practices

physical inventory count will probably be significantly different from what the
accounting records show, resulting in a large negative inventory variance at the end
of the year.

These problems can be eliminated by segregating the warehouse. This is done
by setting up a fence around the entire storage area and locking the gate when there
are no warehouse personnel on hand. In addition, there must be iron-clad rules
about who has a key to this gate. If too many keys are handed out, anyone will still
be able to enter the warehouse after hours. To prevent this, there should be no more
than one key given to the production personnel, and then only to the most
responsible person, who will faithfully mark down anything taken from the
warehouse. If possible, even this should be avoided by prepositioning any needed
parts outside of the warehouse for use by the production staff when the warehouse
staff is not available. Further, the warehouse staff must be carefully instructed as to
why no one but them is allowed in the warehouse; in addition, they should receive
training in how to process inventory transactions, and then be given a bonus plan
based on reaching high inventory accuracy levels. Only by taking all of these steps
will there be a good chance that nonwarehouse personnel can be kept out of the
warehouse and that the warehouse personnel are committed to a high level of
inventory accuracy.

This best practice is always opposed by the production department, which
claims that either it will be too time consuming to wait for the warehouse
department to pick parts from the shelf or that they will not be able to get any
parts at all if the warehouse staff is absent. The best way to allay these fears is to
have all systems in place and fully functional before locking down the warehouse.
By doing so, the production staff will find that there are no problems with the new
system and will have no complaints left to make.

17-23 Move Inventory to Floor Stock

The typical inventory contains an enormous number of small parts, many of
which are difficult to track, are not stored in easily countable containers, and
require a large amount of paperwork in proportion to their size and frequency of
usage. In short, they are a pain for the warehouse staff to handle. Likewise, they
represent a minor irritation for the accounting staff, since they must all be
counted during the physical inventory counting process, and, because of the
difficulty of counting them, they take up an inordinate amount of time. Further,
they can easily represent one third of the total number of inventory items, which
is one third more costing documentation than the accounting staff wants to track.
Accordingly, it is safe to say that the smallest and most inexpensive parts in
inventory are the root cause of a great deal of extra work for the employees of
several departments.


17-24 Segregate Customer-Owned Inventory 391

A solution is to shift the small inventory items out of the warehouse and onto
the shop floor, where they are treated as supplies. This approach carries the
multiple benefits of requiring far less inventory handling work from the warehouse
staff, fewer inventory counts during the physical inventory process, and much less
inventory-costing work from the accounting staff. In addition, it brings more
inventory close to the shop floor, where the production staff appreciates the readier
access, as well as not having to go to the parts counter to requisition additional
parts. This is one of the rare best practices greeted with universal approval by a
multitude of personnel, not just those in the accounting department.

Though this step can be taken quickly, be mindful of the danger of issuing a
quantity of expensive parts to the shop floor that may quickly disappear, resulting
in a significant loss. For these few costly items, it may be better to leave them in the
warehouse. Also, there must be a tracking system in place on the shop floor,
whereby someone can check part bins and determine which parts to reorder. There
are a variety of simple systems available that accomplish this, such as painting a
reorder fill line in each storage tray, or using a two-bin system, where parts are
reordered as soon as one bin is emptied. A manual reorder system is necessary for
shop supplies, since items are no longer stored in the inventory database, where
reordering can be done automatically, based on recorded inventory levels. Also,
some of the parts being pulled from the warehouse may be listed in bills of
material, which can be a problem if a company uses back-flushing. In this instance,
items will be automatically withdrawn from the quantity shown in the computer
system as soon as production is recorded, so the system will show negative usage
of items that are no longer there. You should carefully consider and resolve all of
these problems before moving parts out of inventory and into floor stock.

17-24 Segregate Customer-Owned Inventory

A dangerous problem for many controllers is incorrectly valuing inventory too
high because customer-owned inventory is mixed into it. This problem is
especially common where customers frequently ship components to a company
for inclusion in finished products. This situation arises when a customer has the
rights to a proprietary product component, prefers to do some finishing work on
selected components, or only wants a company to do final assembly work on its
products. When any of these situations arise, the receiving staff commonly makes
the mistake of recording receipts as company-owned stock and storing it alongside
all other inventory in the warehouse. As a result, the inventory can be massively
overvalued, leading to incorrectly reported profits.

A solution is to institute procedures and set up segregated areas that allow you
to promptly identify customer-owned products at the receiving dock and shunt
them immediately to the segregated area. By doing so, you can be assured of


392 Inventory Best Practices

having much more accurate inventory quantities and costs. To implement this best
practice, it is critical to require a purchase order on all items arriving at the
receiving dock. With this procedure in place, the receiving staff can identify all
receipts that the purchasing department has previously noted on a purchase order as
being owned by a customer. With this information in hand, the receiving staff
records the entry in the computer system and then moves the items to a separately
marked-off area. This approach results in the storage of item quantity information
in the computer system so the warehouse staff can easily find the parts but at a zero
cost, meaning the accounting staff does not make the mistake of increasing the
amount of company-owned inventory.

The main problem with using this methodology is that the purchasing and
warehousing departments must get used to issuing purchase orders for all items
received, while also rejecting all items shipped to the company without attached
purchase orders. Only by closely following these procedures can you be sure of
identifying all customer-owned inventory at the point of acceptance.

17-25 Streamline the Physical Count Process

Some companies find that they are unable to produce anything for several days
while count teams perform a physical count of all on-hand inventory. When this
happens, a corporation loses sales, since it cannot produce anything. In addition,
the resulting inventory is not entirely accurate, since the counting process may
include people who do not have a thorough knowledge of what they are counting,
which results in incorrect counts and misidentified parts. Also, key people are
taken away from their other work to conduct the count, resulting in little or no
attention to customers for the duration of the count. Finally, the accounting staff
usually stops all other work in order to devote themselves to the processing of
count tags. Thus, the physical count is a highly disruptive and inaccurate process.

For those organizations that cannot entirely dispense with the physical count,
itis still possible to streamline the process so that fewer resources are assigned to it,
while keeping the accuracy level relatively high. The improvements are as follows:

¢ Eliminate some inventory from the count with cycle-counting. For situa-
tions where a company has just started cycle-counting (see best practice 17—
20, “Eliminate the Physical Count Process,” earlier in this chapter) but has not
yet brought accuracy levels up to a sufficiently high level, it may still be
possible to concentrate the cycle-counting effort on a few key areas. By doing
so, the accuracy of the inventory in these locations will be so high that there is
no need to conduct a physical count.

¢ Enter location code on tags. When counters are entering information on
count tags, they should also enter a location code. With this information, it is


17-25 Streamline the Physical Count Process 393

much easier for the accounting staff to later locate where a tag was used to
record information, rather than wandering through the warehouse in a
frustrated search for the information. This approach is even better than the
common practice of tracking blocks of tags that are assigned to teams counting
specific locations; though this brings a review person to the general vicinity of
an inventory item, it does not precisely identify the location, which leads to
lost time while someone searches for the part.

¢ Enter tags directly into the computer. It is much more efficient to directly
enter tag information into the computer system, rather than entering it into an
electronic spreadsheet for manual comparison to a computer-generated inven-
tory report. This approach allows the computer to automatically issue a
comparison of the counted quantities to the quantities already stored in the
computer so that you can quickly determine where there may be counting
errors. Most good computer software packages contain this feature; if not, you
must evaluate the cost of programming the feature into the system.

¢ Identify all items in advance. A team should review the warehouse well in
advance of the physical count to spot all items that lack identifying part
numbers. By researching these items and correctly marking them in advance,
the counting teams do not have to address this task while also trying to count
inventory, thereby shortening the counting process.

¢ Allow only warehouse staff to count. Warehouse employees have an
excellent knowledge of all the parts stored in the warehouse and so are
the most qualified to identify and count inventory in the most efficient manner
possible. If other, less knowledgeable people are brought into the counting
process, it is much more likely that there will be counting problems, resulting
in wasted time at the end of the physical count, when extra counting teams
must be dispatched to research potential miscounts.

¢ Conduct only one count. Do not count something more than once! Though
some companies conduct a double count of all inventory items and then
conduct a comparison of the two counts to spot errors, it is much easier and
faster to complete a single count and compare this to the book balances already
stored in the computer system. Conducting a double count adds to the time and
effort needed to complete the counting process.

¢ Precount the inventory. A team should begin counting the inventory days
or weeks in advance of the formal physical inventory count. This group’s
job is to gather inventory into single locations, count it, seal it into
containers, and mark the correct quantity on the containers. By doing so,
it is much easier for the physical count teams to complete their work in an
efficient and accurate manner. Though this may seem like a considerable
amount of advance work (it is), it results in a much shorter interval for the
physical count, which allows a company to be shut down only for the
briefest possible time.

When these suggestions are implemented together or individually, a company
will experience significant reductions in the effort needed to complete a physical
inventory, while increasing the accuracy of the resulting information.

17-26 Track Inventory Accuracy

A controller is always concerned about the accuracy of the inventory. If it is off by
even a few percent at the end of the year, the annual physical count may result in a
large alteration in profits that will cost the controller his or her job on the grounds
that inaccurate financial statements have been issued. Furthermore, the purchasing
staff cannot properly order replacement parts if it does not have an accurate idea of
what is currently in stock, while the production department never knows when
parts are available for current jobs. Thus, all these departments are deeply affected
by the accuracy of the inventory.

The way to gain some assurance about overall levels of accuracy is to track

inventory accuracy with periodic audits. By doing so, you can determine if there is
an accuracy problem, resulting in further steps as outlined elsewhere in this
chapter, such as locking down the warehouse and shifting inventory into the floor
stock area. To review accuracy, print out a report from the computer system that
shows the inventory in each warehouse location. Then an accounting person
should take a sample of items from this report and verify that the items listed on it
are indeed in stock in the correct quantities, and that they are stored in the correct
locations. Similarly, a small sample of items should be traced from the shelf to the
report to verify that all items are being tracked in the computer system. Then divide
the total of all correct items by the total amount sampled to determine the accuracy
percentage. For even the largest warehouse, a sample size of 30 items is usually
sufficient to determine the accuracy of the entire facility. This information should
be reported to management and posted for the warehouse staff to see. By showing
this information to the warehouse staff and tying a series of bonus payments to it,
you can be assured of an improvement in the overall level of accuracy.
There is little resistance by anyone to tracking inventory accuracy, though
there are two systemic problems that may interfere with it. One is that the computer
system must be able to produce a report that sorts inventory by location—if not, the
auditing person cannot find items in the warehouse without a long search, turning
the audit into a tedious affair that can last hours. The other problem is that the
computer system must store location information for each part. If parts are
scattered throughout the warehouse with no record of their precise location, it
will be exceedingly labor intensive to track down anything. If these two problems
can be overcome, the auditing process becomes a simple and mechanical one that
only takes an hour or so to complete.

17-27 Train the Warehouse and Accounting Staffs 395

17-27 Train the Warehouse and Accounting Staffs
in Inventory Procedures

The underlying problem behind the bulk of all inventory record errors is a lack of
knowledge by warehouse workers in how to process a variety of inventory
transactions. As a result, cycle-counting teams waste time investigating errors;
the materials planning staff must order parts on short notice due to unexplained
materials shortfalls; the company incurs express delivery charges to bring in parts
on short notice; and the accounting staff must record unexplained losses related to
inventory adjustments.

Many of these problems can be mitigated by creating a procedures manual for
all inventory transactions and by continually training both the warehouse and
accounting staffs in their use. Examples of common inventory transactions are as
follows:

¢ Back-flushing

¢ Consignment receipts and deliveries

¢ Cycle-counting adjustments

¢ Inventory storage in rack locations

e Issuances

¢ Issuances of additional parts

¢ Kitting

¢ Loaning inventory to departments

¢ Receiving

¢ Receiving customer returns

¢ Removing defective parts from the production process
¢ Returning defective parts to suppliers

¢ Returning stock to the warehouse from the shop floor
¢ Shipping completed customer orders

¢ Staging for shipping

¢ Transferring between inventory locations

It is not enough to simply create a handsome procedures manual and issue it to
the staff. On the contrary, all employees involved with these transactions should go
through regular refresher training, while new employees should be trained several
times early in their employment and be certified by an experienced coworker as to
their knowledge of the procedures. Further, any procedural change calls for a
complete retraining of the entire staff on that topic. Only by enforcing the corporate
commitment to training in inventory procedures can a company reduce its
incidence of inventory transaction errors.

17-28 Initiate Warehouse Staff Self-Auditing

The bulk of all inventory record-keeping systems still require manual data entry of
inventory transactions into a computer system rather than the use of bar-code
scanners or radio frequency identification (RFID) to automatically track quantity
and location changes. Unfortunately, it is impossible to flawlessly enter data
manually, so most companies must deal with a certain amount of error investiga-
tion and correction. These errors can be traced to data entry, initial quantity
miscounts, incorrect picks, or incorrect identification or recording of inventory
items.

One way to reduce these errors is self-auditing within the warehouse depart-
ment. The basic concept is for employees to audit each other’s work, which can
range from a small sample size to a 100 percent test. Obviously, this approach is
only possible if there is a sufficient amount of staff time available. During peak
work periods, it is probably impossible, but there may be slack time when audits
can be squeezed in. Examples of inventory self-auditing include the following:

¢ Inventory pickers can compare one another’s picked orders to the authorizing
pick ticket.

¢ Data-entry clerks can compare input sheets to computer transaction logs.

* Cycle-counters can recount any exception conditions found by another cycle
counter.

* Cycle-counters can review others’ correcting entries in the inventory database.

There are two problems with self-auditing. First, it is difficult to ensure that
employees are actually conducting audits. Second, there may be peer pressure to
cover up mistakes. However, if the warehouse staff is partially compensated based
on inventory record accuracy, there should be enough pressure among the group to
overcome both of these problems.

17-29 Verify That All Receipts Are Entered in the Computer at Once

There is nothing that throws a wrench into a company’s production planning and
accounting more than the delayed entry of warehouse receiving into the computer
system. When this happens (or, rather, when it does not happen), the purchasing
staff does not know if materials have arrived and they begin a series of frantic calls
to suppliers to determine when items are to be shipped. Likewise, the production


17-30 Record Inventory Transactions with Bar Codes 397

scheduling staff decides not to produce something because they do not see any
receipt in the computer system. Finally, the accounting staff has a very difficult
time determining what was really received at the end of the accounting period,
resulting in the reporting of inaccurate inventory figures in the financial statements.
All this because someone in the warehouse is slow in entering receipts.

The obvious solution is to have the warehouse staff make receiving entries as
soon as the warehouse receives any parts, but the solution is not quite so simple.
The underlying reason that receipts are not being entered at once is probably
because the staff is too busy to do it, and so this chore waits until a slow period,
perhaps at the end of the day. Thus, to make the staff enter receipts more quickly,
one must find a better way to enter the receipts, one that is so simple and easy there
is no excuse to delay the process. One way is to require all suppliers to attach a bar-
coded sheet to all shipments, allowing the receiving staff to scan this sheet directly
into the computer system, thereby recording the entry. Another approach is to
restructure the receiving data-entry screen so that one only needs to enter the
purchase order number on which any receipt is based. The purchase order then
comes up on the screen, and the receiver quickly notes the quantity received. This
latter approach is also a good way to pay customers without the extra effort of using
the accounts payable staff (see Chapter 3). The latter approach carries with it the
added benefit of forcing suppliers to provide only the purchase order number with
their shipments—many suppliers resist having to bar code the information on their
shipments. Either technique is an effective way to reduce the time needed to enter
receipts, thereby eliminating a host of downstream problems.

17-30 Record Inventory Transactions with Bar Codes

There are many inventory transactions to record in the life of an SKU, such as
receipt, storage in a bin, transfer to the shop floor, and so on. Every time these
transactions are entered into the computer system, you must manually enter a
transaction code, the part number being moved, and typically the location code to
which it is being shifted. Each of these data items represents an opportunity for an
incorrect entry, which cumulatively results in a significant reduction in the
accuracy of inventory records.

Bar coding is a good, time-tested approach for improving the accuracy of
inventory transactions. In brief, the warehouse staff creates a bar-coded part
number for each item as it enters the warehouse and attaches the bar code to the
item. It also creates preset bar code labels for each warehouse location and posts
them at each location. Anyone moving stock then scans the part number bar code
and the bar code for the location to which it is being shifted, and manually enters a
quantity and transaction code to complete the transaction. This information is
typically entered on a portable scanner that can be either placed in a cradle to


398 Inventory Best Practices

upload information to the central computer system or used in real time with a built-
in radio to transmit and receive transaction information.

Although this approach can significantly reduce transaction errors, there are a
few problems to be aware of. First, if someone creates the wrong bar code label for
an item when it first enters the warehouse, then all transactions later using that bar
code will also be incorrect—a clear case of technology’s increasing the rate of
transaction errors, rather than the reverse. However, you can mitigate this problem
by setting the bar code printer to print not only the bar code but also the product
description and part number in English just below the bar code, so you can verify
the accuracy of the bar code. Another problem is the cost of this equipment.
Though a scanner can easily cost $2,000, and the rugged environment can lead to a
relatively short equipment life before replacement, the reduced transaction cost can
easily result in a headcount reduction in the warehouse that rapidly pays for the
investment. A third problem is the time interval between a scan into a portable
scanner and when its stored information is uploaded into the central computer
system. If a cycle-counter were to run an inventory report after a materials handler
had removed an item from stock but before the move had been recorded, she would
find an error during her count and enter a correcting transaction—resulting in
another error when the original scan was finally uploaded. The best solution is to
use real-time radio frequency scanning (see the following best practice) to upload
transactions immediately. Finally, the warehouse staff must be carefully trained in
the use of this equipment to ensure that scans are made correctly and properly
uploaded. You should schedule not only training for new employees but also
refresher training for the existing staff, as well as formal training in any incremental
improvements made to the system over time.

17-31 Record Inventory Transactions with Radio Frequency
Communications

Even if a company uses bar codes to accurately record inventory transactions, this
still does not address the problem of timeliness. A person could scan a bar code into a
portable device but not upload the data to a central database until the end of his shift,
resulting in a significant shortfall in database accuracy. If the materials handling staff
tries to solve the problem by routing their forklifts past a fixed terminal in order to
enter information, they are creating longer putaway or picking routes that contribute
to reduce labor efficiency. Further, if a company tries to install a warehouse
management system, it will be working with transactional data that could be hours
old, probably resulting in incorrect putaway or picking instructions to the staff, as
well as inaccurate inventories for cycle-counters to review.

The solution is radio frequency (RF) communications. This takes the form of
a handheld or truck-mounted computer, frequently integrated with a bar code


17-32 Track Inventory with Radio Frequency Identification 399

scanner that communicates by radio waves with a central warehouse database. For
example, a person picks a part from stock, scans the item’s bar code and the
location bar code from which it was taken, and enters the quantity withdrawn. The
portable unit immediately transmits this information to the central database, along
with a time stamp, so that the quantity in the inventory location is adjusted and a
picking record is created that can be used for a delivery to either a customer or the
production floor. If the database record indicates that there is not enough inventory
on hand to record the withdrawal, it can even send a query back to the employee,
asking for a recount of the bin’s contents. Thus, you can use an RF system to verify
transactions, achieve high rates of record accuracy, almost completely eliminate
paper-based transactions, and have a more efficient workforce.

Mechanically, an RF system begins with a transactional entry’s being trans-
mitted from a portable unit, which is received by a radio transponder that routes the
transaction through a network controller that essentially emulates a hardwired
computer terminal. From there, the information passes along the standard company
computer network to the company materials management database. Transaction
verifications flow along the same route back to the portable terminal. If there are
many portable units in use at one time, the radio transponder will poll the units in a
looping sequence until it finds one that wants to deliver a transaction, and then it
continues with the polling after receiving the transaction. An alternative approach
is for the portable units to transmit transactions only when other units are not
transmitting.

A significant problem with RF systems is interference caused by factory
equipment. Prior to installing an RF system, you should have the supplier tour all
corners of the warehouse, and anywhere else where the portable RF units may be
used, to ensure that there are no “dead” zones from which transmissions cannot be
made. It is also possible for a large number of portable units to cause a bottleneck
on the main company network, simply because of the large volume of transactions
they are initiating. This can be corrected by increasing the network throughput at
whatever bottleneck is causing the problem.

17-32 Track Inventory with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)

A major problem with any manually operated inventory system is the vast number
of transactions required to track receipts into the warehouse, moves between bins,
issuances to the shop floor, returns from the floor, scrap, and so on. Every time
someone creates a transaction, there is a chance of incorrect data being entered,
resulting in a cumulative variance that can be quite large by the time a stock item
has wended its way through all possible transactions. Incorrect inventory infor-
mation leads to a host of other problems, such as stockouts, incorrect purchasing
quantities, and a seriously inaccurate cost of goods sold.


400 Inventory Best Practices

One way to avoid these transactional errors is to use RFID technology. The
basic RFID concept is to attach a tiny transmitter to each product, which then sends
a unique encoded product identification number to a reader device. The cost of
these transmitter tags is about 10 cents, which begins to make it a cost-effective
alternative for some applications. Growing use of the technology will likely reduce
the cost further.

When a tagged inventory item passes near a reader device, the reader emits a
signal, which powers up the tag, allowing it to emit its unique product identifica-
tion number. In order to read a large number of tags, the reader turns on each tag in
sequence, reads it, and turns off the tag, thereby preventing confusion with
repetitive reads. The tag information is then logged into the inventory tracking
system, indicating an inventory move past the point where the reader was located.

The most likely implementation scenario for RFID is to begin by rolling it out
within the warehouse and manufacturing areas of a company, first using it to track
entire pallet loads (good for receiving and inventory control transactions), and then
implementing it for smaller tracking units, such as cases (good for picking, cycle-
counts, and shipment transactions) or even individual items (most applicable for
work-in-process [WIP] inventory or retail applications). This implementation
approach allows for a gradually increasing investment in the technology as a
company gradually learns about its applicability.

A major advantage of RFID is its ability to provide inventory count informa-
tion without any manual transaction keypunching. This eliminates the need for
manual receiving, inventory move, and issuance transactions. It can also provide
real-time information about the precise location of all inventory, which can assist
with locating missing inventory, arranging cycle-counts, and auditing stock. If
issued to suppliers, this information tells them precisely how much inventory is
currently on hand, so they can more accurately determine when to deliver more
stock to the company.

One problem with RFID is the possibility of radio interference, which can be a
major problem in heavy manufacturing environments. As a general rule, if wiring
into the warehouse and shop area must already be shielded in order to ensure
proper data transmission, then RFID may not work. If this potential exists, then be
sure to conduct extensive transmission testing in all areas where inventory may be
tracked to ensure that radio interference will not be an issue. Another problem is
that certain products, such as steel or fluids, obviously cannot be tagged.

An additional problem is that RFID is simply too new. Few case studies have
been made, so it is difficult to determine what other problems will arise.

17-33 Eliminate All Paper from Inventory Transactions

Every time someone handles a piece of paper listing an inventory transaction, there
is a chance of losing the paper, misconstruing its contents, or transcribing it back


17-34 Installa Kanban System 401

into the computer system with an error. This problem is especially prevalent in the
handling of inventory, since there is a potential for a paper-based transaction at
every step in the handling of inventory—receiving, quality assurance, putaway,
moves, picking, scrap, shipping, and so on.

The best solution is the complete avoidance of paper documents for all
inventory transactions. This can be done through best practices already noted—bar
coding and RFID. As an example of how you can use these technologies to avoid
paper-based transactions, you can use a bar-coded scanner to record the receipt of
an incoming item, scan the bar code again when the item is put away, scan it yet
again when picked, and scan it one last time upon either shipment or delivery to the
shop floor. As an alternative to bar coding, an RFID system requires no scanning at
all—a radio chip attached to each pallet, case, or item transmits its location to
receiving stations as it moves about the company premises. These technologies
have the added benefit of requiring much less or no employee labor, so they can
concentrate on their primary tasks and have no opportunity to incorrectly record a
transaction.

The downside of all these alternatives to paper-based transactions is their cost.
Virtually all alternatives require an investment in the real-time updating of
inventory records. However, you should compare this added investment to the
cost of correcting transactional errors related to the use of paper, which frequently
reveals that paper avoidance is a very cost-effective policy.

17-34 Installa Kanban System

The typical manufacturing system pushes materials through the production
facility. Under this “push” system, materials planners calculate the total number
of finished units required through a forecasting system, explode this requirement
back into individual parts requirements, and send picking information to the
warehouse, which pulls the items from storage and sends them to the production
area. This approach requires a great deal of planning throughout the production
facility. Also, any breakdown in the process will halt production, resulting in large
amounts of WIP being shunted off to one side until the materials flow problem is
fixed. Further, there can be an enormous number of inventory transactions in this
system if management thinks it is necessary to track the flow of parts between
workstations on the shop floor; whenever there are many transactions, the odds of
having incorrect data entry increase, so inventory records are much more likely to
be incorrect.

A possible alternative in a job shop environment is to switch to a “pull”
system, where parts are only requested from a preceding workstation if they are
needed in order to complete a required product. Under this approach, a parts
notification, or “kanban” is sent to the preceding workstation, authorizing the

completion of a specific number of parts. Once that authorization is filled, work at
the preceding workstation stops until it receives another authorization. The kanban
can take a number of forms, such as a card or perhaps a tray whose receptacles can
be filled up to a predetermined quantity. The approach can also be extended to
include suppliers, which eliminates the need for purchase orders. The kanban
system almost entirely eliminates the need for transaction data entry, requiring
only the accumulation of information about the total number of finished goods
produced, which can then be used for shipment and supplier payment transactions.
By massively reducing the number of transactions in the system, data-entry errors
can be greatly reduced, while the production staff is no longer required to record
transactions.

The main problem with the kanban system is the difficulty of switching from a
push to a pull system. This can cause the near-breakdown of the production
process, so proceed with great care, using consultants, pilot tests, and extensive
training before switching over. The kanban system is also not of much use in
process flow environments, where the production system is designed for maxi-
mum, continual production. Further, the pull system will result in slower customer
service, since items can no longer be shipped directly from stock to customers, but
must first be manufactured.

17-35 Eliminate All Transaction Backlogs

The warehouse staff gets into serious trouble when it develops a permanent
backlog of inventory transactions, usually in the areas of receiving, moves between
bin locations, picking, and receipts from the shop floor back into the warehouse.
When a backlog arises, inventory records are not being updated on time, rendering
inaccurate the reports used by cycle-counters to verify inventory quantities and
locations. If cycle-counters use these inaccurate reports, they will undoubtedly find
differences between the inventory database and their physical counts, and will
make entries into the computer system to eliminate the differences—which will not
improve the record accuracy situation once any unentered transactions are included
in the inventory database. Thus, a transaction backlog results in permanent inventory
record inaccuracy. Further, transaction backlogs tend to create piles of paper-
work in which other documents can be lost, resulting in extra search time to locate
needed materials.

A crucial best practice is to eliminate these backlogs, usually by allocating
extra staff time to do them. Once the piles of paperwork are eliminated, the
warehouse manager can focus on increasing levels of training and process
improvement to reduce the number of people required to keep the backlog
from recurring. Real-time, online data entry using wireless bar-coded scanners
is an excellent method for having forklift operators update inventory move


17-37 Reduce the Number of Products 403

transactions on the fly, so there is no paperwork for anyone to keypunch at a later
date. You can also use real-time entry of receipts at the receiving dock by having a
computer terminal stationed there. The main point is to make transaction entries at
the time of initial occurrence as easy as possible, so there is no need for the
warehouse staff to delay the data-entry task.

If the warehouse has a highly variable amount of transaction volume, some
backlog may reappear in periods of high activity, though this can be avoided
through the careful use of the preplanned hiring of part-time workers to assist the
regular staff.

17-36 Immediately Review All Negative Inventory Balances

The impact of a variety of transactional problems can result in the computer
system’s reporting a negative inventory balance. Source problems could include
the presence of a transaction backlog where offsetting entries have not yet been
made, incorrect cycle counts, improper counts at the receiving stage, picks from
stock without an update to the inventory records, and so on. Whatever the cause,
negative balances are a clear indicator of inadequate warehouse management, and
show that the inventory database cannot be reliably used for materials planning,
much less inventory valuation.

The solution is to immediately investigate all negative inventory balances.
Investigation means not just correcting the book balance to match the on-hand
balance but also reviewing all underlying transactions to find the reason for the
negative balance and following through to ensure that the problem does not happen
again. You should create a procedure for spotting negative balances right away.
Also, include in the daily warehouse activity list a requirement to print an
inventory report sorted in ascending order by quantity on hand, so negative
balances appear at the top of the report. Also, since cycle-counters should have
expertise in resolving inventory problems, have them correct and investigate the
negative balances as part of their daily cycle-counting routines.

17-37 Reduce the Number of Products

The sales department loves to shower customers with a broad range of products to
fit every possible need. A company can certainly maximize its sales by doing so.
The problem is that it is not maximizing its profits. With an enormous range of
product offerings comes a massive investment in finished goods inventory, since
many of the products will sell only occasionally but must still be stocked against


404 Inventory Best Practices

the possibility of an order. Further, raw materials and subassemblies must be
stocked in case more products are needed. In addition, the rates of obsolescence
will be higher with more products, since some products will almost certainly be
overproduced and will languish in the warehouse for years.

The solution is a periodic planned review of the entire range of product
offerings, with the intent of eliminating the slow-moving items. The accounting
staff must be heavily involved in this effort, reporting on sales trends, inventory
investment, and direct profits by product. The sales department will resist the
reduction on the grounds that sales will be lost, so the company should involve
senior management in the process in order to enforce the decision to eliminate
products.

The primary downside to this best practice is the initial reduction in earnings
caused by inventory write-offs when it is first implemented, since a number of
products may require pruning.

17-38 Reduce the Number of Product Options

Design engineers like to offer a wide range of product options from which
customers can choose. The assumption is that customers will perceive a company
to have a high degree of customer service by offering products in a multitude of
variations. The trouble with this approach is the considerable expansion in the
number of subassemblies and items that must be kept in stock to deal with the full
range of possible variations in product configurations. In many cases, specific
configurations are ordered so rarely that inventory must be stored for long periods
prior to use; the odds of eventual obsolescence due to nonuse are also high.
The solution is to offer customers a greatly reduced set of product options.
You can then reduce the number of inventory items kept in stock to those used on a
small number of basic offerings. This approach does not mean that customers are
offered only a “bare-bones” product—on the contrary, a fully loaded product is
quite acceptable, but the number of variations from that fully loaded model must be
kept low in order to avoid retaining inventory for rarely ordered features. Customer
satisfaction levels will still remain high as long as they can choose from a clustered
set of features offering them the choice of minimal extras at a low price, many
features at a high price, and just one or two variations between these two extremes.

17-39 Design Products with Lower Tolerances

Engineers love to design superior products, incorporating the tightest possible
part tolerances that will achieve uncommonly high product performance. When


17-40 Obtain Direct Links into Customer Inventory Planning 405

they do this, the purchasing department must obtain components falling within the
designed tolerance limit or the production department must create them. When this
happens, the purchasing staff must pay a higher price for the high-tolerance items.
Alternatively, the production department will generate more scrap as it struggles to
manufacture parts falling within extremely tight tolerance limits, resulting in more
raw materials to offset the increased scrap level.

The solution is to design products whose functions still meet customer
expectations, but which do so with the lowest possible tolerances. By doing
so, the purchasing staff can specify the lower tolerance levels when buying parts,
resulting in lower purchase prices, while the production department can accept
manufactured parts falling within a larger tolerance range. The resulting lower
scrap levels means that the materials management staff can plan for a smaller
investment in raw materials inventory.

This best practice requires a long time to implement, since it is usually difficult
to alter tolerances for existing products; instead, you have to wait for a full range of
new products to be designed, gradually flushing out the old, higher-tolerance
products.

Cost: SF Installation time:

17-40 Obtain Direct Links into Customer Inventory
Planning Systems

The purchasing department usually places orders based on the requirements output
by a material requirements planning (MRP) system. Although this output may
appear to be precise, it is still driven by an estimate of what someone in the sales
department thinks customers are most likely to purchase. Consequently, despite the
appearance of a great deal of precision in the types and quantities of parts ordered, the
purchasing staff’s efforts may still result in excess inventory or shortages.

A solution is to actively pursue direct system linkages with the inventory
planning systems of customers. By doing so, you can eliminate all estimates from
the planning process and avoid considerable amounts of excess quantities for some
inventory items and shortages for others.

The problem is getting customers to agree to reveal their demand information.
This can be achieved by suggesting some type of shared cost savings, or by
promising long-term fixed pricing, and so on—the inducement must be sufficient
to attract the customer’s attention, while at the same time not being too expensive
for the company. Another approach is to offer the customer free software with
which it can more easily place orders to the company, which yields a less efficient
manual linkage to the customer. Given the time required to achieve direct customer
linkages, this best practice is usually cost effective only for the largest customers.

406 Inventory Best Practices

17-41 Adopt Just-in-Time Purchasing

A core inventory reduction problem is a company’s reliance on a demand forecast,
which inherently introduces a risk of demand inaccuracy based on the perceptions
of the people creating the forecast.

The only way to eliminate inventory fluctuations based on an inaccurate
forecast is to eliminate the forecast. This requires the complete reorientation of the
purchasing (and manufacturing) system from one that pushes materials through the
production process based on a forecast, to one that pulls items from production
based on actual customer orders. Under this demand-pull approach, when a new
customer order is received, the manufacturing operation is authorized to build
exactly enough units to fill the order, which in turn requires an order to a supplier
for the exact amount of materials needed to fill the company’s purchasing
requirement.

This is an advanced best practice requiring the completion of the following
activities prior to its implementation:

1. Certify supplier quality levels. It makes no sense for suppliers to deliver
shoddy goods directly to the production department, so every supplier’s
production process must be certified in advance.

2. Communicate materials needs to suppliers. Suppliers need to know
exactly when materials are needed, so the company must find a way to
communicate this information to them. A sound approach is to allow them
online access to the company’s materials planning database.

3. Alter the accounts payable process. If suppliers bypass the receiving
department, there will be no receiving documents from which to authorize a
payment. Instead, the accounts payable staff must be trained to make
payments based on scheduled deliveries, as shown in the materials planning
system.

4. Arrange for limited storage facilities near the production process. If
there is no room for inventory near the production department, the area will
be choked with inventory deliveries. It is better to arrange for sufficient
inventory storage in strategic locations and show suppliers exactly where
their deliveries are to be made.

5. Arrange for small, frequent supplier deliveries. Storage near the produc-
tion floor is likely to be limited, so suppliers must be able to make small-
quantity deliveries to avoid overburdening the storage areas. This will call
for frequent deliveries in order to avoid stockouts.

You must first address all five of these activities before just-in-time purchasing
can be successfully implemented, so the implementation period can be quite long.
Also, some suppliers will never pass the quality certification process, which

requires their replacement with better suppliers or a more limited receiving
function to handle their deliveries.

Cost: SAL Installation time:

17-42 Shift Raw Materials Ownership to Suppliers

The raw materials portion of a company’s inventory can consume a major part of
its working capital investment, money that could otherwise be used for other
activities. Also, the occasional purchase of excessive quantities of stock will
eventually result in a large proportion of the inventory being obsolete. Manu-
facturing companies will find that these are particularly large problems that have a
major impact not only on cash flow but also on profits.

One way to mitigate the adverse effect of raw materials inventory is to shift its
ownership to suppliers. Under this scenario, suppliers deliver goods to the company
in whatever quantities they want, above a designated minimum, as long as they do
not exceed the physical storage area set aside for their use. The company logs these
items out of the storage area when it uses them and pays the supplier for the amounts
used. This has the obvious impact of eliminating a company’s investment in raw
materials, and shifts the burden of obsolescence to the supplier. In exchange, the
supplier obtains a single-source contract with the company, ensuring itself of sales
for at least one year and possibly for several, and using a pricing schedule that both
parties have agreed to in advance. In addition, the supplier can park extra inventory at
the customer location, thereby avoiding the cost of just-in-time deliveries.

Unfortunately, there are several problems with this best practice that limit its
practical application. First, it is generally limited to nearby suppliers that can
regularly monitor stocking levels at the company location. Second, the company
must be willing to share its material requirements information with suppliers.
Third, the company must be willing to sole source large portions of its inventory.
Fourth, any custom parts made or obtained by the supplier will ultimately be paid
for by the company, even if it never uses them, since the supplier has no other
means for liquidating the stock. Fifth, the company is responsible for any inventory
discrepancies, since these problems typically arise through the lack of knowledge
of inventory-tracking procedures by its own staff. Within these restrictions, many
companies with large raw material inventories will find that the prospective
elimination of at least some of their inventory investment is well worth the effort.

17-43 Drop Ship Inventory

A typical set of inventory transactions involves receiving items, moving them to a
quality review area, checking them, moving them again to main storage, picking


408 Inventory Best Practices

them for an order, assembling and packaging the order, and shipping it. Not only
does this process require a large number of transactions, any of which could be
made in error, but it also involves a great many “touches” of the inventory,
increasing the odds of product damage.

In situations where a company is purchasing a finished product from
a supplier, turning around and selling it to a customer, there is a possibility
of using drop shipping. Under this approach, the supplier ships the product
directly to the customer, bypassing the company’s warehouse entirely. By
doing so, all of the transactions and risks of product damage just noted are
eliminated. This is the ultimate approach to storing inventory—there is nothing
to store. It is an especially attractive option for large items, which would
otherwise require special handling and take up considerable space within the
warehouse.

Unfortunately, drop shipping is an option only in the minority of situations.
Many suppliers are unwilling to ship directly to customers, especially if shipment
sizes are smaller than full pallets; issuing small shipments increases a supplier’s
costs, so the company may have to accept a supplier price increase in exchange for
this service. Another problem is the need for new procedures to handle drop
shipments. The accounting department must be trained to accept a shipment
notification from the supplier, so it can issue an invoice to customers and also have
a control point in place for verifying if no shipment notification has been received.
Further, the company may not want the customer to know the name of the supplier,
since the customer could theoretically purchase the product at a lower price directly
from the supplier.

17-44 Reduce Safety Stocks by Accelerating
the Flow of Internal Information

A typical reordering scenario is for the warehouse manager to forward to the
purchasing department a daily list of items requiring reordering. This goes by
intercompany mail to the purchasing department, which places it in the department
inbound work queue. After some time passes, the request reaches the top of
the stack, and a purchasing person confirms the need for the item, obtains
supervisory approval, and then mails a purchase order to a supplier. The total
lag caused by all these activities and wait times can easily exceed a week; during
this time, the inventory level continues to decline, possibly resulting in a stockout
before the delivery arrives from the supplier. When this problem goes on for some
time, the purchasing staff starts to lengthen the item lead times in its database,
forcing the company to order sooner and sooner. The result is long lead


17-45 Reduce Safety Stock by Shrinking Supplier Lead Times 409

times for many items, requiring extremely long time horizons for product
forecasting, which becomes inherently more difficult when stretched further
into the future.

To avoid longer lead times caused by internal communications problems, we
must shrink the time required to notify suppliers of new purchasing requirements.
This can involve a number of system improvements, such as having a computer-
ized materials planning database automatically issue purchase orders to suppliers
without human intervention, based on the production plan and existing stock
levels, and transmitting the purchase orders by e-mail to avoid mail float. If such an
advanced solution is not possible, then you can fax purchase orders to suppliers,
require less supervisory approval of purchase orders, employ runners to move
reorder requests more quickly within a company, and use extra staff to eliminate
the queue of purchasing requests in the purchasing department.

The variety of improvement possibilities will require the active cooperation of
the purchasing manager, since all the changes impact his or her area of responsi-
bility. If there is resistance, then a senior manager must intervene to require
implementation of the improvements.

17-45 Reduce Safety Stock by Shrinking Supplier Lead Times

A company goes to great lengths to reduce its internal lead times by a variety of
just-in-time techniques, but it tends to accept the lead times handed to it by
suppliers. These lead times are frequently not even based on the supplier’s actual
production capabilities but are simply the lead times announced by the salesperson
with whom a company deals. The result is long lead times, which a company deals
with by investing in excessively large safety stocks.

The purchasing department can shorten supplier lead times by including a
reduced delivery time in its request for quotes. By specifying short lead times up
front, a supplier realizes that this is an important criterion for a company, and must
commit to it before there will even be any discussion of orders. This can have an
added benefit for suppliers, since by being forced to revamp their internal processes
to improve their lead times they will now have a new basis on which to compete.

Sometimes an even simpler approach to reducing lead times may have a
positive impact—specify the exact date and time of expected receipt on the
purchase order. By making it clear that the company has a high expectation of
receipt within a very narrow time frame, suppliers become more aware of the
importance of this issue.

This best practice does not mean that you should force impossibly short lead
times on suppliers, just that lead time should be a prime focus of discussion with
suppliers, rather than being blindly accepted by the company.

17-46 Reduce Safety Stock with Risk Pooling

Risk pooling is the concept that safety stock levels can be reduced for parts
that are used in a large number of products because fluctuations in the demand
levels of parent products will offset each other, resulting in a lower safety
stock level.

For example, engineers are usually instructed to use common parts in more
than one product so that fewer total parts can be stocked (another inventory
reduction technique). A useful side benefit of this approach is that the fluctuations
in the demand levels of a single part by multiple parent products will offset each
other. This results in a smaller standard deviation in usage levels for a part having
multiple sources of demand, as opposed to the usage deviation for parts with fewer
sources of demand.

In order to reduce safety stock levels for parts having multiple sources of
demand, use a simple trial-and-error approach of determining the actual stockout
level of these items over a rolling three-month period and gradually reducing the
in-stock balance until the mandated service level is reached. For these items, the
safety stock level will likely be substantially below the average corporate safety
stock level.

Cost: Sy Installation time: 8o

17-47 Use Variable Safety Stocks for Fluctuating Demand

Most materials planning systems include a feature that calculates an adequate
safety stock level based on parts usage levels and supplier lead times. If a company
experiences a steady level of demand, this approach will yield reliable safety
stocks. However, what if demand fluctuates to a high degree, as is the case for
seasonal sales? When this occurs, safety stocks calculated during a low-demand
period will result in repeated stockouts, while safety stocks calculated during a
high-demand period will result in an excessive inventory investment. Even the
midway approach of using a safety stock level based on the average level of
demand satisfies no one—still some stockouts during high-usage periods, and still
too much inventory during low-usage periods.

The solution is to obtain materials planning software that allows for variable
safety stocks. These systems automatically reset safety stock levels as forecasted
demand levels change, so the conflicting objectives of minimal stockouts and
minimal inventory levels are both balanced. If the existing system does not contain
this feature, the software development staff may be able to program it into the
existing system.


17-48 Cross-Dock Inventory 411

A low-budget approach is to schedule a quarterly review of safety stocks,
focusing on those impacting the largest dollar value of inventory, and manually
adjust safety stocks at that time. Since the materials management staff rarely
has time for such a review, be sure to examine only the highest-investment
safety stocks, so the review results in a significant impact on inventory
investment and stockout levels in exchange for the minimum amount of staff
review time.

Cost: - Installation time:

17-48 Cross-Dock Inventory

As noted under best practice 17-43, “Drop Ship Inventory,” there are a great many
inventory transactions and physical moves required if an item is brought into a
warehouse, stored, retrieved, and shipped. All these moves introduce the possi-
bility of creating an incorrect transaction or damaging items. Though the drop
shipping approach completely eliminates this problem, it is not always possible
to do so, either because suppliers refuse to ship direct, container sizes must
be reconfigured prior to final delivery, or items from multiple suppliers must be
combined into a single shipment.

If drop shipping is not possible, cross-docking may be an alternative. Under
this approach, items arrive at the receiving dock and are immediately shifted across
to a shipping dock for immediate delivery. By doing so, the only inventory
transactions are for receiving and shipping, while the only inventory move is from
one dock to another. There is no quality review, putaway, or picking transaction at
all. Because of these missing transactions, the use of warehouse staff is kept to a
minimum.

To make cross-docking work, inbound deliveries must have a high enough
level of product quality to eliminate the quality assurance review, which would
otherwise create a potential delay in the delivery of shipments to customers. Also,
there must be excellent control over the timing of inbound deliveries, so the
warehouse manager knows exactly when items will arrive. This is especially
critical when some parts of a customer order must still be picked, since the picking
transaction should be completed just prior to the arrival of a delivery containing the
remaining items in a customer order. Further, the computerized warehouse
management system must be sufficiently sophisticated to tell the receiving staff
that items are to be cross-docked, as well as the number of the shipping dock to
which items must be shifted for delivery. Finally, this approach requires a number
of docks, since trailers may have to be kept on-site longer than normal while loads
are accumulated from several inbound deliveries.

412 Inventory Best Practices

17-49 Use Overnight Delivery from a Single Location
for Selected Items

It makes a great deal of sense to store most types of inventory in distribution
warehouses strategically located in a company’s primary markets or near major
customers. By doing so, you can more easily ship products to customers on short
notice. However, this approach does not work well for the minority of products
having uncertain demand levels. It is impossible for material planners to estimate
how much of these items to stock in each distribution warehouse, so they face the
alternatives of frequent stockouts or the expense of an excessive inventory
investment (especially for those items having a high unit cost).

An inexpensive best practice that resolves this issue is to retain high-value
items with uncertain demand levels in a central warehouse, and use overnight
delivery services to ship them to customers when needed. By doing so, material
planners can store a large quantity of the items in one location, rather than in
several. The cost of overnight delivery services is usually minor in comparison to
the saved inventory investment. However, this best practice works less well for
bulkier items, since express delivery expenses rise dramatically with the size of the
shipment. Consequently, you should conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine
the maximum item size beyond which it is impractical to ship items from a central
location.

It may also be necessary to alter the customer order system so that orders
placed for items retained in the central storage facility are automatically flagged
and forwarded to that location for immediate shipment.

17-50 Focus Inventory Reduction Efforts on High-Usage Items

When the directive is handed down to reduce the total company investment in
inventory, the materials management staff tends to throw up its hands in dismay
and tackle the directive for all the thousands of items in stock. The result is a pitiful
effort on a per-unit basis, since the materials management staff can devote only a
minor amount of time to this goal. Due to the broad scope of its efforts, the
company’s inventory investment may not decline at all.

A solution is to focus their attention only on the reduction of high-usage items.
There are several reasons for doing so. First, by definition, slow-moving items are
not going anywhere soon, so the materials management staff would have to wait a
long time before the natural ongoing usage of these items will bring about any sort
of reduction. Conversely, the turnover speed of high-usage items will cause a rapid
inventory reduction in short order. Second, high-usage items represent a small
portion of the total items in stock, so the staff can focus on reducing the quantity of

far fewer items, resulting in both more attention to fewer items and plenty of
leftover time for the staff to complete other tasks.

17-51 Eliminate Redundant Part Numbers

When a company consolidates multiple locations in an effort to streamline its
engineering and purchasing functions, a common problem is the discovery of
duplicate part numbers, since each location has assigned a different part number to
the same part. Part duplication is also common when many new products are being
launched at the same time, since multiple engineers are needed at the same time for
design work, and they may not be aware of part designations being made by their
counterparts. It also occurs when a company switches to a new supplier, since the
person assigning part numbers may not be aware of existing designations.
Whatever the reason may be, redundant part numbers typically result in a
considerable increase in the amount of on-hand inventory.

The key task in eliminating redundant part numbers is finding these parts.
There are several methods for doing so. One is to simply ask the warehouse staff’s
cycle-counters, who have the best knowledge of what parts are currently on hand.
Though this approach will highlight some duplicates, it will not spot everything—
cycle-counters are frequently assigned to specific warehouse aisles and so have no
knowledge of what lies elsewhere in the warehouse. Also, they frequently count
sealed containers and have no idea of their contents.

Another possibility is to audit a sample of the inventory, deliberately looking
for duplicate parts. This will eventually spot some duplicates but is more effective
when the warehouse is organized by part type, so you can conduct 100 percent
audits of selected bins and aisles.

Yet another approach is to assign meanings to part numbers so that certain
letters or numbers in each part number refer to a type of part. By using this
approach, you can review certain ranges of part numbers for duplicates. Though
this approach initially appears attractive, it can quickly become unwieldy if a
company must renumber all the parts of an acquired company to match its internal
numbering system. Also, unless very carefully laid out, a part-numbering scheme
can run out of space for new parts. Further, you must run the part-numbering task
through a single person or small group who are responsible for assigning “smart”
part numbers, which can become a bottleneck. Thus, despite its initial attractive-
ness, this approach is not heavily used.

Whichever of the preceding approaches is used, there are several additional
implementation steps to follow once duplicate parts are found. You must assign a
single part number to all parts found in the warehouse with other part numbers,


414 Inventory Best Practices

alter the related quantity information in the inventory database, designate the old
part numbers in the item master file as inactive, adjust any outstanding purchase
orders using the old part numbers, modify bills of material to include only the
single remaining part number, and also alter any engineering drawings to reflect
the changed number. Thus, a great many steps are required to ensure that more
inventory items using the duplicate part numbers are not inadvertently ordered as
replacements.

17-52 Standardize Parts

Though you can certainly use the steps just noted in best practice 17-51,
“Eliminate Redundant Part Numbers,” to reduce the number of items in the
inventory, this still does not eliminate those similar, but still slightly different, parts
designed to be used in different products. The engineering department has
probably created a series of products without regard to the components used in
preceding designs, so fittings, fasteners, and other items are used in slightly
varying sizes across a range of products. The result is an ever-growing list of
components, each one varying just enough from other items to require separate
stocking.

A long-term solution is to standardize parts across multiple products, thereby
greatly reducing the number of items in stock. The key ingredient in this best
practice is to require approval of all new components by the engineering manager,
whose performance is judged partially on his or her ability to keep the number of
parts at a minimum. By requiring engineers to go through a tough review before
being allowed to use new parts, they will be much more inclined to design existing
stocks into new designs. A useful tool in the identification of commonly used parts
is the matrix bill of material; this format displays the components of similar
products in a side-by-side format so that visual comparisons can be more easily
made.

The concept can be taken further by reviewing the on-hand components list
and winnowing out those for which there is clear duplication in similar compo-
nents. By reducing the approved parts list in this manner, the number of compo-
nents used in new products can be gradually reduced. Further, the engineering
manager can gradually eliminate the use of redundant parts in existing products by
using engineering change notices to eliminate some components from use. This
last step is the most difficult, since you must alter work instructions and the bill of
material, as well as dispose of excess parts. The easier approach by far is to limit
engineers to a specific parts list and design parts standardization into new products.

An ideal time to implement a parts standardization program is following an
acquisition, since an obvious synergy is to standardize parts for both organizations.


Summary 415

Another project initiation trigger is the implementation of an MRP system, since
MRP reports make it much easier to review bills of material in a matrix format for
similar parts. Finally, parts standardization can be implemented as part of a new
product phase-in, which may be triggered by the scheduled end of a product life
cycle, a change in suppliers, engineering change orders, or product upgrades due to
safety or feature enhancement issues.

17-53 Identify Inactive Inventory in the Product Master File

There are few things more frustrating than for someone to disposition obsolete
inventory, only to find that more inventory is then ordered, requiring additional
effort to disposition once again. This typically happens when the company’s
automatic reordering system notices that the inventory balance for this item has
dropped to zero, and sends a message to the purchasing department, asking for a
new purchase to bring the inventory balance up to some predetermined
minimum.

The obvious best practice is to reset the product’s activity flag in the product
master file to “obsolete,” “inactive,” or some similar code. This not only tells the
system to stop buying more inventory but also makes it impossible for the
purchasing staff to create a purchase order through the computer system. The
main problem is getting the person responsible for rendering inventory obsolete to
remember to reset the flag. This can be accomplished by noting the deactivation
step in bold on the written inventory deactivation procedure. However, if the
person doing this work ignores the procedure, it may be necessary to include a pop-up
reminder in the inventory software code that appears whenever an inventory balance
is set to zero. Another alternative is to modify the software to automatically alter the
product master file whenever an obsolescence code is used as part of a transaction to
write down inventory.

This chapter covered many best practices that improve the accuracy of the
inventory database and the speed with which transactions are recorded. By doing
so, the accounting department can be assured of much better accuracy in the
inventory valuation figures it records in the financial statements, which has the
related benefit of reducing any chance of error in the reported level of profitability.
Also, a number of best practices should shrink the amount of on-hand inventory,

which reduces the risk that inaccurate inventory information will have a significant
impact on reported financial results.

Unfortunately, the bulk of the best practices noted here are ones that must be
implemented and maintained by the warehouse and engineering departments,
which means that the controller cannot use any direct authority to ensure their
completion and use. Instead, this is a case where active persuasion is the key
component of the implementation effort on the part of the controller.

Payroll Best Practices”

The payroll function involves a large clerical workload occurring shortly before and
at the end of each pay period. For example, the typical payroll department collects
time cards, calculates the amount due, checks with supervisors regarding question-
able time cards, subtracts deductions of various kinds, cuts the checks, issues them,
and reconciles any differences when employees bring in their paychecks with
questions. After this frenetic time period, there is little for the department to
do—until the end of the next pay period arrives. This highly predictable surge
and drop in the payroll staffs workload can be a difficult one for a controller to
manage because it requires either large amounts of overtime by the payroll staff
during the heaviest work periods or else a redistribution of the accounting department
staff to assist in the effort from time to time. It is best to avoid the problems associated
with periodic strains on the staffing of the accounting department by examining each
step of the payroll process and streamlining it to reduce the overall workload. This
chapter contains a number of best practices that assist in doing so.

Another problem with the payroll function is that it is very error prone. For
example, it is easy to miss a pay raise, a vacation accrual, or a deduction. Every
time this happens, an employee will arrive with questions he or she wants answered
on the spot, which seriously impairs the efficiency of the department. In addition,
these problems create concern on the part of employees that their paychecks are not
being correctly calculated, which causes them to review pay data even more
carefully, which in turn brings even more employees to the payroll department,
requesting investigation of their real or imagined payroll problems. Thus, payroll
errors not only require valuable time to fix but also bring about a decline in
employee confidence in the accounting department. This chapter contains several
best practices that will reduce or eliminate many payroll errors.

Although this chapter reveals many techniques for reducing the workload and
error rate of the payroll staff, there are no methods for entirely sidestepping the
process, as is the case in the accounts payable area, so most of the best practices
described here are incremental in nature. Nonetheless, cost reductions can be
substantial. Data-entry errors, in particular, can be substantially reduced, along
with the cost of payment distribution. The cost of employee data maintenance will
also decline, as well as the cost of calculating pay. The net result of the changes

duration of implementation, which is of concern to those companies that may have
a short time and cost budget for improvements. The table is an effective approach
for quickly determining which projects to work on and which ones to avoid.

A danger of using Exhibit 18.1 to pick only the easiest best practices is that
these are primarily “quick hits” that will generally have a relatively small impact on


420 Payroll Best Practices

the overall level of efficiency of the payroll function. Accordingly, it is important
to insert changes requiring greater implementation effort and that have a corre-
spondingly higher payback. For example, adding direct deposit is an easy and
popular improvement, but a more fundamental change that requires much persua-
sion and more time to implement is reducing the number of payroll cycles.
Creating a mix of both easy and difficult projects is key to showing continuing
successes, while working toward greater levels of efficiency over the long term.

The reader should use Exhibit 18.1 to select the best practices listed in the
remainder of this chapter that most closely match specific company requirements.

18-1 Disallow Prepayments

Many employees do not have the monetary resources to see them through until the
next payday. Their solution is to request a pay advance, which is repaid at the time
of the next payday. It is a humane gesture on the part of the payroll manager to
comply with such requests, but it plays havoc with the efficiency of the payroll
department. Whenever such a request is made, the payroll staff must manually
calculate the taxes to take out of the payment, then manually cut a check and have it
signed. However, the inefficiencies are not yet over! In addition, the staff must
manually enter the pay advance in the computer system so that the amount is
deducted from the next paycheck. For larger advances, it may be necessary to make
deductions over several paychecks, which requires even more work. Clearly,
paycheck prepayments do not help the efficiency of the payroll department. This is
a particularly large problem in companies where a large proportion of the
employees are paid at or near the minimum wage, since these people may not
receive enough money to meet their needs.

The solution is to create a rule that no paycheck prepayments will be handed
out, which effectively ends the extra processing required of the payroll personnel.
The trouble with this rule is that a needy employee can usually present such a good
case for a pay advance that exceptions will be made, which grinds away at the rule
over time until it is completely ignored. Other managers will assist in tearing down
the rule by complaining that they will lose good employees if advances are not
provided to them. The best possible way to stand firm with the rule is for a
company to form an association with a local lending institution that specializes in
short-term loans. Then, if an employee requests an advance, he or she can be
directed to the lending institution, which will arrange for an interest-bearing loan to
the employee. When this arrangement exists, usually employees tighten their
budgets rather than pay the extra interest charged for use of the lender’s money.
This improves employee finances while increasing the processing efficiency of the
payroll staff. In short, this best practice involves two steps: prohibiting pay
advances, while at the same time arranging for alternative financing for employees.

18-2 Create Employee Self-Service for Payroll Changes 421

18-2 Create Employee Self-Service for Payroll Changes

Employees always have some sort of data change they want to make in the payroll
system, such as changes to their direct deposit, withholding, address, name, and marital
status information. The payroll staff must make all of these changes, as well as the
inevitable corrections caused by errors in data entry. For example, when an employee
first wants to set up direct deposit, she forwards this information to the payroll staff,
who inputs it into whatever payroll software is in use. If the employee forwards
incorrect information or it is incorrectly keypunched into the system, it is rejected and
must be dealt with again during the next payroll cycle. In addition, employees may
switch bank accounts or want to split deposits into multiple accounts—all of which
require additional work by the payroll staff. Depending on the number of employees,
these types of changes can represent a significant ongoing effort.

Payroll outsourcing companies now maintain employee self-service web sites
on behalf of their clients, who merely provide a link to these sites from their
intranet sites. Automated Data Processing (ADP) provides this service, and
estimates that a customized site can be operational in as little as 30 days. The
ADP site allows the payroll manager to upload a variety of employee-centric
documents, such as the employee manual, company phone directory, payroll
forms, and news releases. In addition to these basic functions, the site also allows
employees to access their pay statements and W-2 forms, view their earnings
history, check their remaining vacation time, see performance reviews, view their
401(k) plan balances, and verify their benefits elections. However, the range of
services offered varies considerably, as does the implementation time period.
Advanced features found on a few employee self-service systems allow staff to
request time off, swap shifts with other employees, submit work availability
periods, bid on shifts, and request overtime.

An alternative is to construct this type of portal for an in-house legacy payroll
system, but the programming effort required is so substantial that a company must
have a considerable number of employees to make it worthwhile. An alternative
would be to install a self-service module if a company uses commercial off-the-
shelf payroll software that already provides this functionality.

For example, employees can alter the bank routing and account numbers used
for the direct deposit of their pay into bank accounts, or change the amounts split
between deposits to their savings and checking accounts. They could also use this
approach to process requests for additional W-2 forms, or to download files
containing the employee manual or other relevant personnel information. Further,
they can register for company training classes, update emergency contact infor-
mation, and make time-off requests.

A cautionary note regarding employee self-service is that direct-deposit
prenotes should always be used when employees are allowed to enter their
own direct deposit information through a self-service portal. Some companies
have eliminated the prenote function when their own payroll staff enters direct-
deposit information, on the grounds that a data-entry professional will rarely make


422 Payroll Best Practices

data-entry mistakes. However, this is not the case for employees who enter
personal information, so prenoting should be used to ensure that account infor-
mation has been correctly entered.

18-3 Minimize Payroll Deductions

A company can offer a large number of benefits to its employees, many of which
require some sort of deduction from payroll. For example, a company can set up
deductions for employee medical, dental, life, and supplemental life insurance, as
well as cafeteria plan deductions for medical insurance or child care payments and
401(k) deductions. If there are many employees and many deduction types, the
payroll staff can be snowed under at payroll processing time by the volume of
changes continually occurring in this area. Also, whenever there is a change in the
underlying cost of insurance provided to the company, the company commonly
passes along some portion of these costs to the employees, resulting in a massive
updating of deductions for all employees who take that particular type of insurance.
This not only takes time away from other, more value-added accounting tasks but
also is subject to error so that adjustments must later be made to correct the errors,
which requires even more staff time.

There are several ways to address this problem. One is to eliminate the
employee-paid portion of some types of insurance. For example, if the cost to the
company for monthly dental insurance is $20 per employee, and the related
deduction is only $2 per person, management can elect to pay for the entire cost,
rather than burden the accounting staff with tracking this trivial sum. Another
alternative is to eliminate certain types of benefits, such as supplemental life
insurance or 401(k) loans, in order to eliminate the related deductions. Yet another
alternative is to create a policy that limits employee changes to any benefit plans, so
they can make only a small number of changes per year. This eliminates the
continual changing of deduction amounts in favor of just a few large bursts of
activity at prescheduled times during the year. A very good alternative is to create a
benefit package for all employees that requires a single deduction of the same
amount for everyone, or for a group (such as one deduction for single employees
and another for employees with families); employees can then pick and choose the
exact amount of each type of benefit they want within the boundaries of each
benefit package, without altering the amount of the underlying deduction. This last
alternative has the unique advantage of consolidating all deductions into a single
item, which is much simpler to administer. Any of these approaches to the problem
will reduce the number or timing of deduction changes, thereby reducing the
workload of the payroll staff.

18-4 Prohibit Deductions for Employee Purchases

Many companies allow their employees to use corporate discounts to buy products
through them. For example, a company may have obtained a large discount on
furniture from a supplier. Its employees buy at the discounted rate and then have
the deductions subtracted from their paychecks in convenient installments. Some
employees make excessive use of this benefit, purchasing all kinds of supplies
through the company; accordingly, it is common to see a very small minority of
employees making up the bulk of these purchases. The problem for the payroll staff
is that it must keep track of the total amount that each employee owes the company
and gradually deduct the amount owed from successive paychecks. If an employee
has multiple purchases, the payroll staff must constantly recalculate the amount to
be deducted. Depending on the number of employees taking advantage of
purchases through the company, this can have a measurable impact on the
efficiency of the payroll department.

The apparently easy solution is to prohibit purchases. By doing so, all the extra
paperwork associated with employee purchases is immediately swept away.
Though a good best practice for most companies to implement, this is one that
should first be cleared with senior management. The reason is that some employees
may be so accustomed to purchasing through the company that they will be rudely
surprised by the change, which may be something that management wants to avoid
(especially if valuable employees are impacted). Also, some companies have valid
reasons for allowing employee purchases. The most common situation is when
employees buy products that are meant to be used at work, such as work boots or
tools. In these cases, the reasons in favor of maintaining a purchasing program may
outweigh the reduced efficiency of the payroll department. A possible alternative
approach that will still eliminate payroll deductions is to still allow employee
purchases, but on condition that either the purchases are billed straight to them, or
that the employees pay the company in full as soon as the goods are received.

In short, eliminating employee purchases that require deductions is a simple
best practice to implement, though there are employee relations issues that may
keep it from being implemented.

18-5 Post Forms on an Intranet Site

Employees frequently come to the accounting department to ask for any of the
variety of forms required for changes to their payroll status, such as the IRS’s W-4
form, address changes, cafeteria plan sign-up or change forms, and so on. These
constant interruptions interfere with the orderly flow of accounting work, espe-
cially when the department runs out of a form and must scramble to replenish its
supplies.


424 Payroll Best Practices

This problem is neatly solved by converting all forms to Adobe Acrobat’s
PDF format and posting them on a company intranet site for downloading by all
employees. By using this approach, no one ever has to approach the accounting
staff for the latest copy of a form. Also, employees can download the required form
from anywhere, rather than waiting until they are near the accounting location to
physically pick one up. Further, the accounting staff can regularly update the PDF
forms on the intranet site, so there is no risk of someone’s using an old and
outmoded form.

Converting a regular form to PDF format is simple. First, purchase the Acrobat
software from Adobe’s web site and install it. Then access a form in whatever
software package it was originally constructed, and print it in PDF format, which
will now appear on the list of printers. There are no other steps—your PDF format
is complete! The IRS also uses the PDF format for its forms, which can be
downloaded from the www.irs.gov site and posted to the company intranet site.
Some software packages contain a PDF conversion feature, so there is no need to
buy the Acrobat software.

18-6 Avoid Job Costing through the Payroll System

Some controllers have elaborate cost accounting systems set up that accumulate
a variety of costs from many sources, sometimes to be used for activity-based
costing and, more frequently, for job costing. One of these costs is labor, which
is sometimes accumulated through the payroll system. When this is done,
employees use lengthy time cards where they record the time spent on many
activities during the day, resulting in vastly longer payroll records than would
otherwise be the case. This is a problem when the payroll staff is asked to sort
through and add up all of the job-costing records, since this increases the
workload of the payroll personnel by an order of magnitude. In addition, the
payroll staff may be asked to enter the job-costing information that it has just
compiled into the job-costing database, which is yet another task that gets in the
way of processing the payroll.

The solution is to not allow job costing to be merged into the payroll function,
thereby allowing the payroll staff to vastly reduce the amount of work it must
complete, as well as shrink the number of opportunities for calculation errors.
However, this step may meet with opposition from those people who need the job-
costing records. There are several ways to avoid conflict over the issue. One is to
analyze who is charging time to various projects or activities and see if the
proportions of time charged vary significantly over time; if they do not, there is no
reason to continue tracking job-costing information for hours worked. Another
possibility is to split the functions so the payroll staff collects its payroll data
independently of job-costing data collection, which can be handled by someone


18-7 Use Computerized Time Clocks 425

else. Either possibility will keep the job-costing function from interfering with the
orderly collection of payroll information.

Cost: SF Installation time:

18-7 Use Computerized Time Clocks

The single most labor-intensive task in the payroll area is calculating hours worked
for hourly employees. To do so, an accounting clerk must collect all the employee
time cards for the most recently completed payroll period, manually add up the
hours listed on the cards, and research missing hours with supervisors. This is a
lengthy process and usually has a very high error rate, due to the large percentage
of missing start or stop times on most time cards. The errors are usually found by
employees as soon as they are paid, resulting in a loud and (sometimes) boisterous
visit to the payroll department, demanding an immediate adjustment to the paid
amount with a manual paycheck.

One solution is to install a computerized time clock. This is a clock that
requires an employee to “swipe” an employee-specific plastic card through the
clock. The card is encoded with an employee-identifying number, using either a
bar code or a magnetic stripe. Once the swipe occurs, the clock automatically stores
the date and time and downloads this data upon request to the payroll department’s
computer, where special software automatically calculates hours worked and
highlights any problems for additional research (such as missed swipes). Many
such clocks can be installed throughout a large facility, or at outlying locations, so
that employees can conveniently record their time, no matter where they may be.
The more advanced clocks also track the time periods when employees are
supposed to arrive and leave, and require a supervisor’s password for card swipes
outside of that time period—this feature allows for greater control over employee
work hours. Many of these systems also issue absence reports so that supervisors
can easily tell who has not shown up for work. Thus, an automated time clock
eliminates much low-end clerical work, while at the same time providing new
management tools for supervisors.

Before purchasing a bar-coded time clock, it is important to recognize its
limitations, of which the most important is cost. This clock costs up to $2,000. In
addition, outlying time clocks that must download their information to a computer at
a distant location require their own phone lines, which represents an additional
monthly payment to the phone company. There may also be a fee for using the
software on the central computer that summarizes all the incoming payroll informa-
tion. Given these costs, it is most common for bar-coded time clocks to be used only
where there are so many hourly employees in a company that there is a significant
time savings in the payroll department resulting from their installation.

A key flaw of the computerized time clock is that employees can use one
another’s cards to clock themselves in, resulting in payments for time worked


426 Payroll Best Practices

to employees who may not have even been on the premises. To avoid this
problem, you can install a webcam next to the clock that snaps an image for
every card swipe made and stores it for easy access by the payroll staff. The
information can be stored for a few weeks in this manner until there is no need
for the information, and then written over. By using this approach, employees
will be much less inclined to clock in or out for their buddies, while the payroll
staff will have ready evidence of improper card swipes. The main problem with
this approach is the difficulty of linking information from the card swipe to the
image created by the camera, so you can tell what information was entered into
the system by each person.

Cost: FF Installation time:

18-8 Use Exception Time Reporting

Most employees work a standard 40-hour week and perform the same tasks over
and over again, week after week. However, the typical time-tracking system
requires them to complete a timesheet every week. Since they see no point in
submitting the same information every week, employees continually forget to
submit timesheets on a timely basis, which means that the payroll staff has
to spend time contacting them with reminders. Thus, a considerable amount of
time is wasted by everyone to submit the same timekeeping information
every week.

In situations where hours worked are essentially the same on an ongoing basis,
a good alternative is to create a default time record in the timekeeping system, and
only require employees to change it if they have nonstandard hours to report, such
as overtime or a short workweek. A lesser alternative for companies using a
computer-based timekeeping system is to install a single button on-screen that
employees can press if they simply want to copy forward their timesheet from the
preceding week. Yet another variation applicable to salaried employees is for them
to only submit a timesheet when they are recording paid time off, such as vacation,
sick, jury duty, or military time.

This solution works less well when employees are charging their time to
specific jobs that change frequently. If these are billable jobs for which time
recording must be accurate, then there is little opportunity to use this best practice.
However, if the reason for charging to jobs is for internal cost accounting purposes
that is not required by an external entity, it is possible that the cost accounting staff
can be convinced to reduce or eliminate their time-tracking requirements on the
grounds that the labor component of most jobs in the production area is only a
small component of the total cost, and that the cost of time tracking is therefore not
worth the resulting additional cost information.

18-10 Reduce the Number of Pay Codes 427

18-9 Install Automated Timesheet Reminders

The payroll staff may spend a considerable amount of time reminding employees
to complete their timesheets, so they can be paid on time. This is an especially
difficult problem when employees are traveling a great deal and are therefore
difficult to reach.

If a company uses a computer-based timekeeping system, the computer
can automatically determine when timesheets have not been submitted, and
automatically issue an e-mail notice to each laggard employee. It can also
continue to do this on a repetitive basis and issue a notice to an employee’s
supervisor if the timesheet has not been submitted within a certain number of
notices.

This solution does not work well if some employees either do not have regular
access to e-mail or do not use it, though it will still probably reduce the amount of
follow-up contacts that the payroll staff must make. Also, this approach requires
some custom programming work to achieve, as well as some tracking mechanism
for determining who is a person’s direct supervisor (if reminder e-mails are to be
sent to supervisors as well).

Cost: SF SF Installation time:

18-10 Reduce the Number of Pay Codes

Companies sometimes require their employees to select from a wide array of
pay codes when recording their time in a payroll system. From an administrative
perspective, these codes can include training, jury duty, holidays, vacation,
sick time, bereavement leave, and family leave. In the manufacturing area, the
number of codes can be overwhelming, including codes for such activities
as receiving, putaway, picking, cross-docking, case breakdown, and cycle-
counting—and that’s just the warehouse! The payroll staff is usually called on to
monitor charges to these pay codes and make adjustments where necessary.

The trouble with having a broad range of pay codes is that the resulting data
does not normally yield any improvement in company operations. Instead, once
time is initially compiled within each pay code, the cost accountant usually finds
that the proportions of time spent on each activity do not change very much over
time. Thus, the extra labor required to charge time to them and correct a multitude
of pay codes only affirms that activities are usually steady-state and therefore do
not require much monitoring.

A better approach is to have as many employees as possible charge their time
to a single pay code that needs to be altered only on an exception basis (see best
practice 18-8, “Use Exception Time Reporting”). When the cost accounting staff
needs additional information about specific activities, it can conduct a periodic


428 Payroll Best Practices

review and collect the information itself, rather than requiring the payroll depart-
ment to collect this information for it.

Cost: SF Installation time: €3

18-11 Use Biometric Time Clocks

The computerized time clocks noted in a previous best practice represent a
wonderful improvement in the speed and accuracy with which employee time
data can be collected. However, it suffers from an integrity flaw—that employees can
use each other’s badges to enter and exit from the payroll system. This means that
some employees may be paid for hours when they were never really on-site at all.

An alternative is the biometric time clock. It requires an employee to place
his or her hand on a sensor, which matches its size and shape to the dimensions
already recorded for that person in a central database. The time entered into the
terminal will then be recorded against the payroll file of the person whose hand
was just measured. Thus, only employees who are on-site can have payroll hours
credited to them. These systems have a secondary benefit, which is that no one
needs an employee badge or pass key; these tend to be lost or damaged over
time, and so represent a minor headache for the accounting or human resources
staffs, who must track them. In a biometric monitoring environment, all an
employee needs is a hand.

An objection sometimes raised by employees about biometric time clocks
is that there may be a risk of employees passing bacteria to each other, since
everyone is touching the same sensor pad on the clock. The clock manufacturers
reduce the risk of bacteria transmission by incorporating antimicrobial materials
into the sensor pad that reduce bacteria levels. To further allay fears about this issue,
have the janitorial staff include biometric clock disinfecting in its standard cleaning
list. Also, make hand sanitizers available near each clock.

18-12 Track Time with Mobile Phones

When employees are occupied with off-site service jobs, such as copier repair,
security monitoring, or landscaping work, it is quite difficult to track the exact
amount of time they spend on each job. Instead, they tend to wait until they are
back in the office and then jot down their billable time from memory. Also, if they
are paid based on their billable hours, this introduces a great deal of uncertainty
into the determination of their payroll hours. The use of a Web-based timekeeping
system is not a good solution, since it requires Web access and a computer, which
are not always available to this type of employee.


18-14 Issue Electronic W-2 Forms to Employees 429

The solution is to give employees the option to download a timekeeping app to
their smartphones. They can then record their time “on the fly” and e-mail the
results to the payroll department at the end of each day. This information will need
to be manually transferred into the payroll system, but at least provides a method
for some employees to submit their hours worked in a timely manner. It may be
necessary to pay for the monthly smartphone data plans used by employees, to
convince them to use a timekeeping app.

By using this approach, employees no longer have to manually complete
timesheets, while the payroll staff can summarize payroll data more rapidly and the
billing staff can issue invoices to customers shortly after a job has been completed
in the field.

18-13 Install Additional Time Clocks

When a company elects to install electronic time clocks, as advocated previously in
this chapter, it may make the mistake of installing too few clocks because of the high
cost of the equipment. This creates two problems. First, employees may line up in
front of each clock during check-out times. In anticipation of waiting in the line,
employees may leave their workstations slightly early. In addition, if a time clock is
positioned too far away from their workstations, they may also stop working early in
order to be in front of the nearest time clock at check-out time. Although these issues
may only be a few minutes per person, it becomes a much larger issue when
multiplied by many employees, over all of the business days in a year.

The obvious solution is to add more time clocks. However, this does not
necessarily call for the profligate purchase and installation of a vast quantity of
additional clocks. The original decision not to install more clocks may have been
driven by such problems as not having electrical power in a distant location, not
wanting to install a clock outdoors, or not wanting to string network cable to a
prospective clock location. These issues may be more important than the price of a
time clock. Consequently, adding time clocks involves a close review of the total
cost of installation and will probably result in a gradual rollout, as management
evaluates how the cost of each installation is offset by the savings in labor for those
people who use the clock.

A large company can experience some difficulty in issuing W-2 forms to its

distribution can also be quite expensive, especially if the employer wants proof of
receipt, which calls for the use of more expensive overnight delivery services. This
problem can be avoided by issuing electronic W-2 forms to employees, thereby
avoiding all related postage costs.

The IRS has issued specific regulations for the use of electronic W-2 forms.
First, employees must give their consent to the receipt of an electronic W-2 form,
and do so electronically, thereby showing proof that they are capable of receiving
the electronic format in which the W-2 form will be sent. Second, the W-2 forms
must contain all standard information that would normally be found on a paper
W-2 form. Third, employees must be notified that the forms have been posted on a
web site for their access, and give them instructions on how to access the
information. Finally, the access must be maintained through October 15 of the
year following the calendar year to which they relate.

These regulations are not difficult to meet, and the use of a central web site for
storage of the information also allows the employer to determine precisely which
W-2 forms have been accessed. However, it is likely that some employees who
either have minimal access to computers or who are not computer literate will not
access their W-2 forms in this manner, requiring a last-minute distribution of W-2
forms to anyone who has not accessed their electronic copies. Also, paper-based
W-2 forms must still be issued to any employees who left the company prior to the
end of the calendar year. Thus, this best practice will likely result in only a partial
electronic distribution of W-2 forms.

18-15 Transfer Payroll to Debit Cards

Some companies employ people who, for whatever reason, either are unable to set
up personal bank accounts or do not choose to. In these cases, they must take their
paychecks to a check-cashing service, which charges them a high fee to convert the
check into cash. Also, employees will be carrying large amounts of cash just after
cashing their checks, which increases their risk of theft. They also run the risk of
losing their paychecks prior to cashing them. Thus, the lack of a bank account
poses serious problems for a company’s employees.

A good solution to this problem is to set up a payroll debit card for any
employees requesting one, and then shift payroll funds directly into the card.
This allows employees to pull any amount of cash they need from an automated
teller machine (ATM), rather than the entire amount at one time from a check-
cashing service. The card can also be used like a credit card, so there is little
need to make purchases with cash. Further, the fee to convert to cash at an
ATM is much lower than the fee charged by a check-cashing service. There is
also less risk of theft through the card, since it is protected by a personal
identification number (PIN). Employees will also receive a monthly statement


18-15 Transfer Payroll to Debit Cards 431

showing their account activity, which they can use to get a better idea of their
spending habits.

Payroll cards, also called paycards, are superior to direct deposit in the
following respects:

¢ First payment is electronic. When paying an employee through direct
deposit, the first payment to a new employee is with a check, since the
bank wants to prenote the first direct deposit transaction. This is not the case
for a payroll card, where the first payment can be issued electronically.

¢ Data collection. Direct deposit requires the employer to collect bank routing
and account number information from employees, which may be incorrect or
difficult to obtain. This is not needed for payroll cards, since the employer
creates each account.

¢ Account lockdown. Employees sometimes shut down their bank accounts
and forget to inform the company that direct-deposit payments must now be
sent to a new location. Since the employer controls the payroll card account,
employees cannot shut down the account.

¢ Termination pay. Terminated employees can be paid within one day through
a payroll card, and there is no need for them to come back to the office to pick
up a final check.

¢ Information security. Unlike direct deposit, an employer does not need to
retain personal banking information for payroll cards, since it is setting up all
accounts.

¢ Additional cards. Some card providers will issue extra payroll cards to other
family members, which allows them to withdraw funds in other cities; this
keeps the wage earner from paying wire transfer fees to send money to other
family members.

¢ Pay routing. Some card providers now allow card users to automatically route
incoming funds to personal bank accounts, though there is a one-day delay in
the funds transfer.

Here are some additional considerations regarding the setup of a payroll debit
card program:

¢ Employees should not have to pay a withdrawal fee when they extract funds
from an ATM (in some states, it is illegal to require employees to pay such a
fee as part of their payroll payments). Accordingly, either have the company
pay the ATM fee or have the paycard supplier specify in its contract which
ATMs will offer free services to employees. It is also possible to set up an
on-site company-owned ATM, which ensures that ATM fees will be free.

¢ Paycard issuers can impose a blizzard of fees, such as fees for an excessive
number of paycard transactions, card replacements, a “load fee” (when a card


432 Payroll Best Practices

is funded), and a monthly fee. First, be sure that none of these fees are charged
to employees, only the company. Second, write limitations into the contract on
increases in these fees, as well as the exclusion of as-yet-unspecified fees.
Also, it is helpful to model the full cost of all fees, using reasonable estimates
of card usage, in order to determine which paycard program is the most
economical.

¢ Some paycard issuers are not banks, so funds issued to paycards maintained
by them could be lost if the issuer goes out of business. Instead, provide your
employees with some extra security by using only paycards issued by a bank,
which carries FDIC insurance on funds deposited with it.

¢ The way to access cash from a payroll debit card is to obtain it through an
ATM, but since ATMs issue cash only in denominations of $20, this presents a
problem for card balances of less than $20. One option is to see if the provider
will issue a check to employees for such residual balances, or if convenience
checks are provided to employees so they can extract this balance themselves.

18-16 Use Direct Deposit

A major task for the payroll staff is to issue paychecks to employees. This task can
be subdivided into several subsidiary steps. First, the checks must be printed—
though it seems easy, it is all too common for the check run to fail, resulting in the
manual cancellation of the first batch of checks, followed by a new print run. Next,
the checks must be signed by an authorized check signer, who may have questions
about payment amounts, which may require additional investigation. After that, the
checks must be stuffed into envelopes and then sorted by supervisor (since
supervisors generally hand out checks to their employees). The checks are then
distributed, usually with the exception of a few checks that will be held for those
employees who are not currently on-site for later pickup. Finally, the person in
charge of the bank reconciliation must track those checks that have not been cashed
and follow up with employees to get them to cash their checks—there are usually a
few employees who prefer to cash checks only when they need the money,
surprising though this may seem. In short, there are a startlingly large number of
steps involved in issuing payroll checks to employees. How can you eliminate this
work?

The solution is to pay by direct deposit. This best practice involves issuing
payments directly to employee bank accounts. Besides avoiding some of the steps
involved with issuing paychecks, it carries the additional advantage of putting
money in employee bank accounts at once so that those employees who are off-site
on payday do not worry about how they will receive their money—it will appear in
their checking accounts automatically, with no effort on their part.


18-16 Use Direct Deposit 433

Implementing direct deposit can be somewhat more difficult than you may first
realize. It requires an ability to transfer payment information to the company’s bank
in the correct direct-deposit format, which the bank uses to shift money to employee
bank accounts. This information transfer can be accomplished either by purchasing
an add-on to a company’s in-house payroll software or by paying extra to a payroll
outsourcing company to provide the service; either way, there is an expense
associated with starting up the service. Also, it can be difficult to get all employees
to switch over to direct deposit. Though the benefits to employees may seem obvious,
there will be a large proportion of employees who prefer to cash their own checks, or
who do not possess bank accounts. To get around this problem, a company can either
force all employees to accept direct deposit, or only do so with new employees, with
existing employees being allowed to still take paper checks. If employees are forced
to accept direct deposit, the company can make the issue less onerous by working
with a local bank to provide a free bank account to each employee. Also, there will be
the inevitable start-up problems for the first few weeks, resulting in some direct
deposits not going through to employees on time. These issues mean that it may take
quite some time to convert a large proportion of employee payments over to direct
deposit. To monitor progress, consider creating a direct-deposit usage percentage
and including it in the standard monthly reporting package. This keeps the issue in
front of management. All of these issues make implementing direct deposit
somewhat more difficult and expensive than would first appear to be the case.

Another issue with direct deposit is prenotification. This is the prior validation
of an employee’s bank account information before an actual payroll payment is
made into that person’s account, to see if there are any errors in the account
information. Engaging in the prenotification process delays the implementation of
direct deposit by one pay period, which means that a new employee always
receives one paycheck before switching to direct deposit. A company can sometimes
choose not to prenote, which eliminates the employee waiting period but which also
increases the possibility that a payment will be rejected. It is possible to reduce the
risk of a rejection by other means than prenotification, such as by contacting an
employee’s bank directly to verify account information.

Besides implementation issues, there are a few other problems to consider
before using direct deposit. One is the fee charged by the bank or payroll service to
do it—a common charge is $1 to make a direct deposit to each employee’s account,
which can add up if there are many employees and frequent pay periods (e.g., once
a week). Also, most companies find that they end up with a dual system—some
employees take direct deposit and some go with paper checks—so that they have a
more complicated system with two forms of payment. However, do not let all these
problems shoot down an initiative to use direct deposit. If you follow through on it
properly, then most or all employees can still be converted to it over the long term.
Despite its disadvantages, direct deposit can be a clear advantage to both the
accounting department and employees, if properly implemented.

434 Payroll Best Practices

18-17 Automate Vacation Accruals

A topic that is of considerable interest to employees is how much vacation time
they have left. In most companies, this information is kept manually by the payroll
staff, so employees troop down to the payroll department once a month (and more
frequently in the prime summer vacation months!) to see how much vacation time
they have left to use. When employees are constantly coming in to ascertain this
information, it is a major interruption to the payroll staff, because it happens at all
times of the day, never allowing them to settle down into a comfortable work
routine.

A simple solution is to include the vacation accrual in employee paychecks.
The information appears on the payroll stub, and shows the annual amount of
accrued vacation, net of any used time. By feeding this information to employees
in every paycheck, there is no need for them to inquire about it in the payroll office,
eliminating a major hindrance. However, there are several points to consider before
automating vacation accruals. The first one is that the payroll system must be
equipped with a vacation accrual calculation option. If not, the software must
be modified with custom programming to allow for the calculation and presenta-
tion of this information, which may cost more to implement than the projected
efficiency savings. Another problem is that the accrual system must be set up
properly for each employee when it is originally installed. This start-up problem is
caused by having employees with different numbers of days of vacation allowed
per year, as well as some with carryover vacation from the previous year. If this
information is not accurately reflected in the automated vacation accrual system
when it is implemented, employees will hasten to the payroll area to correct this
problem at once. Another issue is that the accruals must be adjusted over time to
reflect changes. For example, an employee may switch from two to three weeks of
allowed vacation at the fifth anniversary of his or her hiring. The payroll
department must have a schedule of when this person’s vacation accrual amount
changes to the three-week level, or the employee will come in and complain about
it. If these problems can be overcome, using vacation accruals becomes a relatively
simple means of improving the efficiency of the payroll department.

18-18 Consolidate Payroll Systems

A company that grows by acquisition is likely to have a number of payroll
systems—one for each company that it has acquired. This situation may also arise
for highly decentralized companies that allow each company location to set up its
own payroll system. Though this approach does allow each location to process
payroll in accordance with its own rules and payment periods, while also allowing
for local maintenance of employee records, there are several serious problems that


18-19 Create a Payroll Call Center for Employees 435

can be solved by the consolidation of all these systems into a single, centralized
payroll system.

One problem with having many payroll systems is that employee payroll
records cannot be shifted through a company when an employee is transferred to a
new location. Instead, the employee is listed as having been terminated in the
payroll system of the location that he or she is leaving and is then listed as a new
hire in the payroll system of the new location. By constantly reentering an
employee as a new hire, it is impossible to track the dates and amounts of pay
raises; the same problem arises for the human resources staff, who cannot track
eligibility dates for medical insurance or vesting periods for pension plans. In
addition, every time employee data is reentered into a different payroll system,
there is a risk of data inaccuracies that may result in such embarrassments as wrong
pay rates or mailing checks to the wrong address. Also, a company cannot easily
group data for companywide payroll reporting purposes. Finally, if an employee
switches among multiple payroll systems, there is a chance that the corporate entity
as a whole will pay an excessive amount of payroll taxes. For all these reasons, it is
common practice to consolidate payroll systems into a single, centralized location
that operates with a single payroll database.

Before embarking on such a consolidation, you should consider the costs of
implementation. One is that a consolidation of many payroll systems may require
an expensive new software package that runs on a large computer, which entails
extra capital and software maintenance costs. In addition, there is probably a
significant cost associated with converting the data from the disparate databases
into the new consolidated one. In addition, there may be extra time needed to test
the tax rates for all company locations, in order to avoid penalties for improper tax
withholdings and submissions. Finally, the timing of the implementation is of
some importance. Many companies prefer to make the conversion on the first day
of the new year so there is no need to enter detailed pay information into the system
for the prior year to issue year-end payroll tax reports to the government. The cost
of consolidating payroll systems is considerable and must be carefully analyzed
before the decision to convert is reached.

Switching from many payroll systems to a single one is an excellent best practice
to implement, with many long-term benefits. However, due to the conversion cost, it
is important to weigh the costs and benefits of the project and to insert the project into
a company’s capital budget only when the funds are definitely available.

18-19 Create a Payroll Call Center for Employees

When employees have payroll questions, they typically call anyone they know in
the payroll department, or whoever is listed in the company directory. In either
case, this can cause disruption for payroll people who may be trying to meet


436 Payroll Best Practices

deadlines for other tasks. A possible solution is to create a call center that is
expressly targeted at resolving employee payroll issues.

Having a payroll call center does not mean that a specific group of employees
are simply given new titles as customer service representatives—far from it. A true
call center requires the following items:

¢ Advanced training and senior personnel. If a call center is staffed with new
employees who have minimal knowledge of payroll systems, then callers will
quickly stop using the call center. Instead, call center employees should have
considerable prior payroll experience and be subjected to detailed training on
topics that callers are most likely to bring up. Having such a high-quality team
gives callers confidence that their questions will be correctly answered, which
increases employee usage of the call center.

¢ Metrics tracking. A system should track the total handling time required to
resolve an employee request, as well as the percentage of requests that are
resolved on the first call. These two metrics are used to determine the efficiency
(handling time) and effectiveness (first call resolution) of the call center.

¢ Call-routing software. For high-volume call centers, a call-routing system
places callers in a queue and routes them to the first available call center
representative.

¢ Case tracking. If a call cannot be resolved on the first contact, then a case-
tracking system should be used to describe the issue and assign a tracking
number to it.

¢ Workflow management. This system is tied to the case-tracking system, and
monitors the progress of resolution of all open cases. It should also escalate to
a manager any cases that have not been resolved within a predetermined time
period.

To set up this best practice, it may be necessary to remove payroll phone
numbers from the company directory in favor of a single phone number for the call
center. This will route callers away from payroll staff, which no longer deals with
employee support issues.

This solution may appear to be overkill for a smaller company. If so, consider
adding additional functionality to the call center so that it also handles additional
requests for information. For example, the human resources department could
combine with the payroll department to support a call center that also provides
benefits-related information. Another option is an extremely small call center of
one person, with a designated back-up person. All of the software used in a larger
call center can still be used so that callers are put in a queue and metrics collected
on call durations, topics addressed, and resolutions.

18-21 Link Payroll Changes to Employee Events 437

18-20 Eliminate Personal Leave Days

A common task for the payroll staff is to either manually or automatically track the
vacation time employees earn and use. Depending on the level of automation, this
task can require some portion of staff time every week on an ongoing basis. Some
companies then take the additional step of accruing and tracking the usage of
personal leave days, which are essentially the same thing as vacation time, but
tracked under a different name. By having both vacation and personal leave days,
the payroll staff is reduced to tracking data in both categories, which doubles the
work required to simply track vacation time.

A reasonable, and easily implemented, best practice is to convert personal
leave days into vacation days and eliminate the extra category of time off. By doing
so, the payroll staff can cut in half the time it devotes to analyzing employee
vacation time. The only resistance to this change usually comes from the human
resources department, which likes to offer a variety of benefits to match those other
companies offer; for example, if a competitor offers personal leave days, then so
should the company. Though only a matter of semantics, this can cause a problem
when implementing the simpler system.

18-21 Link Payroll Changes to Employee Events

There are many payroll changes that must be made when certain events occur in an
employee file. Many of these changes are never made, because either the payroll
staff is so busy with the standard, daily processing of information that it has no time
to address them or the payroll staff does not possess enough knowledge to link the
payroll changes to the employee events. For example, when an employee is
married, this should trigger a change in that person’s W-4 form, so the amount of
taxes withheld will reflect those for a married person. Automation can create many
of these linkages. Here are some examples:

¢ As soon as an employee reaches the age of 55, the system issues a notification
to the pension manager to calculate the person’s potential pension, while also
notifying the employee of his or her pension eligibility. These notifications
can be by letter, but a linkage between the payroll system and the email system
would result in more immediate notification.

¢ As soon as an employee has been with a company for 90 days, his or her
period of probation has been completed. The system should then automati-
cally include the employee in the company’s dental, medical, and disability
plans, and include deductions for these amounts in the person’s paycheck.
Similarly, the system can automatically enroll the employee in the company’s
401(k) plan and enter the deductions in the payroll system. Since these pay


438 Payroll Best Practices

changes should not be a surprise to the employee, the system should also
generate a message to the employee, detailing the changes made and their net
payroll impact.

¢ When acompany is informed of an employee’s marriage, the computer system
generates a notice to the employee that a new W-4 form should be filled out,
while also sending a new benefit enrollment form, in case the employee
wishes to add benefits for the spouse or any children. Finally, a notification
message can ask the employee if he or she wants to change the beneficiary’s
name on the pension plan to that of the spouse.

¢ When an employee notifies the company of an address change, the system
automatically notifies all related payroll and benefit suppliers of the change,
such as the 401(k) plan administrator and health insurance provider.

¢ When a new employee is hired, the system sends a message to the purchasing
department, asking that business cards be ordered for the employee. Another
message goes to the information systems department, requesting that the
appropriate levels of system security be set up for the new hire. Yet another
message goes to the training department, asking that a training plan be set up
for the new employee.

Many of these workflow features are available on high-end accounting and
human resources software packages. However, this software costs more than a
million dollars in most cases, and so is well beyond the purchasing capability of
many smaller companies. An alternative is to customize an existing software
package to include these features, but the work required will be expensive.
Accordingly, these changes should be contemplated only if there are many
employees, since this would result in a sufficient volume of savings to justify
the added expense.

18-22 Install Manager Self-Service

A considerable amount of payroll staff time is occupied by the setup and deletion
of employees from the payroll database, as well as by the recording of payroll
events, such as employee pay raises, transfers, and employee leave situations.
Usually, a local manager fills out paperwork pertaining to these events and
forwards it to the payroll department, which keypunches the information into
the payroll system. This workflow can result in lost or delayed paperwork as well
as incorrect data entry. If the events being entered pertain to employee pay raises,
an error is also likely to result in boisterous contacts by the affected employee.

An elegant solution is to create an intranet portal through which local
managers can enter all of this information themselves, with no need for any


18-22 Install Manager Self-Service 439

data entry by the payroll staff. Since most managers have access to a computer
terminal already, there is generally no need to acquire additional computer
hardware.

The efficiency improvement resulting from this best practice for the payroll
staff is obvious. However, in order to prevent them from immediately converting to
error-correction mode for all the errors being made by local managers through the
new payroll intranet site, there are a number of enhancements to consider when
building the site:

¢ Install data limit checkers. Managers may inadvertently enter incorrect
information that is patently false, such as a $1 million salary, by not entering a
decimal place. The data-entry system can include a number of data limit checkers
that will automatically reject data unless they fall within a tight parameter range.

¢ Require transaction-specific approvals. If a manager wants to give an
employee an inordinately large pay raise, the system should bring this raise to
the attention of the payroll staff or an upper-level manager, who must approve
it before the payroll database is updated with the new information.

¢ Issue warnings to affected departments. When a manager enters an
employee termination into the computer system, this should trigger a message
to the human resources department, who may want to conduct an exit
interview. Similarly, the 401(k) plan administrator needs to know about
the termination in order to send plan termination documents to the former
employee; the same goes for the health plan administrator, who must mail out
a packet of COBRA information. A number of similar notifications are needed
at the point of initial hire.

Thus, the manager data-entry system is not really a simple interface. It must
review input data, issue notifications and warnings, and generally take over the role
of an experienced payroll clerk to ensure that employee transition data is correctly
handled throughout the company.

A manager self-service system can go beyond the more basic data-entry tasks
just noted. In addition, the system can also report to a manager which staff
members are currently clocked in or out, and can also send alerts when an
employee comes in late or leaves early, or when employee work hours violate
a predetermined set of disciplinary criteria. It may also have reporting functions,
such as an analysis of absentee trends by employee. An advanced system may also
track leave requests and eligibility under the Family and Medical Leave Act.

Given the complexity of the manager self-service system, it is generally best to
roll out only one function at a time not only to ensure that sufficient system
checking is conducted but also to give managers sufficient time to train on each
function and become used to its mode of operation.

440 Payroll Best Practices

18-23 Link the 401(k) Plan to the Payroll System

A common activity for the payroll staff is to take the 401(k) deduction information
from the payroll records as soon as each payroll cycle is completed, enter it into a
separate database for 401(k) deductions, copy this information onto a compact
disc, and send it to the company’s 401(k) administration supplier, who uses it to
determine the investment levels of all employees, as well as for discrimination
testing. This can be a lengthy data-entry process if there are many employees, and
it is certainly not a value-added activity when the core task is simply moving data
from one database to another one.

The best way to avoid retyping 401(k) payroll deductions is to link the payroll
system directly into a 401(k) plan. This is done by outsourcing the payroll
processing function to a supplier that also offers a 401(k) plan. A good example
of this is ADP, which offers linkages to a number of well-known mutual funds
through its payroll system. When a company uses ADP’s payroll and 401(k)
services, a payroll department can record a 401(k) payroll deduction for an
employee just once and ADP will then take the deduction and automatically
move it into a 401(k) fund, with no additional bookkeeping required from the
payroll staff. For those companies with many employees, this can represent a
significant reduction in the workload of the payroll staff.

There are two problems with this best practice. One is that a company must
first outsource its payroll function to a supplier that offers 401(k) administration
services, which the company controller may not be willing to do (see best practice
18-30, “Outsource the Payroll Function,” later in this chapter). The second
problem is converting to the new 401(k) plan. To do so, all employees in the
old plan must be moved to the new plan. The associated paperwork may be great
enough to not make the transition worthwhile; also, the old 401(k) administrator
may require a separation fee if the company is terminating its services inside of a
minimum time interval, which may involve a small penalty payment. These issues
should be considered before switching to a centralized payroll and 401(k)
processing system.

18-24 Link the Payroll and Human Resources Databases

The payroll database shares many data elements with the human resources
database. Unfortunately, these two databases are usually maintained by different
departments—accounting for the first and human resources for the second.
Consequently, any employee who makes a change to one database, such as an
address field in the payroll system, must then contact the human resources
department to have the same information entered again for other purposes,
such as benefits administration or a pension plan. Thus, there is an obvious


18-25 Minimize Payroll Cycles 441

inefficiency for the employee who must go to two departments for changes, while
the accounting and human resources staffs also duplicate each other’s data-entry
efforts.

The obvious best practice here is to tie the two databases together. This can be
done by purchasing a software package that automatically consolidates the two
databases into a single one, but the considerable cost of buying and implementing
an entirely new software package will grossly exceed the cost savings obtained
by consolidating the data. A less costly approach is to create an interface between
the two systems that automatically stores changes made to each database and
updates the other one as a daily batch program. Creating this interface can still be
expensive, since it involves a reasonable amount of customized programming
work. Consequently, consolidating the payroll and human resources databases is
an expensive proposition and is usually done only when both computer systems are
being brought together for more reasons than a simple reduction in data-entry
work,

18-25 Minimize Payroll Cycles

Many payroll departments are fully occupied with processing some kind of payroll
every week and possibly even several times in one week. This situation arises when
different groups of employees are paid for different time periods. For example,
hourly employees may be paid every week, whereas salaried employees may be
paid twice a month. In addition, the employees of acquired companies may be paid
in accordance with the pay periods that were in existence prior to their acquisition.
Processing multiple payroll cycles eats up most of the free time of the payroll staff,
leaving it with little room for cleaning up paperwork or researching improvements
to its basic operations.

An excellent solution is to consolidate the payroll cycles into a single,
companywide cycle. By doing so, the payroll staff no longer have to spend extra
time on additional payroll processing, nor do they have to worry about the different
pay rules that may apply to each processing period—everyone is treated exactly the
same. To make payroll processing even more efficient, it is useful to lengthen
the payroll cycles. For example, a payroll department that processes weekly payrolls
must run the payroll 52 times a year, whereas one that processes monthly
payrolls only does so 12 times a year, which eliminates 75 percent of the
processing that the first department must handle. These changes represent an
enormous reduction in the payroll-processing time the accounting staff requires.

However, reducing the number of payroll cycles may engender a considerable
number of objections by employees. The main complaint is that they have
structured their spending habits around the old pay system. For example, employ-
ees who currently receive a paycheck every week may have a great deal of


442 Payroll Best Practices

difficulty in adjusting their spending to a paycheck that arrives only once a month.
Ifa company were to make a switch from a short to a long pay cycle, it is extremely
likely that the payroll staff will be deluged with requests for pay advances well
before the next paycheck is due for release, which will require a large effort to
handle. To overcome this problem, many companies only lengthen their pay cycles
incrementally, usually to once every two weeks or twice a month, and make it clear
to employees that pay advances will be granted for a limited transition period. By
making these incremental changes, a company can keep the level of employee
discontent to a minimum.

Another implementation point is to make sure that the rest of the management
team is supportive of the length of the new payroll cycle. They must buy into the
program because all of their employees will be impacted by the change. If they
receive an inordinate volume of complaints from their employees about this issue,
they may argue against the change; if enough of them do that, this best practice
may never succeed.

In short, consolidating and lengthening payroll cycles is an excellent method
for making a significant improvement to the efficiency of the payroll staff, but it
must be done with the full approval of the management team and with adequate
forewarning of all company employees.

18-26 Minimize Off-Cycle Payrolls

Every time the payroll department creates an off-cycle payroll, it requires a great
deal of additional work: reviewing open transactions, summarizing hours worked,
entering and cross-checking entries in the payroll software, running and reviewing
a payroll register, printing checks, and distributing them. Off-cycle payrolls are
needed when significant processing errors in a normal payroll cycle call for an
extra processing run, or when a department manager wants to issue a separate set of
paychecks to her staff, usually for bonuses.

There are a few ways to ensure that off-cycle payrolls are kept to a minimum.
One is to create an interdepartmental charge that is applied whenever a manager
demands that an extra payroll cycle be completed for her staff. If this fee is
sufficiently large, most managers will probably consent to having extra payments
added to the next regularly scheduled payroll cycle instead. Another alternative is
to require high-level approval, perhaps from the chief financial officer, to initiate an
off-cycle payroll; this also tends to keep managers from demanding such payrolls.

If payroll errors are caused extra payroll cycles to be run, then the payroll
manager should delay minor error adjustments until the next regularly scheduled
payroll cycle, only using a special cycle for inordinately large errors. The payroll
manager should consider in advance what types of errors will require an off-cycle
payroll and enter these decision points in the department procedures manual, so the

18-27 Create a Year-End Payroll Processing Checklist

The payroll function has so many tasks to attend to at the calendar year-end that it is
difficult not to forget some key tasks. When this happens, the payroll staff usually
pays for it later in the new year with reissued paychecks or W-2c forms, altered tax
remittances, and so on. All these corrections take more time to research and fix than
if they had been properly completed at the appropriate time. Also, a number of
tasks must be completed to prepare for the next payroll year, or else the payroll
staff will find itself scrambling to make retroactive changes later in the new year.

The solution is to create a year-end payroll processing checklist. If a company
outsources its payroll, its supplier probably maintains such a list and would be
happy to hand over a copy. Another approach is to gradually build up a checklist
over several years, including additional items as the payroll staff becomes aware of
new legal requirements or changes in company benefits that result in more tasks
to complete. The following list includes some of the more common closing tasks to
consider:

Final year-end payroll tasks

¢ Report the amount of employee income associated with group term life
insurance exceeding $50,000.

¢ Withhold for and report on taxable fringe benefits.
¢ Withhold for and report on third-party sick pay.

¢ Verify that all manual paychecks cut during the year have been included in the
payroll database.

¢ See if full-year pension plan deductions exceeded the allowable limit.
¢ Schedule a year-end bonus payroll.
¢ Create W-2 forms.

Preparing for new payroll year
¢ Verify the amount of unemployment tax rates and associated wage limits.

¢ Determine if a voluntary unemployment contribution should be made to
reduce the upcoming unemployment tax rate for the new year.

¢ Notify employees to review their W-4 forms.
¢ Update employee withholdings based on revised W-4 forms.

¢ Notify employees of unused flexible spending account deductions.

18-28 Electronically Verify Employee I-9 Information

It is becoming increasingly difficult for employers to maintain a legal workforce.
Immigration authorities have become more active in tracking down and removing
illegal aliens. Now the federal government has supplied a tool for verifying a new
hire’s citizenship information as provided by them on the Form 1-9.

The tool is called E-Verify, and it is accessed through the Internet, on the U.S.
Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) web site (www.uscis.gov). It is
operated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in partnership with the
Social Security Administration (SSA), and is a free resource that employers can
use to verify the Social Security numbers of their employees. It also includes a
photo-screening tool that allows an employer to check the photo on a new hire’s
Employment Authorization Document or Permanent Resident Card (green card)
against a large database of images stored in the DHS immigration databases.

The employer can initiate a query on the system only after an employee
accepts an offer of employment and has completed Form I-9. The employer must
initiate the query no later than the end of three business days after the new hire’s
actual start date. The results of a verification through the system normally take just
a few seconds. If the information presented does not match the government’s
databases, then the employer will be asked to review the accuracy of the
information just entered. Upon any reentry of information, the system will either
authorize employment, issue a tentative nonconfirmation, or state that DHS
verification is in process. The DHS verification in process message means that
the SSA match is correct but does not match the DHS information (which requires
additional time for a government review). If there is a tentative nonconfirmation,
then the employer must notify the new hire of the situation. The new hire can
resolve the issue by calling the USCIS or by going to any Social Security
Administration field office. If the issue is not resolved or the new hire does not
contact the government for resolution, then the case is considered to be a final
nonconfirmation and the employer can then terminate employment.

18-30 Outsource the Payroll Function 445

18-29 Reduce Taxes with the Common Paymaster Rule

When a company has multiple subsidiaries, it is possible that it will pay more
payroll taxes than are required by the law. This happens when employees transfer
between subsidiaries during the calendar year; every time they switch, they begin
compiling their Social Security wage base all over again with a different payroll
department, so they never have a chance to reach the current maximum wage base.
Since the company matches the Social Security payments to the government, this
means that the company pays additional payroll taxes if an employee would
otherwise have exceeded the maximum wage base. The same concept applies to
federal unemployment taxes (FUTA). Though employees can recover their share
of these excess withholdings, employers are not allowed to do so.

A company organized as a corporation can take advantage of the Common
Paymaster rule to avoid paying these extra taxes. Under this concept, a corporation
can calculate payroll taxes for employees being paid by multiple subsidiaries as
though they were being paid by a single organization for the entire year. The
following conditions must be met for the Common Paymaster rule to apply:

¢ The paying parties must be “related,” where either (1) a single company owns
at least half the stock of the other related companies, (2) at least 30 percent of
the employees of one corporation must be concurrently employed by the other
corporation, or (3) at least half of the officers of one corporation must be
officers of the other corporation.

¢ Ifacompany is a nonstock corporation, at least half the board of directors of
one corporation must also serve on the board of the other corporation.

¢ All payments made to employees must be through a single legal entity; thus,
the employee cannot be paid separately by multiple payroll departments
within the same company.

The last condition is key—all payments must be made from a single entity,
which calls for the consolidation of payroll departments in order to achieve the
available savings under this best practice.

The same concept can be used when a company wishes to credit any wages
paid to employees of a new acquiree to their wage base when being paid by the
acquiring company. The Common Paymaster rule can be applied in this scenario if
the acquirer has acquired substantially all of the assets of the acquiree, and if the
employees of the acquiree are immediately employed by the acquirer.

18-30 Outsource the Payroll Function

A typical in-house payroll department has many concerns. Besides the task of
issuing paychecks, it may have to do so for many company locations, where tax


446 Payroll Best Practices

rates differ, employees are paid on different dates, and tax payments must be made
to state governments by different means (e.g., direct deposit, bank deposit, or
mail), and W-2 forms must be issued to all employees at the beginning of each
year. Of all these issues, the one carrying the heaviest price for failure is a
government tax deposit—missing such a payment by just one day can carry a large
penalty that rapidly accumulates in size. All of these problems and costs can be
avoided by handing over some or all portions of the payroll function to an outside
supplier.

Payroll is one of the most commonly outsourced company functions. There
are several good reasons for this. First, a supplier will undertake to pay all payroll
taxes without troubling the company. The savings from avoiding government
penalties for late tax payments will, in some cases, pay for the entire cost of the
payroll supplier! In addition, the supplier can usually process payroll for all
company locations; several suppliers have locations in all major cities, so they can
handle paycheck deliveries to nearly any location. Other, smaller suppliers get
around not having multiple locations by sending checks to company locations with
overnight delivery services—either approach works well. Another advantage is
that nearly all payroll suppliers can deposit payments directly into employee bank
accounts, which is something that many in-house payroll systems, especially the
smaller ones, are incapable of performing. In addition, the time-consuming task of
stuffing checks into envelopes is one that suppliers will handle, thereby freeing up
the internal staff for less mundane work. A typical supplier also provides a wide
array of reports, usually including a report-writing package that can address any
special reporting needs. Once again, many smaller in-house payroll systems lack a
report-writing package, so this can be a real benefit. If these advantages are not
enough, also remember that payroll suppliers are staffed with a large team of
experts who can answer payroll questions over the phone, provide specialized or
standard training classes, or visit company locations for hands-on consulting. The
wide array of benefits has convinced thousands of companies to switch to an
outsourced payroll solution.

However, before jumping on the outsourcing bandwagon, consider a few
reasons for not using a payroll supplier. One is that outsourcing is generally more
expensive than an in-house solution, because the supplier must spend funds on
marketing its services and make a profit—two items that an in-house payroll staff
does not have to include in its budget. A supplier will usually sell its services to a
company by offering an apparently cheap deal with a small set of baseline services,
and then charge high fees for add-on services, such as direct deposit, check
stuffing, early check deliveries, report-writing software, and extra human resources
additions to the payroll software. As long as a company is well aware of these extra
fees and budgets them into its initial cost-benefit calculations, there should be no
surprises later on, as more supplier services are added and fees continue to rise.
Another problem is that the payroll database cannot be linked to a company’s other
computer systems. Since a company’s payroll data are usually located in a
mainframe computer at an off-site supplier location, it is nearly impossible to


18-31 Post FAQ Answers and Issue a Payroll Orientation Brochure 447

create an interface that will allow for user access to payroll data. The best
alternative (though a poor one) is to either keypunch the most important data
into a company payroll database from payroll reports printed by the supplier or to
download data from the supplier’s computer. Because of this missing database
linkage, a number of larger companies prefer to keep their payroll-processing work
in-house.

In short, there are many good reasons for a company to outsource its payroll
function to a qualified supplier. The only companies that should not do so are those
that are either highly sensitive to the cost of payroll processing or those that must
link their payroll data to other computer databases.

18-31 Post FAQ Answers and Issue a Payroll Orientation Brochure

Payroll departments spend a great deal of time answering employee questions
about their pay. According to some surveys, this involves at least one-third of all
department time! Though most of the questions are simple enough ones to answer,
when they are multiplied by the number of employees in the company, it is easy to
see how the payroll staff can spend so much time just responding to queries.

Ifthe payroll staff could compile a list of the most commonly asked questions by
employees, it would not be an especially long list—perhaps just 10 or 20 questions
for a basic payroll system, and maybe twice that amount if they also handle
benefits through the payroll system. Given the high proportion of questions
dealing with a limited number of issues, this is an ideal area in which to create
answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) and post them on a company
intranet site. Employees can then be directed to the FAQ list, and asked to address
the payroll staff regarding only the more complex questions. Sample FAQs and
their answers are as follows:

¢ If 1 am on direct deposit, at what time of day on payday will my pay be
deposited in my checking account?

° Your pay will be available in your checking account as of 8 A.M. on payday.
¢ If payday falls on a weekend, when am I paid?

° If payday falls on a weekend, you will be paid as of the last business day
prior to that weekend.

¢ Can I get an advance on my next paycheck?

o No. The company policy is to never issue pay advances under any
circumstances.

¢ If resign from the company, when will I be paid my final paycheck?

° If you voluntarily leave the company, you will be paid as part of the next
regularly scheduled payroll.


448 Payroll Best Practices

¢ How much unused vacation time can I roll forward into next year?

© You can roll 40 hours forward. For exceptional cases, you must apply to
your department manager for a waiver.

Though these FAQs can also be listed in the employee manual, employees do
not always refer to that document. By also presenting them on the intranet site
(which employees tend to access more frequently, especially if it is a rich,
multifunction site), there is a much greater chance that employees will access
the FAQs instead of the payroll staff.

The preceding list of FAQs and their related answers will address the bulk of
the payroll questions that employees are likely to have. However, some questions
involving process flow require a more comprehensive response, which can be
addressed with a payroll orientation brochure. For example, the brochure can
graphically describe the steps involved in entering hours worked into a company
time clock, or how to apply for vacation time.

The use of both FAQs answers and an orientation brochure forms an excellent
knowledge base for employees to fully understand the corporate payroll system.

Summary

This chapter primarily dealt with a variety of techniques for streamlining an
existing payroll system. The key improvement concepts are the use of automated
timekeeping systems, shifting some of the data-entry burden to employees and
managers, reducing the number of payroll cycles, and issuing electronic payments.
These changes leave the payroll staff in a monitoring role, which varies substan-
tially from its existing data-entry orientation. Though few companies would
implement all of the best practices listed in this chapter, given the variations in
how payroll is processed in some industries, there are still many techniques listed
here that a payroll manager should strongly consider installing.

Some of the best practices noted in this chapter work to the detriment of
employees. For example, in order to streamline the payroll function, a company
may do away with employee purchases and payroll advances, since these require
extra monitoring work from the payroll staff. However, if a company is in an
industry or geographical region where qualified employees are in short supply, it
may be a reasonable decision by the management team to allow these inefficiencies
to continue, rather than run the risk of losing employees over such minor
streamlining changes. Because of the impact on employees of many payroll
best practices, it is wise to consult with senior management prior to making
any significant changes and not to be surprised if the decision handed back is to
retain the status quo, despite higher levels of inefficiency.
