DISCLAIMER 
This guide was developed to help you identify 
key issues and best practices in the field of 
finance and accounting and is not intended in 
any way to be used to interpret laws or give 
legal advice. You should seek professional 
legal counsel on these issues for the latest 
interpretations and appropriate practices, 
as new laws and regulations are added and 
changed frequently.
EXCLUSIVE USAGE 
This guide was developed for the exclusive 
use of our clients. Express written permission 
is required to copy or distribute this document 
in any form outside of your organization, and it 
is not to be used for commercial gain.
This guide is for business owners and those respon-
sible for the finances of a business. Built on years of 
outsourced CFO experience, it includes best practices 
─ for startups as well as growing companies ─ that 
will help you understand and oversee the account-
ing process. You’ll see those actions needed to get 
your accounting up and running, and how the function 
evolves as your business does. By following these 
recommended steps, you’ll be laying the foundation for 
future growth. 
The chart below highlights when a company may find 
itself in a specific growth category and what infrastruc-
ture is typically in place at each stage: 
You have bills to pay, customers to invoice, and bank accounts to balance. Add 
to that producing your product or service, selling to prospects and keeping cus-
tomers happy, and it’s easy to become overwhelmed. Yet you can’t lose sight of 
your company’s finance and accounting needs. Whether you are pre-revenue or 
have grown revenue well into the millions, having solid accounting and finance 
functions is instrumental to your business getting any needed financing and in-
creasing profitability. But what should you have in place, and when?
INTRODUCTION
This guide can help you ensure that you have the right accounting infrastructure to allow you to soar to new 
heights. If your current to-do list is too large to manage all of this yourself, consider outsourcing your finance and 
accounting function. Outsourcing enables growing businesses to control costs, secure top accounting expertise, 
and free up limited internal resources to focus on building the business.

BASIC FINANCE  
ISSUES FOR  
STARTUP COMPANIES
As a startup, there is so much for you to do. In the account-
ing and finance realm, this includes properly setting up the 
business and your accounting function. There are forms to 
fill out and policies to develop. The following are best prac-
tices for pre-revenue companies just getting off the ground:
2
̆
̆
Obtain a Federal Tax ID by completing and filing 
IRS Form SS-4. 
̆
̆
Obtain a State Employer Number by completing 
and filing the appropriate form. Download your 
state’s form online, and if you are in California, 
be sure to file Form DE-1 with the Franchise Tax 
Board.
̆
̆
Establish a full-service commercial banking 
relationship. In most cases you can find a single 
institution to provide: 
•	
Commercial checking
•	
Online balance tracking
•	
electronic funds transfer services
•	
A money market account for cash in excess of 
30 days, so you earn interest income
̆
̆
Establish a disciplined approach to managing cash 
resources and document in an investment policy.
̆
̆
Contract with an online payroll service for regular 
payroll processing. Be sure the service includes 
tax reporting, automatic deposits of amounts with-
held from employee paychecks, and other special-
ized reporting services needed. Leading service 
providers include Intuit, ADP and Paychex. 
̆
̆
Establish basic policies and procedures as the 
initial step in creating a system of internal controls, 
including:
•	
Implement a cash management and control 
policy identifying:
•	
Recommended check signers and autho-
rization levels. Document this in a check 
signing and wire transfer authorization 
policy.
•	
Segregation of duties surrounding cash-
related transactions such as A/P voucher-
ing, issuance of checks, reconciliation of 
the monthly bank statements, custody of 
petty cash, issuance of customer sales 
invoices and posting of customer cash 
receipts. 
•	
Purchasing policy, guidelines and procedure 
for the issuance of purchase orders (POs), in-
cluding approval authorization guidelines and 
signature controls, tracking and approval of 
materials received and completion of services 
in accordance with authorized POs.
•	
Travel authorization and expense reimburse-
ment policies.
•	
Capital equipment and investment policy, also 
called a fixed asset capitalization policy.
•	
Guidelines for engagement of independent 
contractors for temporary or project-related 
resources. Consult legal counsel and account-
ing professionals to ensure compliance with 
employer payroll tax guidelines. The goal is to 
avoid miss-classification of payments to con-
tractors and ensure that unanticipated payroll 
taxes and workers’ compensation insurance 
liabilities are not incurred. 
̆
̆
Establish a signature authorization policy ap-
proved by the board of directors setting approval 
guidelines and limits for purchasing, staff addi-
tions, compensation, travel and other contract 
commitments. Be sure to:
•	
Communicate in writing to key personnel
•	
Identify each person in an authority matrix 
based on existing staff
•	
Update at regular intervals
Getting Started as a Corporate Entity
3
̆
̆
Set up the basic accounting and finance infrastruc-
ture on a traditional PC-based or web-enabled 
accounting software solution including:
•	
A general ledger with a chart of accounts tai-
lored to your business
•	
Cash management function with online track-
ing and other bank-related information
•	
An accounts payable module linked to a ven-
dor master and open PO file, as well as open-
item tracking and aging analysis functions
̆
̆
Establish the basic accounting policies and proce-
dures for the following: 
•	
Fiscal accounting calendar
•	
Payroll
•	
Accounts payable
•	
General ledger maintenance
•	
Cash management
•	
Accounts receivable
•	
Fixed assets and depreciation
̆
̆
Establish financial reporting policy including:
•	
Recommended report formats for a: 
•	
P&L
•	
Balance sheet
•	
Analysis of cash flow
•	
Operating expense by function
•	
Plan comparisons and analyses (e.g., 
as actual vs. plan/budget with “waterfall” 
tracking and concise narrative explana-
tions of significant variances)
•	
Reporting frequency and time deadlines
•	
Typically, key metrics such cash status 
and operating results are reported at 
least monthly at staff meetings in order 
to accommodate questions and feedback 
dialogue in real time.
•	
A well-organized accounting cycle will 
allow reporting of final data with compari-
sons to plan/budget within 10 calendar 
days from the end of the prior accounting 
period.
•	
Control and distribution of confidential data
•	
Supporting detail/sub-ledgers and reconcilia-
tion integrity
̆
̆
Evaluate the complexity and workload associated 
with the accounting function and recruit and hire a 
qualified staff or select an outsourced service pro-
vider. (A typical staff matrix is shown in the finan-
cial infrastructure timeline overview on page 1). 
This is an iterative, qualitative process, with daily 
requirements evolving in concert with the growth 
and development of the business. 
̆
̆
Solicit, evaluate and select a licensed certified 
public accountant (CPA) firm to conduct annual 
audits of financial records and systems of internal 
controls. If the accounting and control environ-
ment is sufficiently complex, a formal request for 
proposal process may be justified to ensure that 
all relevant issues are clearly communicated for 
prospective service providers.
•	
Wherever possible, use a qualified CPA firm 
to assist in the preparation and timely filing of 
annual income tax returns and benefits plan 
Installing an Essential Accounting and Finance Infrastructure

compliance reports.
•	
The appointment of the CPA firm must be 
approved by the board of directors (subject to 
ratification by shareholder vote in most cases). 
•	
Solicit competitive bids from multiple firms. Ne-
gotiate a predetermined fee for these services 
on an annual basis. If budgets and staffing 
allow, the audit firm should perform a review of 
the financial reports (at least once per year), 
systems and controls with pertinent observa-
tions documented in a letter to the CEO and 
board of directors. 
•	
When the company’s business approaches the 
scale sufficient to begin considering a filing for 
an initial public offering (IPO), the independent 
auditor reviews should be conducted quarterly. 
̆
̆
Establish physical control of the company’s fixed 
assets: 
•	
Each purchased item at or above capitaliza-
tion cost levels and with qualifying useful life 
shall be entered in a fixed assets log or data-
base when placed in service. Costs incurred 
for capital equipment requiring assembly of 
multiple components, special site preparation 
or freight must be collected in a temporary 
cost ledger and consolidated as one item at 
completion for the purpose of physical control 
and tracking. 
•	
Affix individual pre-numbered tags or labels to 
each capitalized item. 
•	
Maintain a database log recording issuance 
of fixed assets by tag number, original cost 
and person responsible for each item as it is 
placed in service. 
̆
̆
Establish a fundamental employment policy and 
guidelines for engagement of independent con-
tractors. Seek expert advice from a tax accountant 
and obtain rules and criterion used to determine 
employment vs. independent contractor status. 
•	
Utilize legal guidance to ensure proper clas-
sification of wages, payroll taxes and workers’ 
compensation insurance coverage. 
•	
For temporary and part-time employees, set 
guidelines for eligibility under group insurance 
and other benefits. 
̆
̆
Establish and maintain control of the issuance of 
the company’s capital stock certificates and main-
tain secure auditable records. 
•	
Seek advice of corporate counsel to initiate 
printing and control of stock certificates. 
•	
Maintain a stock book of record indicating 
owner names, addresses and denomination of 
each share certificate. 
•	
Compile a capital stock capitalization sum-
mary table by class, indicating total issued 
and outstanding shares, as well as shares 
reserved for issuance under stock option 
plans. This compilation must be regularly 
updated and accurate and auditable at all 
times.
•	
Draft a detailed employee incentive stock op-
tion plan in compliance with articles of incorpo-
ration/by-laws to be approved by the board of 
directors and ratified by shareholder vote. 
•	
Obtain approval of the board of directors or 
the compensation committee comprised of 
outside directors prior to granting of employee 
stock options. 
5
̆
̆
All significant accounting policies should be de-
veloped to be consistent with generally accepted 
accounting principles in the United States (U.S. 
GAAP). The broad elements of U.S. GAAP finan-
cial reporting relate to the following: 
•	
Recognition - For example, assets, liabilities, 
equity, revenue and gains, expenses and loss-
es, and other comprehensive income recorded 
on the accrual basis of accounting. 
•	
Measurement - For example, historical cost, 
fair value (or lower of cost or market), and the 
methodology used to measure. 
•	
Presentation - For example, a cash flow state-
ment. 
•	
Disclosure - For example, notes to financial 
statements that aid in interpretation of the 
schedules presented. 
̆
̆
A process of designing and documenting the 
underlying accounting practices and reporting 
consistent with U.S. GAAP is highly recommended 
for all early stage companies. In virtually all cases, 
U.S. GAAP does not currently provide for different 
accounting based on whether an entity is large or 
small, public or private. Therefore, principals of 
U.S. GAAP are not to be viewed as concepts to 
“grow into at some later date.”
̆
̆
Develop a summary-level, 5-year strategic plan 
for update and approval annually by the board of 
directors
•	
Starting with the company’s initial seed-level 
funding proposal, create a more comprehen-
sive planning document to include a descrip-
tion of the proprietary intellectual property (IP) 
and product differentiation to create or expand 
upon a measurable market opportunity. 
•	
Focus on refining the company’s vision and 
major overriding objectives to be achieved in 
the 5-year time horizon. 
•	
State the principal strategy to deliver results, 
given a well-defined set of assumptions or 
anticipated market conditions. 
•	
Develop financial projections consistent with 
the main components of the strategic plan 
outlined above. 
̆
̆
Develop an annual operating plan with an integrat-
ed methodology linking annual objectives to those 
established in the 5-year strategic plan.
•	
Gather market intelligence from reliable third-
party sources, prepare the current situation 
analysis and define multiple planning sce-
narios. 
•	
Define the annual corporate objectives and 
principal strategy, building consensus at all 
levels. 
•	
Once top-level goals are set, develop cas-
caded goals for each functional responsibility 
or line organization with commitments from 
responsible staff. 
•	
Develop detailed staffing plans, operating 
expense budgets, sales projections, product 
shipment projections, and manufacturing and 
fulfillment cost projections.
•	
Consolidate and finalize the financial plan 
linked to the execution of strategy and attain-
ment of objectives. 
•	
Conduct internal executive review and approv-
al, and then submit to the board of directors 
for review, approval and adoption. 
•	
Integrate detailed financial budgets and 
operating targets into regular financial report-
ing methodology as a basis for actual perfor-
mance measurement and feedback. 
Establishing U.S. GAAP Accounting Principles
Implementing Company-Wide Financial Planning Discipline
6
̆
̆
Determine office and operations space require-
ments sufficient to support the company’s opera-
tions for at least 24 months. A general guideline is 
to allow about 250 square feet for each employee, 
with separate consideration for lab space, ware-
house and shipping/receiving dock space. 
̆
̆
Select a location and negotiate a lease for an ap-
propriate term. If financing of tenant improvements 
is required, select the lowest cost alternative 
(explore options for landlord financing with costs 
amortized into the lease payment vs. external 
financing sources).
̆
̆
Other critical negotiation points in commercial 
lease agreements are likely to include: 
•	
Term and options to extend, conditions of early 
termination, ability to sublease
•	
Lease costs subject to cost of living adjust-
ment
•	
Tenant/landlord responsibility to maintain and 
pay the costs of liability insurance covering 
damage to the building and personal property 
from all risks, subject to possible exclusions 
for flood, earthquake, acts of God, etc.
•	
Tenant/landlord responsibility for regular build-
ing maintenance and landscaping expenses
•	
Parking privileges, signage, multiple tenant 
building access, and other parcel-specific is-
sues
̆
̆
Corporate document control; maintaining sound 
recordkeeping and file retention discipline is 
extremely important. Begin by establishing se-
cure physical files on the premises and assign an 
employee as custodian of key records such as 
material agreements, certified BOD meeting min-
utes, capital stock records, confidential HR files, 
licenses, etc. The following are some corporate 
milestone activities that will require efficient and 
extensive access to critical files and records. 
•	
Conducting annual audits
•	
Defending litigation claims or threats
•	
Supporting investor due diligence
•	
Filing for an IPO 
̆
̆
Risk management
•	
Solicit quotes and acquire property and 
casualty insurance coverage at appropriate 
levels and deductibles. Coverage limits and 
premium costs are ostensibly tied to the value 
of the company’s tangible assets and revenue 
run-rate. 
•	
Review coverage limits and deductibles for 
general liability and business interruption 
coverage at least once per year. Consult with 
an insurance broker or utilize outside experts 
to guarantee a thorough and comprehensive 
analysis. 
•	
Implement data protection measures, includ-
ing daily backup of computer files and remote 
storage of backup media containing copies of 
critical data such as financial records, com-
puter source code and design files.

EXPANDED FINANCIAL 
MANAGEMENT FOR 
GROWING COMPANIES 
Your company is up and running and you’re finally 
making money, perhaps a lot of it. Now that the 
foundation is in place, it’s time to focus on policies 
that will work with your increasing number of em-
ployees and revenue. (If you haven’t tackled any 
of the basic finance issues for startups mentioned 
on previous pages, you’ll want to take care of them 
before jumping into this list of best practices.) 
8
̆
̆
Establish an appropriate revenue recognition 
policy that is in the compliance with U.S. GAAP 
(ASC 606).
̆
̆
Establish pricing policy and controls for products 
and services. Key points to consider: 
•	
Issuance of a standard pricing schedule (may 
require internal and “external” lists that can be 
viewed by customers
•	
Override procedure and approval authority for 
special cases
•	
Overlay of competitive pricing status compiled 
by marketing staff
•	
Underlying cost dynamics compiled by finance 
staff as key ingredients to the decision process
̆
̆
Establish customer credit policies and related 
internal controls governing order processing, ship 
authorization, credit limit authorization and collec-
tions administration. Key points to consider: 
•	
The lead finance executive is responsible for 
setting credit policy and maintaining controls.
•	
Set credit limit amounts at levels appropriate 
for the customer’s creditworthiness and order 
backlog or anticipated monthly purchasing 
demand.
•	
Establish a consistent format for compiling 
reference checking information.
•	
Use independent, third-party credit informa-
tion sources (such as D&B) for payment track 
record on like commodities for prospective 
customers to enhance internally generated 
credit information.
̆
̆
Establish inventory management and control 
policy and physical control measures. 
•	
Tracking and control must be tied to purchas-
ing authorization, cost accounting and credit/
ship authorization policies.
•	
Build and staff a secure warehouse, as ap-
propriate.
•	
Sales demo, engineering and or prototype 
materials must be segregated and tracked.
•	
Formulate state sales tax reporting and com-
pliance policy and procedure covering product 
shipments, electronically delivered software, 
services and internally consumed materials.
•	
For product manufacturing companies, 
establish a cross-functional master schedul-
ing policy to coordinate customer contract/
backlog and credit status, and overall demand 
forecasting with fulfillment, including repeti-
tive purchasing of inventories, manufacturing 
schedules and delivery mechanisms (MRP). 
This requirement comes to light as produc-
tion volume grows at a rapid rate such that 
early-stage planning and control systems are 
pushed to their limit.
̆
̆
Establish customer return (RMA) and product war-
ranty policy commensurate with industry practice 
and customer adoption stage. 
Essential Steps to Support Revenue Launch
9
•	
Procedures must be set to rapidly evaluate 
and segregate materials returned from cus-
tomers and establish RMA lot tracking proce-
dures for processing. Early diagnosis of the 
nature of the return is important, particularly to 
determine whether the repair is covered under 
the warranty (company expense) or non-war-
ranty (customer expense).
•	
Summarizing the main role of finance for con-
trolling in-warranty returns and non-warranty 
returns: 
•	
Establish accurate visibility for all transac-
tions impacting the assets of the company 
(returns to inventory) and proper inventory 
classification and valuation.
•	
For in-warranty returns: Maintain tracking 
of customers’ inventory as evaluation and/
or repair is conducted.
•	
For all RMA transactions: When shipment 
back to customer is made, timely inter-
nal tracking and the complete cost of the 
warranty or repair effort for the transaction 
must be recorded.
̆
̆
Establish inventory control guidelines and mea-
surement metrics such as inventory turnover, 
slow-moving inventory and other appropriate 
criteria. Appropriate inventory accounting valua-
tion adjustments will be required as internal control 
and management accountability guidelines evolve. 
Inventory turnover is calculated as follow: 
Turnover = [Annualized cost of goods sold] /  
Ending (or average) inventory value
Operating companies in the electronics industry 
typically target the inventory turnover ratio as fol-
lows:
 
Initial product, after 12 months of production:	
 
10 – 12X
Multiple products, mature phase: 
7 – 9 X
̆
̆
Establish balance sheet reserves to properly state 
the fair value of assets and liabilities. Determine 
a methodology to support the balances provided. 
Ensure that the methodology for calculating each 
reserve is quantitative in nature (minimizing reli-
ance upon management’s judgment) and consis-
tently applied from period to period. Examples of 
reserves provided for critical accounts include the 
following:
•	
Allowance for doubtful accounts—applies to 
valuation of accounts receivable associated 
with risk of non-collectability. The provision is 
typically recorded as a component of indirect 
operating expenses and carried as a contra 
(credit) in current assets.
•	
Reserve for sales returns and allowances—
applies to revenue recognition and valuation of 
accounts receivable associated with potential 
product returns, credit card charge-backs, 
and future discounts applied to outstanding 
invoices. The provision is typically recorded as 
a contra (debit) to current period revenue and 
established as a current liability.
•	
Deferred revenue—applies to the treatment of 
advance payments received from customers 
for which delivery or other revenue recognition 
criterion has not been satisfied. The provi-
sion is typically initiated by receipt of payment 
(debit to cash) with an offsetting credit to a 
deferred revenue account classified as a cur-
rent liability.
•	
Warranty reserve—applies to estimated costs 
to honor product warranties that must be 
matched with current revenue. Typically, a 
warranty reserve provision is recorded as a 
debit to cost of goods sold with a correspond-
ing credit to a reserve account classified as a 
current liability.
•	
Inventory valuation reserves—applies to esti-
mated devaluation of the carrying value of in-
ventory that may be the result of physical loss, 
deflation of unit costs, obsolescence, or lower 
of cost or market adjustments. The provision is 
typically recorded as a debit to current period 
cost of goods sold with a corresponding credit 
to a reserve or contra account classified within 
the current asset category.
10
̆
̆
Solicit and negotiate an asset-based loan facility 
with a financial institution to fund working capital 
requirements and/or provide equipment leasing 
arrangements as required.
•	
For an accounts receivable line of credit, be 
cognizant of the qualifying terms that will 
determine collateral eligibility in loan formulas, 
such as aging, degree of concentration of the 
portfolio due from any one customer, eligibil-
ity for export customers, amounts due from 
related-party entities, or amounts due from 
creditors (cross-aging).
•	
Carefully analyze loan covenants and other fi-
nancial restrictions that may be implicit in loan 
and security agreements. 
̆
̆
The CEO and CFO are responsible for directing 
the organization to respond to the requests of the 
independent audit firm so as to deliver annual 
certified audited financial statements and reviews 
of internal controls on a timely basis and to avoid 
excessive (higher than anticipated) audit fees. 
•	
Establish a corporate governance policy with 
assistance from legal counsel; appoint audit 
and compensation committees of the board 
of directors comprised of 100 percent outside 
directors, if possible.
•	
Define roles and responsibilities at all levels.
•	
Establish accountabilities linking responsible 
executive officers with key personnel assigned 
to carry out functional duties.
•	
Establish linkage between responsible em-
ployees (officers) to relevant directors, outside 
counsel, and the company’s audit firm.
•	
Establish company-wide employee perfor-
mance appraisal standards and policy linked 
to compensation policy approved by the board 
of directors.

̆
̆
Develop a basic system of internal controls by 
following accepted practices and documenta-
tion methodology that have proven successful for 
companies which have complied with Section 404 
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX 404).
̆
̆
Establish, document and maintain controls that 
enable management to support all representations 
and assertions imbedded in the company’s finan-
cial statements. These representations and asser-
tions are classified in the following categories:
•	
Existence or occurrence: addresses whether 
assets or liabilities exist at a given date.
•	
Completeness: addresses whether all trans-
actions that should be presented in financial 
statements are included.
•	
Valuation: addresses whether all assets, liabili-
ties, equity, income and expense are stated at 
the proper amount.
•	
Rights and obligations: addresses whether 
assets embody the rights of the company and 
liabilities are the obligations of the company at 
a given date.
•	
Presentation and disclosure: addresses 
whether particular components of the financial 
statements are properly classified, described 
and disclosed.
̆
̆
Start by taking the following steps:
•	
Become familiar with the basics of the Com-
mittee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) 
standards, the universally accepted set of 
guidelines for developing and evaluating 
systems of internal control over financial re-
porting. Similarly, the COBIT standards apply 
to controls over information technology (IT), 
including network data security. COSO stan-
dards identify five key components of effective 
systems of internal control: 
•	
A sound control environment
•	
Risk assessment
•	
Control activities
•	
Information and communication 
•	
Monitoring
•	
Apply COSO standards by considering each 
of the five key components. Examples of how 
this is accomplished is illustrated below:
•	
Control environment
•	
Demonstrate management buy-in 
and support for effective controls 
(“tone at the top”), including involve-
ment of the board of directors.
•	
Track and focus the organization on 
meeting or exceeding key perfor-
mance indicators or metrics.
•	
Demonstrate and reinforce behavior 
Implementing a System of Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
12
consistent with a corporate ethics 
policy in all dealings.
•	
Maintain an open communication 
channel for whistleblowers and em-
ploy all measures to prevent recrimi-
nation.
•	
Risk assessment
•	
Define the company’s internal control 
hierarchy.
•	
Prepare a risk assessment matrix on 
each key process.
•	
Tailor design of controls to detect/
minimize errors in high-risk cycles.
•	
Control activities
•	
Prepare and maintain internal control 
documentation.
•	
Ensure segregation of duties and 
cross-training.
•	
Ensure physical safeguarding of as-
sets.
•	
Prepare financial statements at the 
management level supported by 
independent account reconciliations 
at the staff level.
•	
Information and communication
•	
Publish written procedures and train 
key staff.
•	
Conduct interactive management 
meetings.
•	
Monitoring
•	
Conduct walk-throughs and other 
testing of key controls
•	
Report and correct weaknesses or 
sources of errors in financial reports 
as they are detected.
•	
Update processes and documenta-
tion and re-train.
̆
̆
Implement an internal control system development 
project, as follows:
•	
Examine and understand your control hierar-
chy and perform a risk assessment.
•	
Define the most critical controls over 
financial reporting and map them to key 
accounts that comprise the financial state-
ments, in the following top-down hierar-
chy: 
•	
Significant accounts
•	
Business processes
•	
Accounting policies and financial 
statement assertions
•	
Controls
•	
Judge risk on the likelihood that a weak-
ness or breakdown will cause a material 
misstatement in the financial reporting.
•	
Rank significant accounts according to

SUMMARY
In the best scenarios, the accounting system is set up prop-
erly from the start of the business. But when it’s not, growing 
companies need to identify their gaps and readjust to put the 
right infrastructure in place. That’s the reason this guide was 
developed. You need to follow laws that govern finance and ac-
counting, and you also need to have accurate financial data to 
set your strategy and grow your business.
Your financial information will be used to judge the financial 
condition of your company, and that’s too important not to get 
right, especially when it can impact funding. Your company, 
your board of directors, your creditors, your investors, and other 
stakeholders will rely on your reporting. It can become a make-
or-break system for you. As your business gets more sophis-
ticated, so should your finance and accounting infrastructure. 
Following the best practices in the guide will help you build an 
infrastructure that can grow with you.
