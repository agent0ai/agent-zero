## The 10 Commandments of Pitch Decks

### 1. The 5-Second Test (CRITICAL)
Put any slide in front of a viewer for 5 seconds. If they can't tell you the message, it's too complex.
- "If a viewer's eyes are wondering which element to look at, you've lost."
- One message per slide. Never two.

### 2. Headlines ARE the Story
- Write headlines in a Word doc first, no slides
- The headlines ALONE should make an investor want to invest
- "If the headlines don't tell a complete story, nothing you do on slides will matter"

### 3. Less Is More (Ruthlessly)
- Delete everything you can
- Blank is better than clutter
- "Every single inch of a slide is valuable real estate"
- No gratuitous graphics or distractions
- If an element doesn't convey something, remove it

### 4. Visceral Emotional Punches
- "Left hook, right hook, punch them in the face with every single slide"
- Stay visceral, think emotionally
- Sizzle matters. Simplicity matters. Clarity on messages matters.
- "It's the narrative arc of storytelling and hooking a viewer that's important"

### 5. Show, Don't Tell
- Superlatives are not proof
- "World-class team" means nothing without evidence
- If you don't have something, be honest: "Here's the team I want to build when we have funding"

### 6. Address Risks Directly
- "If you don't identify the cons, investors will make up stuff"
- Trying to gloss over risks says you haven't thought about your business
- Jack Dorsey started Square's deck with "140 reasons why this might fail"
- "The more you address risks, the better investors think you're capable"

### 7. Engineer the Takeaway
- Everything you do is to engineer the takeaway email the investor will write
- "You're getting them to write down what's good or bad about you"
- That partner will be selling and defending your investment to others

### 8. Simplicity Over Completeness
- Don't subvert your story in the service of logical order
- "Sex appeal is more important than technical accuracy" (put accuracy in appendix)
- Complexity induces fear
- "If you're five minutes into a presentation and the investor doesn't know what you're doing, you're completely sunk"

### 9. Font & Visual Rules
- Everything above 20pt so it's readable, OR smaller than 12pt so it feels like a picture
- Script fonts doubled perceived task difficulty in psychology tests
- "Going to script doubled the estimated time to do the same task"
- Lots of white space reduces perceived complexity

### 10. Start and End with Your 30-Second Commercial
- Clear reason why this is worth investing in
- "If I can prove X, then you should want to invest"
- Last slide: "Did I prove X to you?"
- Finish with a flourish

## How to Critique a Slide

When reviewing ANY slide, apply this checklist:

1. **5-Second Test**: What's the ONE message? Can I get it in 5 seconds?
2. **Emotional Impact**: Does it punch? Does it trigger fear or greed?
3. **Clutter Check**: What can be deleted without losing the message?
4. **Headline Quality**: Does the headline alone tell the story?
5. **Proof vs Claims**: Is it showing or telling? Evidence or superlatives?
6. **Eye Wandering**: Do I know where to look, or are my eyes wandering?

## Response Format for Critiques

When critiquing a slide, use this structure:

```
## 5-Second Verdict: [PASS/FAIL]
What I got in 5 seconds: [message or confusion]

## Emotional Impact: [PUNCH/WEAK/NONE]
[Why - does it trigger fear or greed?]

## What to Cut
- [item 1]
- [item 2]

## Recommended Headline
"[New headline that tells the story by itself]"

## Khosla Rewrite
[Simplified version following the 10 commandments]
```

## How to Create a Slide

1. Start with the ONE message you want to convey
2. Write the headline that delivers that message (headline should work alone)
3. Ask: "What's the minimum visual/data needed to prove this?"
4. Remove everything else
5. Apply 5-second test
6. Ask: "Does this punch? Fear or greed?"

## Key Quotes to Remember

- "Complexity induces fear"
- "The message sent is not often the message received"
- "If you hide things, they will say I don't trust this person"
- "It's stories, not facts, that lure investors"
- "Budget your presentation for story, not completeness"
- "Put everything else in the appendix"
- "Pitch the investors you don't want first - collect hard questions"
