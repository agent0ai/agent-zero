## Executive Summary

This guide presents the latest NIST framework for cybersecurity incident response, integrating incident response activities throughout organizational cybersecurity risk management using the Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0. The document represents a fundamental shift from treating incident response as isolated activities to embedding it as a critical component of enterprise-wide cybersecurity risk management.

## Key Definitions

### Cybersecurity Incident
> An occurrence that actually or imminently jeopardizes, without lawful authority, the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of information or an information system; or constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of law, security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies.

### Event vs. Incident
- **Event**: Any observable occurrence involving computing assets
- **Adverse Event**: Any event with negative consequences
- **Cybersecurity Incident**: Adverse cybersecurity events requiring organizational response

## CSF 2.0 Six-Function Framework

### 1. Govern (GV)
**Purpose**: Establish cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy
**Incident Response Role**: Governance framework, policies, and strategic direction

### 2. Identify (ID)
**Purpose**: Understand current cybersecurity risks
**Incident Response Role**: Asset management, risk assessment, continuous improvement

### 3. Protect (PR)
**Purpose**: Implement safeguards to manage cybersecurity risks
**Incident Response Role**: Preventive controls reducing incident likelihood and impact

### 4. Detect (DE)
**Purpose**: Find and analyze possible cybersecurity attacks and compromises
**Incident Response Role**: Monitoring, analysis, and incident declaration

### 5. Respond (RS)
**Purpose**: Take actions regarding detected cybersecurity incidents
**Incident Response Role**: Core incident response activities including management, analysis, communication, and mitigation

### 6. Recover (RC)
**Purpose**: Restore assets and operations affected by cybersecurity incidents
**Incident Response Role**: Recovery planning, execution, and communication

## Incident Response Life Cycle Model

### Preparation Layer (Foundation)
- **Functions**: Govern, Identify, Protect
- **Activities**: Policy development, asset management, risk assessment, protective controls
- **Timing**: Continuous, ongoing activities

### Continuous Improvement Layer
- **Function**: Identify (Improvement Category)
- **Activities**: Real-time lesson integration, process enhancement
- **Timing**: Continuous feedback loops throughout all activities

### Incident Response Layer
- **Functions**: Detect, Respond, Recover
- **Activities**: Detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery
- **Timing**: Triggered by incident declaration, continues through recovery

## Common Incident Types

### Network-Based Attacks
- **DDoS Attacks**: Botnet-driven high-volume requests making services unavailable
- **Network Intrusion**: Unauthorized access for credential theft and system manipulation
- **Supply Chain Compromise**: Vendor software compromised and distributed to customers

### Data-Focused Incidents
- **Credential Compromise**: Attackers obtaining privileged access to systems
- **Ransomware**: Malware preventing system use while copying sensitive files
- **Data Exfiltration**: Unauthorized copying and transmission of organizational data

### Social Engineering
- **Phishing Campaigns**: Email-based attacks compromising user accounts
- **Business Email Compromise**: Impersonation attacks targeting financial transactions
- **Insider Threats**: Malicious or negligent actions by authorized personnel

## Incident Response Roles and Responsibilities
