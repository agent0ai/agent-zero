Preface

 

The accounting department is a cost center. It does not directly generate revenues,
but rather provides a fixed set of services to the rest of a company, and is asked to
do so at the lowest possible cost. Consequently, the accounting staff is called
upon to process transactions, write reports, create new processes or investigate
old ones—while doing so as an ever-shrinking proportion of total expenses.

This cost-based environment is a very difficult one for most accountants, for
their training is primarily in accounting rules and regulations, rather than in how
to run a very specialized department in a cost-effective manner. They find a few
ideas for improvements from attending seminars or perusing accounting or man-
agement magazines, but there is no centralized source of information for them to
consult, which itemizes a wide array of possible improvements. Hence the need
for the third edition of Accounting Best Practices.

This book is compiled from the author’s lengthy experience in setting up and
operating a number of accounting departments, as well as by providing consult-
ing services to other companies. Accordingly, it contains a blend of best practices
from a wide variety of accounting environments, ranging from very small part-
nerships to multibillion-dollar corporations. This means that not all of the best
practices described within these pages will be useful in every situation—some
are designed to provide quick and inexpensive, incremental improvements to an
operation that can be installed in a day, while others are groundbreaking events
that require six-figure investments (or more) and months of installation time.
Some will only work for companies of a certain size, and should be discarded as
more expensive and comprehensive accounting systems are installed—it all depends
on the situation. Consequently, each chapter includes a table that notes the ease,
duration, and cost of implementation for every best practice within it. The best
practices are also noted in summary form in Appendix A.

This third edition of Best Practices contains 60 new best practices. These are
concentrated in the areas of internal auditing, accounts payable, finance, and pay-
roll. Some of the best practices involve solutions that have been posted on various
Internet sites, but there are fewer of these best practices than appeared in the sec-
ond edition. Indeed, a great many Internet sites listed in the second edition have
closed down, requiring the author to remove three best practices that had been
listed in that book. The area of application service providers has been especially
hard hit, with about two-thirds of the providers listed in the second edition having
shut their doors in the past two years.

Chapter 15 is new, containing 19 best practices for the internal auditing func-
tion. Though this area sometimes falls outside of the accounting function by
reporting directly to the auditing committee of the board of directors, it more

viii


Preface ix

commonly reports to the chief financial officer, and therefore a discussion of
improvements to it appears relevant for this book.

Accounts payable remains the area with the largest concentration of best
practices, with the total now rising to 40 just in this area. A number of risk man-
agement and investor management best practices have also been added to the
finance chapter, as well as a smattering of best practices to a half-dozen other
chapters. The result is 292 best practices to assist the reader in creating a more
efficient and effective accounting department.

Given the large number of best practices in this book, it would have become
quite difficult to locate specific items under the structure used in the second edi-
tion. Accordingly, a table has been added to the front of each chapter, itemizing
by subcategory the best practices located within it. For example, the accounts
payable chapter sorts best practices into the categories of approvals, credit cards,
documents, expense reports, management, payments, purchasing, and suppliers.
A reference number is assigned to each best practice in the table, which one can
then use to find the best practice within the chapter. The tables also graphically
describe the cost and duration of implementation required for each item, which is
repeated throughout the text that follows the descriptions of each best practice.
For additional ease of indexing, these tables are collected into Appendix A.

Finally, a selection of best practices have an “Author’s Choice” icon posted
next to them. These best practices are those the author has found to be particu-
larly effective in improving accounting operations.

Chapter 1

 

Introduction

A chief executive officer (CEO) spends months deciding on a corporate strategy.
The plan probably includes a mix of changes in products, customers, and markets,
as well as demands for increased efficiencies or information in a number of exist-
ing areas. The CEO then hands off the plan to a group of managers who are quite
capable of implementing many of the changes, but who scratch their heads over
how to squeeze greater efficiencies or information out of existing departments in
order to meet their strategic goals. This is where best practices come into play.

A best practice is really any improvement over existing systems, though
some consultants prefer to confine the definition to those few high-end and very
advanced improvements that have been successfully installed by a few world-
class companies. This book uses the broader definition of any improvement over
existing systems, since the vast majority of companies are in no position, either in
terms of technological capabilities, monetary resources, or management skill, to
make use of truly world-class best practices. Using this wider definition, a best
practice can be anything that increases the existing level of efficiency, such as
switching to blanket purchase orders, signature stamps, and procurement cards to
streamline the accounts payable function. It can also lead to improved levels of
reporting for use by other parts of the company, such as activity-based costing,
target costing, or direct costing reports in the costing function. Further, it can
reduce the number of transaction errors, by such means as automated employee
expense reports, automated bank account deductions, or a simplified commission
calculation system. By implementing a plethora of best practices, a company can
greatly improve its level of efficiency and information reporting, which fits nicely
into the requirements of most strategic plans.

One can go further than describing best practices as an excellent contributor
to the fulfillment of a company’s strategy, and even state that a strategy does not
have much chance of success unless best practices are involved. The reason is
that best practices have such a large impact on overall efficiencies, they unleash a
large number of excess people who can then work on other strategic issues, as
well as reduce a company’s cash requirements, releasing more cash for invest-
ment in strategic targets. In addition, some best practices link company functions
more closely together, resulting in better overall functionality —this is a singular
improvement when a company is in the throes of changes caused by strategy
shifts. Further, best practices can operate quite well in the absence of a strategic
plan. For example, any department manager can install a variety of best practices


2 Introduction

with no approval or oversight from above, resulting in a multitude of beneficial
changes. Thus, best practices are a linchpin of the successful corporate strategy,
and can also lead to improvements even if they are not part of a grand strategic
vision.

The scope of this book does not encompass all of the best practices that a
company should consider, only those used by the accounting department. This
area is especially susceptible to improvement through best practices, since it is heavily
procedure-driven. When there are many procedures, there are many opportunities
to enhance the multitude of procedure steps through automation, simplification,
elimination of tasks, error-proofing, and outsourcing. Thus, of all the corporate
functions, this is the one that reacts best to treatment through best practices.

Chapter 2 covers a variety of issues related to the implementation of best
practices, such as differentiating between incremental and reengineering changes,
circumstances under which best practices are most likely to succeed, and how to
plan and proceed with these implementations. Most important, there is a discus-
sion of the multitude of reasons why a best practice implementation can fail,
which is excellent reading prior to embarking on a new project, in order to be
aware of all possible pitfalls. The chapter ends with a brief review of the impact
of best practices on employees. This chapter is fundamental to the book, for it
serves as the groundwork on which the remaining chapters are built. For example,
if you are interested in modifying the general ledger account structure for use by
an activity-based costing system, it is necessary to first review the implementa-
tion chapter to see how any programming, software package, or interdepartmental
issues might impact the project.

Chapters 3 through 17 each describe a cluster of best practices, with a func-
tional area itemized under each chapter. For example, Chapter 8 covers a variety
of improvements to a company’s commission calculation and payment systems,
while Chapter 17 is strictly concerned with a variety of payroll-streamlining
issues related to the collection of employee time information, processing it into
payments, and distributing those payments. Chapter 13 is a catchall chapter. It
covers a variety of general best practices that do not fit easily into other, more
specific chapters. Examples of these best practices are the use of process-centering,
on-line reporting, and creating a contract-terms database. Chapters 3 through 17
are the heart of the book since they contain information related to nearly 300 best
practices.

For Chapters 3 through 17, there is an exhibit near the beginning that shows
the general level of implementation cost and duration for each of the best prac-
tices in the chapter. This information gives the reader a good idea of which best
practices to search for and read through, in case these criteria are a strong consid-
eration. For each chapter, there are a number of sections, each one describing a
best practice. There is a brief description of the problems it can fix, as well as notes
on how it can be implemented, and any problems one may encounter while doing so.
Each chapter concludes with a section that describes the impact of a recommended
mix of best practices on the functional area being covered. This last section


Introduction 3

almost always includes a graphical representation of how certain best practices
impact specific activities. Not all the best practices in each chapter are included in
this graphic, since some are mutually exclusive. This chapter layout is designed
to give the reader a quick overview of the best practices that are most likely to
make a significant impact on a functional area of the accounting department.

The book ends with Appendix A. It lists all of the best practices in each of the
preceding chapters. This list allows the reader to quickly find a potentially useful
best practice. It is then a simple matter to refer back to the main text to obtain
more information about each item.

This book is designed to assist anyone who needs to improve either the effi-
ciency of the accounting department, reduce its error rates, or provide better
information to other parts of a company. The best practices noted on the follow-
ing pages will greatly assist in attaining this goal, which may be part of a grand
strategic vision or simply a desire by an accounting manager to improve the
department. The layout of the book is extremely practical: to list as many best
practices as possible, to assist the reader in finding the most suitable ones, and to
describe any implementation problems that may arise. In short, this is the perfect
do-it-yourself fix-it book for the manager who likes to tinker with the accounting
department.


Chapter 2

 

How to Use Best Practices

This chapter is about implementing best practices. It begins by describing the
various kinds of best practices and goes on to cover those situations where they
are most likely to be installed successfully. The key components of a successful
best practice installation are also noted. When planning to add a best practice, it
is also useful to know the ways in which the implementation can fail, so there is a
lengthy list of reasons for failure. Finally, there is a brief discussion of the impact
of change on employees and the organization. Only by carefully considering all
of these issues in advance can one hope to achieve a successful best practice
implementation that will result in increased levels of efficiency in the accounting
department.

TYPES OF BEST PRACTICES

This section describes the two main types of best practices, each one requiring
considerably different implementation approaches.

The first type of best practice is an incremental one. This usually involves
either a small modification to an existing procedure or a replacement of a proce-
dure that is so minor in effect that it has only a minimal impact on the organiza-
tion, or indeed on the person who performs the procedure. The increased level of
efficiency contributed by a single best practice of this type is moderate at best,
but this type is also the easiest to install, since there is little resistance from the
organization. An example of this type of best practice is using a signature stamp
to sign checks (see Chapter 3); it is simple, cuts a modest amount of time from
the check preparation process, and there will be no complaints about its use.
However, only when this type of best practice is used in large numbers is there a
significant increase in the level of efficiency of accounting operations.

The second type of best practice involves a considerable degree of reengi-
neering. This requires the complete reorganization or replacement of an existing
function. The level of change is massive, resulting in employees either being laid
off or receiving vastly different job descriptions. The level of efficiency improve-
ment can be several times greater than the old method it is replacing. However, the
level of risk matches the reward, for this type of best practice meets with enor-
mous resistance and consequently is at great risk of failure. An example of this
type of best practice is eliminating the accounts payable department in favor of


The Most Fertile Ground for Best Practices 5

having the receiving staff approve all payments at the receiving dock (see Chapter
3); it involves the elimination of many jobs and is an entirely new approach to pay-
ing suppliers. A single best practice implementation of this sort can reap major
improvements in the level of accounting efficiency.

Thus, given the considerable number and size of the differences between the
incremental and reengineering best practices, it is necessary to first determine
into which category a best practice falls before designing a plan for implementing
it. Given the difficulty of implementation for a reengineering project, it may even
be necessary to delay implementation or intersperse a series of such projects with
easier incremental projects, in order to allow employees to recover from the
reengineering projects.

THE MOST FERTILE GROUND FOR BEST PRACTICES

Before installing any best practice, it is useful to review the existing environment
to see if there is a reasonable chance for the implementation to succeed. The fol-
lowing bullet points note the best environments in which best practices can not
only be installed, but also have a fair chance of continuing to succeed:

¢ If benchmarking shows a problem. Some organizations regularly compare
their performance levels against those of other companies, especially those
with a reputation for having extremely high levels of performance. If there is
a significant difference in the performance levels of these other organizations
and the company doing the benchmarking, this can serve as a reminder that
continuous change is necessary in order to survive. If management sees and
heeds this warning, the environment in which best practices will be accepted
is greatly improved.

¢ If management has a change orientation. Some managers have a seemingly
genetic disposition toward change. If an accounting department has such a
person in charge, there will certainly be a drive toward many changes. If any-
thing, this type of person can go too far, implementing too many projects
with not enough preparation, resulting in a confused operations group whose
newly revised systems may take a considerable amount of time to untangle.
The presence of a detail-oriented second-in-command is very helpful for
preserving order and channeling the energies of such a manager into the
most productive directions.

¢ Ifthe company is experiencing poor financial results. If there is a significant
loss, or a trend in that direction, this serves as a wake-up call to management,
which in turn results in the creation of a multitude of best practices projects.
In this case, the situation may even go too far, with so many improvement
projects going on at once that there are not enough resources to go around,
resulting in the ultimate completion of few, if any, of the best practices.


How to Use Best Practices

If there is new management. Most people who are newly installed as managers
of either the accounting department or (better yet) the entire organization
want to make changes in order to leave their marks on the organization. Though
this can involve less effective practice items like organizational changes or a
new strategic direction, it is possible that there will be a renewed focus on
efficiency that will result in the implementation of new best practices.

In short, as long as there is a willingness by management to change and a good
reason for doing so, then there is fertile ground for the implementation of a mul-
titude of best practices.

PLANNING FOR BEST PRACTICES

A critical issue for the success of any best practices implementation project is an
adequate degree of advance planning. The following bullet points describe the
key components of a typical best practices implementation plan:

Capacity requirements. Any project plan must account for the amount of
capacity needed to ensure success. Capacity can include the number of people,
computers, or floor space that is needed. For example, if the project team
requires 20 people, then there must be a planning item to find and equip a
sufficient amount of space for this group. Also, a project that requires a con-
siderable amount of programming time should reserve that time in advance
with the programming staff to ensure that the programming is completed on
time. Also, the management team must have a sufficient amount of time
available to properly oversee the project team’s activities. If any of these
issues are not addressed in advance, there can be a major impact on the suc-
cess of the implementation.

Common change calendar. If there are many best practices being imple-
mented at the same time, there is a high risk that resources scheduled for one
project will not be available for other projects. For example, a key software
developer may receive independent requests from multiple project teams to
develop software, and cannot satisfy all the requests. To avoid this, one
should use a single change calendar, so that planned changes can be seen in
the context of other changes being planned. The calendar should be examined
for conflicts every time a change is made to it, and also be made available for
general review, so that all project teams can consult it whenever needed.

Contingencies. Murphy’s Law always applies, so there should be contingen-
cies built into the project plan. For example, if the project team is being set
up in a new building, there is always a chance that phone lines will not be
installed in time. To guard against this possibility, there should be an addi-
tional project step to obtain some cellular phones, which will supply the
team’s communications needs until the phone lines can be installed.


Planning for Best Practices 7

¢ Dependencies. The steps required to complete a project must be properly
sequenced so that any bottleneck steps are clearly defined and have sufficient
resources allocated to them to ensure that they are completed on time. For
example, a project planning person cannot set up the plan if there is no pro-
ject planning software available and loaded into the computer. Consequently,
this step must be completed before the planning task can commence.

¢ Funding requirements. Any project requires some funding, such as the pur-
chase of equipment for the project team or software licenses or employee
training. Consequently, the project plan must include the dates on which fund-
ing is expected, so that dependent tasks involving the expenditure of those
funds can be properly planned.

¢ Review points. For all but the smallest projects, there must be control points
at which the project manager has a formal review meeting with those people
who are responsible for certain deliverables. These review points must be
built into the plan, along with a sufficient amount of time for follow-up meet-
ings to resolve any issues that may arise during the initial review meetings.

¢ Risk levels. Some best practices, especially those involving a large propor-
tion of reengineering activities, run a considerable risk of failure. In these
cases, it is necessary to conduct a careful review of what will happen if the
project fails. For example, can the existing system be reinstituted if the new
system does not work? What if funding runs out? What if management sup-
port for the project falters? What if the level of technology is too advanced
for the company to support? The answers to these questions may result in
additional project steps to safeguard the project, or to at least back it up with
a contingency plan in case the project cannot reach a successful conclusion.

¢ Total time required. All of the previous planning steps are influenced by one
of the most important considerations of all—how much time is allocated to
the project. Though there may be some play in the final project due date, it is
always unacceptable to let a project run too long, since it ties up the time of
project team members and will probably accumulate extra costs until it is
completed. Consequently, the project team must continually revise the exist-
ing project plan to account for new contingencies and problems as they arise,
given the overriding restriction of the amount of time available.

The elements of planning that have just been described will all go for naught if
there is not an additional linkage to corporate strategy at the highest levels. The
reason is that although an implementation may be completely successful, it may
not make any difference, and even be rendered unusable, if corporate strategy
calls for a shift that will render the best practice obsolete. For example, a fine
new centralized accounts payable facility for the use of all corporate divisions is
not of much use if the general corporate direction is to spin off or sell all of
those divisions. Thus, proper integration of low-level best practices planning


8 How to Use Best Practices

with high-level corporate planning is required to ensure that the correct projects
are completed.

Given the large number of issues to resolve in order to give an implementa-
tion project a reasonable chance of success, it is apparent that the presence of a
manager who is very experienced in the intricacies of project planning is a key
component of an effective project team. Consequently, the acquisition of such a
person should be one of the first steps to include in a project plan.

This section described in general terms the key components of a project plan
that must be considered in order to foresee where problems may arise in the
course of an implementation. We now proceed to a discussion of the impact of
time on the success of a best practices implementation.

TIMING OF BEST PRACTICES

Both the timing of a best practice implementation and the time it takes to com-
plete it have a major impact on the likelihood of success.

The timing of an implementation project is critical. For example, an installa-
tion that comes at the same time as a major deliverable in another area will
receive scant attention from the person who is most responsible for using the best
practice, since it takes a distant second place to the deliverable. Also, any project
that comes on the heels of a disastrous implementation will not be expected to
succeed, though this problem can be overcome by targeting a quick and easy pro-
ject that results in a rapid success—and that overcomes the stigma of the earlier
failure. Further, proper implementation timing must take into account other pro-
ject implementations going on elsewhere in the company or even in the same
department, so that there is not a conflict over project resources. Only by care-
fully considering these issues prior to scheduling a project will a best practice
implementation not be impacted by timing issues.

In addition to timing, the time required to complete a project is of major
importance. A quick project brings with it the aura of success, a reputation for
completion, and a much better chance of being allowed to take on a more diffi-
cult and expensive project. Alternatively, a project that impacts lots of depart-
ments or people, or that involves the liberal application of cutting-edge technol-
ogy, runs a major risk of running for a long time; and the longer the project, the
greater the risk that something will go wrong, objections will arise, or that
funding will run out. Thus, close attention to project duration will increase the
odds of success.

IMPLEMENTING BEST PRACTICES

The actual implementation of any best practice requires a great degree of careful
planning, as noted earlier. However, planning is not enough. The implementation


Implementing Best Practices 9

process itself requires a number of key components in order to ensure a success-
ful conclusion. This section discusses those components.

One of the first implementation steps for all but the simplest best practice
improvements is to study and flowchart the existing system about to be improved.
By doing so, one can ascertain any unusual requirements that are not readily
apparent and that must be included in the planning for the upcoming implementa-
tion. Though some reengineering efforts do not spend much time on this task, on
the grounds that the entire system is about to be replaced, the same issue still
applies—there are usually special requirements, unique to any company, that
must be addressed in any new system. Accordingly, nearly all implementation
projects must include this critical step.

Another issue is the cost-benefit analysis. This is a compilation of all the
costs required to both install and maintain a best practice, which is offset against
the benefits of doing so. These costs must include project team payroll and
related expenses, outside services, programming costs, training, travel, and capi-
tal expenditures. This step is worth a great deal of attention, for a wise manager
will not undertake a new project, no matter how cutting-edge and high-profile it
may be, if there is not a sound analysis in place that clearly shows the benefit of
moving forward with it.

Yet another implementation issue is the use of new technology. Though there
may be new devices or software on the market that can clearly improve the effi-
ciency of a company’s operations, and perhaps even make a demonstrative impact
on a company’s competitive situation, it still may be more prudent to wait until
the technology has been tested in the marketplace for a short time before pro-
ceeding with an implementation. This is a particular problem if there is only one
supplier available that offers the technology, especially if that supplier is a small
one or with inadequate funding, with the attendant risk of going out of business.
In most cases, the prudent manager will elect to use technology that has proven
itself in the marketplace, rather than using the most cutting-edge applications.

Of great importance to most best practice implementations is system testing.
Any new application, unless it is astoundingly simple, carries with it the risk of
failure. This risk must be tested repeatedly to ensure that it will not occur under
actual use. The type of testing can take a variety of forms. One is volume testing,
to ensure that a large number of employees using the system at the same time will
not result in failure. Another is feature testing, in which test transactions that test
the boundaries of the possible information to be used are run through the system.
Yet another possibility is recovery testing—bringing down a computer system
suddenly to see how easy it is to restart the system. All of these approaches, or
others, depending on the type of best practice, should be completed before
unleashing a new application on employees.

One of the last implementation steps before firing up a new best practice is to
provide training to employees in how to run the new system. This must be done
as late as possible, since employee retention of this information will dwindle
rapidly if not reinforced by actual practice. In addition, this training should be


10 How to Use Best Practices

hands-on whenever possible, since employees retain the most information when
training is conducted in this manner. It is important to identify in advance all pos-
sible users of a new system for training, since a few untrained employees can
result in the failure of a new best practice.

A key element of any training class is procedures. These must be completed,
reviewed, and be made available for employee use not only at the time of train-
ing, but also at all times thereafter, which requires a good manager to oversee the
procedure creation and distribution phases. Procedure-writing is a special skill
that may require the hiring of technical writers, interviewers, and systems ana-
lysts to ensure that procedures are properly crafted. The input of users into the
accuracy of all procedures is also an integral step in this process.

Even after the new system has been installed, it is necessary to conduct a
post-implementation review. This analysis determines if the cost savings or effi-
ciency improvements are in the expected range, what problems arose during the
implementation that should be avoided during future projects, and what issues are
still unresolved from the current implementation. This last point is particularly
important, for many managers do not follow through completely on all the stray
implementation issues, which inevitably arise after a new system is put in place.
Only by carefully listing these issues and working through them will the employ-
ees using the new system be completely satisfied with how a best practice has
been installed.

An issue that arises during all phases of a project implementation is commu-
nications. Since there may be a wide range of activities going on, many of them
dependent upon each other, it is important that the status of all project steps be
continually communicated to the entire project team, as well as to all affected
employees. By doing so, a project manager can avoid such gaffes as having one
task proceed without knowing that, due to changes elsewhere in the project, the
entire task has been rendered unnecessary. These communications should not just
be limited to project plan updates, but should also include all meeting minutes in
which changes are decided on, documented, and approved by team leaders. By
paying attention to this important item at every step of an implementation, the
entire process will be completed much more smoothly.

As described in this section, a successful best practice implementation nearly
always includes a review of the current system, a cost-benefit analysis, responsi-
ble use of new technology, system testing, training, and a post-implementation
review, with a generous dash of communications at every step.

BEST PRACTICE DUPLICATION

It can be a particularly difficult challenge to duplicate a successful best practice
when opening a new company facility, especially if expansion is contemplated in
many locations over a short time period. The difficulty with best practice duplica-
tion is that employees in the new locations are typically given a brief overview of


Why Best Practices Fail 11

a best practice and told to “go do it.’ Under this scenario, they have only a
sketchy idea of what they are supposed to do, and so create a process that varies
in some key details from the baseline situation. To make matters worse, managers
at the new location may feel that they can create a better best practice from the
start, and so create something that differs in key respects from the baseline. For
both reasons, the incidence of best practice duplication failure is high.

To avoid these problems, a company should first be certain that it has accu-
mulated all possible knowledge about a functioning best practice—the forms,
policies, procedures, equipment, and special knowledge required to make it work
properly —and then transfer this information into a concise document that can be
shared with new locations. Second, a roving team of expert users must be com-
missioned to visit all new company locations and personally install the new sys-
tems, thereby ensuring that the proper level of experience with a best practice is
brought to bear on a duplication activity. Finally, a company should transfer the
practitioners of best practices to new locations on a semipermanent basis to
ensure that the necessary knowledge required to make a best practice effective
over the long term remains on-site. By taking these steps, a company can increase
its odds of spreading best practices throughout all of its locations.

A special issue is the tendency of a new company location to attempt to
enhance a copied best practice at the earliest opportunity. This tendency fre-
quently arises from the belief that one can always improve upon something that
was created elsewhere. However, these changes may negatively impact other
parts of the company’s systems, resulting in an overall reduction in performance.
Consequently, it is better to insist that new locations duplicate a best practice in
all respects and use it to match the performance levels of the baseline location
before they are allowed to make any changes to it. By doing so, the new location
must take the time to fully utilize the best practice and learn its intricacies before
they can modify it.

WHY BEST PRACTICES FAIL

There is a lengthy list of reasons why a best practice installation may not suc-
ceed, as noted in the following bullet points. The various reasons for failure can
be grouped into a relatively small cluster of primary reasons. The first is lack of
planning, which can include inadequate budgeting for time, money, or personnel.
Another is the lack of cooperation by other entities, such as the programming
staff or other departments that will be impacted by any changes. The final, and
most important, problem is that there is little or no effort made to prepare the
organization for change. This last item tends to build up over time as more and
more best practices are implemented, eventually resulting in the total resistance
by the organization to any further change. At its root, this problem involves a fun-
damental lack of communication, especially to those people who are most
impacted by change. When a single implementation is completed without


12 How to Use Best Practices

informing all employees of the change, this may be tolerated, but a continuous
stream of them will encourage a revolt. In alphabetical order, the various causes
of failure are noted as follows:

¢ Alterations to packaged software. A very common cause of failure is that a
best practice requires changes to a software package provided by a software
supplier; after the changes are made, the company finds that the newest
release of the software contains features that it must have and so it updates
the software—wiping out the programming changes that were made to
accommodate the best practice. This problem can also arise even if there is
only a custom interface between the packaged software and some other
application needed for a best practice, because a software upgrade may alter
the data accessed through the interface. Thus, alterations to packaged soft-
ware are doomed to failure unless there is absolutely no way that the com-
pany will ever update the software package.

* Custom programming. A major cause of implementation failure is that the
programming required to make it a reality either does not have the requested
specifications, costs more than expected, arrives too late, is unreliable—or
all of the above! Since many best practices are closely linked to the latest
advances in technology, this is an increasingly common cause of failure. To
keep from being a victim of programming problems, one should never
attempt to implement the most “‘bleeding-edge” technology, because it is the
most subject to failure. Instead, wait for some other company to work out all
of the bugs and make it a reliable concept, and then proceed with the imple-
mentation. Also, it is useful to interview other people who have gone through
a complete installation to see what tips they can give that will result in a
smoother implementation. Finally, one should always interview any other
employees who have had programming work done for them by the in-house
staff. If the results of these previous efforts were not acceptable, it may be
better to look outside of the company for more competent programming
assistance.

¢ Inadequate preparation of the organization. Communication is the key to a
successful implementation. Alternatively, no communication keeps an orga-
nization from understanding what is happening; this increases the rumors
about a project, builds resistance to it, and reduces the level of cooperation
that people are likely to give to it. Avoiding this issue requires a considerable
amount of up-front communication about the intentions and likely impact of
any project, with that communication targeted not just at the impacted man-
agers, but also at all impacted employees, and to some extent even the corpo-
ration or department as a whole.

¢ Intransigent personnel. A major cause of failure is the employee who either

refuses to use a best practice or who actively tries to sabotage it. This type of
person may have a vested interest in using the old system, does not like


Why Best Practices Fail 13

change in general, or has a personality clash with someone on the implemen-
tation team. In any of these cases, the person must be won over through good
communication (especially if the employee is in a controlling position) or
removed to a position that has no impact on the project. If neither of these
actions is successful, the project will almost certainly fail.

¢ Lack of control points. One of the best ways to maintain control over any
project is to set up regular review meetings, as well as additional meetings to
review the situation when preset milestone targets are reached. These meetings
are designed to see how a project is progressing, to discuss any problems that
have occurred or are anticipated, and to determine how current or potential
problems can best be avoided. Without the benefit of these regular meetings,
it is much more likely that unexpected problems will arise, or that existing
ones will be exacerbated.

¢ Lack of funding. A project can be canceled either because it has a significant
cost overrun that exceeds the original funding request or because it was ini-
tiated without any funding request in the first place. Either approach results
in failure. Besides the obvious platitude of “don’t go over budget,” the best
way to avoid this problem is to build a cushion into the original funding
request that should see the project through, barring any unusually large
extra expenditures.

¢ Lack of planning. A critical aspect of any project is the planning that goes
into it. If there is no plan, there is no way to determine the cost, number of
employees, or time requirements, nor is there any formal review of the inher-
ent project risks. Without this formal planning process, a project is very
likely to hit a snag or be stopped cold at some point prior to its timely com-
pletion. On the contrary, using proper planning results in a smooth imple-
mentation process that builds a good reputation for the project manager and
thereby leads to more funding for additional projects.

¢ Lack of post-implementation review. Though it is not a criterion for the suc-
cessful implementation of any single project, a missing post-implementation
review can cause the failure of later projects. For example, if such a review
reveals that a project was completed in spite of the inadequate project plan-
ning skills of a specific manager, it might be best to use a different person in
the future for new projects, thereby increasing his or her chances of success.

¢ Lack of success in earlier efforts. If a manager builds a reputation for not
successfully completing best practices projects, it becomes increasingly dif-
ficult to complete new ones. The problem is that no one believes that a new
effort will succeed and so there is little commitment to doing it. Also, upper
management is much less willing to allocate funds to a manager who has not
developed a proven track record for successful implementations. The best
way out of this jam is to assign a different manager to an implementation
project, one with a proven track record of success.


14

How to Use Best Practices

Lack of testing. A major problem for the implementation of especially large
and complex projects, especially those involving programming, is that they
are rushed into production without a thorough testing process to discover
and correct all bugs that might interfere with or freeze the orderly conduct
of work in the areas they are designed to improve. There is nothing more
dangerous than to install a wonderful new system in a critical area of the
company, only to see that critical function fail completely due to a problem
that could have been discovered in a proper testing program. It is always
worthwhile to build some extra time into a project budget for an adequate
amount of testing.

Lack of top management support. If a project requires a large amount of
funding or the cooperation of multiple departments, it is critical to have the
complete support of the top management team. If not, any required funding
may not be allocated, while there is also a strong possibility that any object-
ing departments will be able to sidetrack it easily. This is an especially com-
mon problem when the project has no clear project sponsor at all—without a
senior-level manager to drive it, a project will sputter along and eventually
fade away without coming anywhere near completion.

Relying on other departments. As soon as another department’s cooperation
becomes a necessary component of a best practice installation, the chances
of success drop markedly. The odds become even smaller if multiple depart-
ments are involved. The main reason is that there is now an extra manager
involved, who may not have the commitment of the accounting manager to
make the implementation a success. In addition, the staff of the other depart-
ment may influence their manager not to help out, while there may also be a
problem with the other department not having a sufficient amount of funding
to complete its share of the work. For example, an accounting department
can benefit greatly at period-end if the warehouse is using cycle-counting to
keep inventory accuracy levels high, since there is no need for a physical
inventory count. However, if the warehouse does not have the extra staff
available to count inventory, the work will not be done, no matter how badly
the accounting staff wants to implement this best practice.

Too many changes in a short time. An organization will rebel against too
much change if it is clustered into a short time frame. The reason is that
change is unsettling, especially when it involves a large part of people’s job
descriptions, so that nearly everything they do is altered. This can result in
direct employee resistance to further change, sabotaging new projects, a work
slowdown, or (quite likely) the departure of the most disgruntled workers.
This problem is best solved by planning for lapses between implementation
projects to let the employees settle down. The best way to accomplish this
lag between changes without really slowing down the overall schedule of
implementation is to shift projects around in the accounting department, so
that no functional area is on the receiving end of two consecutive projects.


The Impact of Best Practices on Employees 15

The primary reason for listing all of these causes of failure is not to discourage
the reader from ever attempting a best practice installation. On the contrary, this
allows one to prepare for and avoid all roadblocks on the path to ultimate imple-
mentation success.

THE IMPACT OF BEST PRACTICES ON EMPLOYEES

The impact of best practices on employees is significant. In the short run, there
is an overwhelming feeling of discontent, because any kind of change makes
employees nervous about what the impact will be on their jobs. Admittedly, a
primary purpose of using best practices is to reduce the payroll expense in
the accounting department, or at least to handle an increased workload with
the same number of employees. Consequently, employees have a reason to be
concerned.

There are several ways to deal with employee concerns. One is to create a
standard policy of rolling all displaced employees onto a project team that will
be used to implement even more best practices. This approach tends to attract
the best employees to the project team, but also has the disadvantage of eventu-
ally displacing so many employees that there are too many people staffing the
implementation team. The opposite approach is to be up-front about projected
changes to employee jobs and to give a generous amount of both notice and sev-
erance pay to those people who will be displaced. Given the realities of paying
extra money to departing employees and the need for well-staffed implementa-
tion teams, the recommended approach is somewhere in the middle—to retain a
few of the best employees to run new projects, which reduces the amount of sev-
erance that must be paid out to departing employees.

The other problem, which is more of a long-run issue, is communications.
Even after the initial round of layoffs, there will be a continued emphasis on con-
stantly improving the accounting department’s processes. These changes cannot
take place in a vacuum. Instead, the implementation team must carefully research
the costs and benefits of each prospective best practice, discuss the issue with
those employees who are most knowledgeable about how any changes will
impact the organization as a whole, and rely to a considerable extent on their
advice in regard to whether there should be any implementation at all, and if so,
how the best practice should be modified to fit the organization’s particular cir-
cumstances. Only by making the maximum use of employees’ knowledge and by
paying close attention to their opinions and fears can an implementation team
continually succeed in installing a series of best practices.

Thus, communication is the key—both in handling employee departures in
the short term, while the accounting department is reducing its staffing levels to
match greater levels of efficiency, and in the long run, when employee coopera-
tion is crucial to continued success.

SUMMARY

This chapter has given an overview of the situations in which best practices
implementations are most likely to succeed, what factors are most important to
the success or failure of an implementation, and how to successfully create and
follow through on an implementation project. By following the recommendations
made in this chapter, not only those regarding how to implement, but also those
regarding what not to do, a manager will have a much higher chance of success.
With this information in hand, one can now confidently peruse the remaining
chapters, which are full of best practices. The reader will be able to select those
practices having the best chance of a successful implementation, based on the
specific circumstances pertaining to each manager, such as the funding, time
available, and any obstacles, such as entrenched employees or a corporate intran-
sigence pertaining to new projects.

Accounts Payable
Best Practices

The accounts payable function is the most labor-intensive of all the accounting
functions and is therefore an excellent source of labor savings if the correct best
practices can be implemented. The basic process in most companies is to receive
three types of information from three sources—an invoice from the supplier, a pur-
chase order from the purchasing department, and a proof of receipt from the receiving
department. The accounts payable staff then matches all three documents to ensure
that a prospective payment is authorized and that the underlying goods have been
received, and then pays the bill. The process is labor-intensive partially because
there is such a large amount of matching to do, but also because the three docu-
ments almost never match. Either the purchase order quantities or prices do not
match what the supplier is charging, or else the amount received does not match the
quantities on the other two documents. Because of these inaccuracies, the amount
of labor required to issue a payment can be extraordinarily high.

The best practices in this chapter fall into a few main categories, most of them
designed to reduce the matching work. One category attempts to consolidate the
number of invoices arriving from suppliers, thereby shrinking the paperwork
from this source—typical best practices in this area are using procurement cards
and shrinking the number of suppliers. Another category tries to reduce or elimi-
nate the number of receiving documents. Typical best practices in this area are
substituting occasional audits for ongoing matching of receiving documents, as
well as directly entering receipts into the computer system. Finally, another cate-
gory reduces the number of purchase orders that must be matched. Typical best
practices in this area include using blanket purchase orders and automating three-
way matching. Other solutions to the matching problem involve going away from
the traditional matching process entirely, by using payments based solely on
proof of receipt. It is not possible to use all of these best practices together, since
some are mutually exclusive—one must be careful in choosing the correct best
practices.

Lastly, a number of best practices focus on the overall accounts payable
process, attempting to either shrink or automate the number of steps required
before a company issues payment to a supplier. Examples of best practices in this
area include using a signature stamp and switching to wire transfers.

The number of best practices in the accounts payable area indicates that this
function is ripe for improvements. However, some best practices require a large

17

investment of money or time, as noted in the chart in the next section, so the person
doing the improving should verify that resources are available before embarking on
an implementation.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES FOR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE
BEST PRACTICES

This section notes a number of issues related to the implementation of each best
practice. The reader should peruse Exhibit 3.1 to ensure that the effort required to
install a best practice is in agreement with the available constraints. For example,
automating expense reporting is listed as requiring a long implementation period
and being moderately expensive (all because of the programming required). If the
reader has a large staff of traveling employees who constantly submit expense
reports, this may be a viable option, despite the projected implementation barriers.
However, if only a few expense reports are submitted, then perhaps this is a best
practice that should be passed over in favor of more practical opportunities.

Exhibit 3.1 lists all of the best practices in this chapter. Next to the best
practices are ratings for estimates of the cost to completely install each best
practice. The last column shows the duration of implementation, which can be
an issue for anyone looking for quick results. Any large programming projects
are assumed to have long implementation durations.

One should be careful to select only “quick hits” from Exhibit 3.1. Though
these best practices are certainly worth the effort of installing, it is important to
remember that some of the most difficult items on the list can have the largest
payback. Accordingly, it is best to review the list in detail and assemble a set of
best practices that provide for a combination of quick and easy victories, while
also allowing for solid, long-term improvements that will impact the accounts
payable function’s levels of efficiency and effectiveness.

The accounts payable process is one of the most convoluted of all the processes
that a company can adopt, irrespective of the department. First, it requires the
collection of information from multiple departments—purchase orders from the
purchasing department, invoices from suppliers, and receiving documents from
the receiving department. The process then involves matching these documents,
which almost always contain exceptions, and then tracking down someone either
to approve exceptions or at least to sign the checks, which must then be mailed to
suppliers. The key to success in this area is to thoroughly reengineer the entire
process by eliminating the paperwork, the multiple sources of information, and

the additional approvals. The only best practice that truly addresses the underly-
ing problems of the accounts payable process is paying based on receipt.

To pay based on receipt, one must first do away with the concept of having an
accounts payable staff that performs the traditional matching process. Instead, the
receiving staff checks to see if there is a purchase order at the time of receipt. If
there is, the computer system automatically pays the supplier. Sounds simple? It is
not. A company must have several features installed before the concept will func-
tion properly. The main issue is having a computer terminal at the receiving dock.
When a supplier shipment arrives, a receiving person takes the purchase order
number and quantity received from the shipping documentation and punches it
into the computer. The computer system will check against an on-line database of
open purchase orders to see if the shipment was authorized. If so, the system will
automatically schedule a payment to the supplier based on the purchase order
price, which can be sent by wire transfer. If the purchase order number is not in the
database, or if there is no purchase order number at all, the shipment is rejected at
the receiving dock. Note that the accounts payable staff takes no part whatsoever
in this process— everything has been shifted to a simple step at the receiving loca-
tion. The process is shown graphically in Exhibit 3.2.

Before laying off the entire accounts payable staff and acquiring such a sys-
tem, there are several problems to overcome. They are as follows:

¢ Train suppliers. Every supplier who sends anything to a company must be
trained to include the purchase order number, the company’s part number,
and the quantity shipped on the shipping documentation, so this information
can be punched into the computer at the receiving location. The information
can be encoded as bar codes to make the data-entry task easier for the receiv-
ing employees. Training a supplier may be difficult, especially if the com-
pany only purchases a small quantity of goods from the supplier. To make it
worthwhile for the supplier to go to this extra effort, it may be necessary to
concentrate purchases with a smaller number of suppliers to give each one a
significant volume of orders.

¢ Alter the accounting system. The traditional accounting software is not
designed to allow approvals at the receiving dock. Accordingly, a company
will have to reprogram the system to allow the reengineered process to be
performed. This can be an exceptionally major undertaking, especially if the
software is constantly being upgraded by the supplier—every upgrade will
wipe out any custom programming that the company may have created.

¢ Prepare for miscellaneous payments. The accounts payable department will
not really go away because there will always be stray supplier invoices of
various kinds arriving for payment that cannot possibly go through the receiving
dock, such as subscription payments, utility bills, and repair invoices. Accord-
ingly, the old payments system must still be maintained, though at a greatly
reduced level, to handle these items.

¢ Pay without a supplier invoice. One of the key aspects of the reengineered
process is paying based on the information in the purchase order, rather than
the information in the supplier’s invoice. To do so, one must have a database
of all the tax rates that every supplier would charge, so that the company’s
computer system can automatically include these taxes in the invoice pay-
ments. Also, there will sometimes be discrepancies between the purchase
order prices and quantities paid, versus those expected by suppliers, so an
accounts payable staff must be kept on hand to correspond with suppliers to

reconcile these issues.


3-2 Reduce Required Approvals 23

The preceding bullet points reveal that there are a wide array of problems
that must first be overcome before the dramatic improvements of this new
process can be realized. However, for a company that has a large accounts
payable staff, this can be a highly rewarding system to install, for the savings
realized can be the elimination of the majority of the accounts payable depart-
ment.

3-2 REDUCE REQUIRED APPROVALS V Author’s Choice

The accounts payable process is typically a long one. Part of the problem is that
many accounting systems require a manager’s signature (or those of several man-
agers!) on a supplier invoice before it can be paid. Though it is reasonable to have
such a requirement if there is no purchase order for the invoice, many systems
require the signature even if there is already a purchase order (which is, in effect,
a form of prior approval). Also, most accounting systems require a manager’s sig-
nature on unapproved invoices, no matter how small the invoice may be. The
result of these common approval procedures is that the accounts payable staff
delivers invoices to managers for signatures and then waits until the documents
are returned before proceeding further with the payment process. If the manager
is not available to sign an invoice, then it sits; if the manager loses the invoice (a
common occurrence), the invoice is never paid, resulting in an angry supplier
who must send a fresh copy of the invoice for a second pass through the dangerous
shoals of the company’s approval process. This is a clearly inefficient process,
both lengthy and likely to annoy suppliers. What can be done?

A superb best practice for any company to implement is to limit approvals to
a single event or document and, wherever possible, to limit this approval to a
period prior to the receipt of the supplier invoice. For example, an authorized sig-
nature on a purchase order should be sufficient overall approval to pay an invoice.
After all, if the signature was good enough to authorize the initial purchase of the
item or service, shouldn’t the same signature be sufficient approval for the pay-
ment of the supplier’s bill? In addition, by shifting the approval to the purchase
order, we avoid having the accounts payable staff track down someone after the
supplier’s invoice has been received, which effectively chops time from the overall
accounts payable process. Another variation is to use a signature on the purchase
requisition, which comes before the purchase order. As long as either document is
signed by an authorized person and sent to the accounts payable staff in advance,
it does not matter which document is used as authorization. The key is to use a single
authorization, before the supplier sends an invoice.

One reason why so many companies require multiple approvals, both at the
time of purchasing and at the time of payment, is that they do not have a suffi-
cient degree of control over the authorization process. For example, there may not


24 Accounts Payable Best Practices

be any real check of authorization signatures when purchase requisitions are con-
verted into purchase orders, nor might there be any required signature when pur-
chase orders are issued to suppliers. In addition, the signature stamp used to sign
checks may not be properly controlled. In all these cases, if there were tight control
over the authorization used, there would only be a need for a single authorization.
For example, there should be an audit of all purchase orders to ensure that every
one of them has been signed, that every signature is by an authorized person, and
that the person signing is authorized to purchase what was ordered. This level of
control requires continual internal audits to ensure that the control point is working,
as well as continual follow-up and training of employees so that they know pre-
cisely how the control system is supposed to work. Only by instituting this degree
of control over authorizations can a company reduce the number of approvals to a
minimum.

Using tight control over approvals that are given early in the accounts payable
process results in a shorter processing cycle and fewer delays.

3-3 USE NEGATIVE ASSURANCE FOR
INVOICE APPROVALS WV Author’s Choice

One of the most significant problems for the accounts payable staff is the contin-
uing delay in receiving approvals of supplier invoices from authorized employees
throughout the company. Invoices tend to sit on employee desks as low-priority
items, resulting in constant reminders by the accounting staff to turn in docu-
ments, as well as late payments and missed early-payment discounts.

This universal problem can be avoided through the use of negative assur-
ance. Under this approval system, invoice copies are sent to authorizing employ-
ees, and are automatically paid when due unless the employees tell the accounts
payable staff not to issue payment. By focusing only on those invoices that may
be incorrect, the accounting staff can process the vast majority of all submitted
invoices without cajoling anyone to submit an approved document.

The process can be streamlined even further by digitizing an incoming
invoice and e-mailing it to the authorizing employee. By doing so, employees can
be reached even when they are off-site, as long as they check their e-mail on a
regular basis. By linking these transmissions to workflow software, the account-
ing staff can designate how long an invoice can wait in a recipient’s e-mail box
before it is automatically routed to another authorized person, thereby ensuring
that someone will see every invoice and raise a red flag if a potential problem
exists.

3-4 Use Procurement Cards 25

3-4 USE PROCUREMENT CARDS V Author's Choice

Consider the number of work steps required to process a payment to a supplier:
receiving paperwork, sorting and matching it, entering data into a computer, rout-
ing invoices through the organization for approvals, expediting those invoices
that have early-payment discounts, creating month-end accruals, setting up files
on new suppliers in the computer and the filing system, processing checks,
obtaining check signatures, mailing payments, and filing away check copies.
Now consider how many purchases are so small that the cost of all these activities
exceeds the cost of the purchase. In many instances, one-quarter or more of all
payment transactions fall into this category.

The answer to this problem is not to find a more efficient way to process the
supplier invoices, but to change the way in which these items or services are pur-
chased. Instead of using a purchase order or check to purchase something, one
should instead use a procurement card. A procurement card, also known as a pur-
chasing card, is simply a credit card that has a few extra features. The card is
issued to those people who make frequent purchases, with instructions to keep on
making the same purchases, but to do so with the card. This eliminates the multi-
tude of supplier invoices by consolidating them all into a single monthly credit
card statement.

As there is always a risk of having a user purchase extraneous items with a
credit card, including cash advances or excessively expensive purchases, the pro-
curement card adds a few features to control precisely what is purchased. For exam-
ple, it can have a limitation on the total daily amount purchased, the total amount
purchased per transaction, or the total purchased per month. It may also limit pur-
chases to a specific store or to only those stores that fall into a specific Std Industry
Code (SIC code) category, such as a plumbing supply store and nothing else. These
built-in controls effectively reduce the risk that procurement cards will be misused.

Once the credit card statement arrives, it may be too jumbled, with hundreds
of purchases, to determine the expense accounts to which all the items are to be
charged. To help matters, a company can specify how the credit card statement is
to be sorted by the credit card processing company; it can list expenses by the
location of each purchase, by SIC code, or by dollar amount, as well as by date. It
is even possible to receive an electronic transmission of the credit card statement
so that a company can do its own sorting of expenses. The purchasing limitations
and expense statement changes are the key differences between a regular credit
card and a procurement card.

Another feature provided by those entities that offer procurement cards is
“Level II” data; this includes a supplier’s minority supplier status, incorporated
status, and its tax identification number. Another option to look into when
reviewing the procurement card option is the existence of “Level III’ reporting,
which includes such line-item details as quantities, product codes, product
descriptions, and freight and duty costs—in short, the bulk of the information
needed to maintain a detailed knowledge of exactly what is being bought with a


26 Accounts Payable Best Practices

company’s procurement cards. Most major national suppliers of credit cards can
supply Level II or Level III data.

The American Express Corporate Card has now expanded the range of uses
to which its procurement card can be put, by allowing for the inclusion of many
recurring business expenses, such as long-distance phone bills, Internet services,
monthly parking, wireless phone bills, and office security systems. By having
suppliers send their bills to American Express, the accounts payable staff can
consolidate the quantity of check payments that it must make to a single pay-
ment. American Express also provides a “Summary of Account” that itemizes all
of the business expenses for which payments are being made—which provides
sufficient proof for account auditing purposes.

There are two ways to set up invoices to run through this procurement card.
The first approach is to refer to American Express’s list of existing companies
that are willing to provide this service (which can be obtained from American
Express). The list includes such organizations as AirTouch Cellular, GTE Wire-
less, SkyTel Communications, MCI Worldcom, Sprint, America Online, Brinks
Home Security, Fortune magazine, and the Boston Globe. If the company wants
to add a supplier to this list, it can contact American Express, which will call the
supplier to request a rebilling to it.

One issue with this service is that the company must notify its suppliers if its
American Express card number changes, since they will continue to send their
billings to the old number until otherwise notified. Also, it may take a number of
months to line up a sufficient number of suppliers to see a significant reduction in
the number of checks issued by the accounts payable department.

An alternative service is offered by MasterCard, through its Air Travel Card
MasterCard. This procurement card splits airfare charges from all other charges
made to the card and bills them directly to the company. This makes it easier for
the accounting department to segregate and analyze corporate air travel costs.

Though this best practice may appear to be nirvana to many organizations,
the following issues must be carefully considered in order to ensure that the pro-
gram operates properly:

* Card misuse. When procurement cards are handed out to a large number of
employees, there is always the risk that someone will abuse the privilege and
use up valuable company funds on incorrect or excessive purchases. There are
several ways to either prevent this problem or to reduce its impact. One
approach is to hand out the procurement cards only to the purchasing staff,
who can use them to pay for items for which they would otherwise issue a
purchase order; however, this does not address the large quantity of very
small purchases that other employees may make, so a better approach is a
gradual rollout of procurement cards to those employees who have shown a
continuing pattern of making small purchases. Also, the characteristics of the
procurement card itself can be altered, either by limiting the dollar amount of
purchases per transaction, per time period, or even per department. One can


3-4 Use Procurement Cards 27

also restrict the number of usages per day. An additional method for avoiding
employee misuse of procurement cards is to have them sign an agreement that
describes the sanctions that will be imposed when the cards are misused,
which may include termination. Some mix of these solutions can mitigate the
risk of procurement card abuse.

¢ Spending on special items. The use of a procurement card can actually inter-
fere with existing internal procedures for the purchase of such items, rendering
those systems less efficient. For example, an automated materials planning
system for the inventory can issue purchase orders to suppliers with no manual
intervention; adding inventory items to this situation that were purchased
through a different methodology can interfere with the integrity of the data-
base, requiring more manual reconciliation of inventory quantities. Thus,
procurement cards are not always a good idea when buying inventory items.
Also, capital purchases typically have to go through a detailed review and
approval process before they are acquired; since a procurement card offers an
easy way to buy smaller capital items, it represents a simple way to bypass
the approval process. Thus, they are not a good choice for capital purchases.

¢ Dealing with users of the old system. Some employees will not take to the
new procurement card approach, if only because they are used to the old sys-
tem. This can cause headaches for both the purchasing and accounting
departments, since they must deal with both the old system and the new one
in combination. It may be impossible to completely eliminate the old pur-
chase order system in some cases (if only because of company politics), so a
good alternative is to charge to those departments using the old system the
fully burdened cost of each transaction that does not use a procurement card.
Since this burdened cost, which includes the cost of all the processing steps
noted at the beginning of this section, can easily exceed $100 per transac-
tion, it becomes a very effective way to shift usage toward the procurement
card solution.

¢ Summarizing general ledger accounts. The summary statements that are
received from the credit card processor will not contain as many expense line
items as are probably already contained within a company’s general ledger
(which tends to slice-and-dice expenses down into many categories). For
example, the card statements may only categorize by shop supplies, office
supplies, and shipping supplies. If so, then it is best to alter the general
ledger accounts to match the categories being reported through the procure-
ment cards. This may also require changes to the budgeting system, which
probably mirrors the accounts used in the general ledger.

¢ Purchases from unapproved suppliers. A company may have negotiated
favorable prices from a few select suppliers in exchange for making all of its
purchases for certain items from them. It is a simple matter to ensure that
purchases are made through these suppliers when the purchasing department
is placed in direct control of the buying process. However, once purchases


28

Accounts Payable Best Practices

are put in the hands of anyone with a procurement card, it is much less likely
that the same level of discipline will occur. Instead, purchases will be made
from a much larger group of suppliers. Though not an easy issue to control,
the holders of procurement cards can at least be issued a “preferred supplier
yellow pages,’ which lists those suppliers from whom they should be buy-
ing. Their adherence to this list can be tracked by comparing actual pur-
chases to the yellow pages list and giving them feedback about the issue.

Paying sales and use taxes. Occasionally, a state sales tax auditor will arrive
on a company’s doorstep, demanding to see documentation that proves it has
paid a sales tax on all items purchased. This is not easy to do when procure-
ment cards are used, not only because there may be a multitude of poorly
organized supplier receipts, but also because the sales tax noted on a credit
card payment slip only shows the grand total sales tax paid, rather than the
sales tax for each item purchased; this is an important issue, for some items
are exempt from taxation, which will result in a total sales tax that appears to
be too low in comparison to the total dollar amount of items purchased. One
way to alleviate this problem is to obtain sales tax exemption certificates
from all states with which a company does business; employees then present
the sales tax exemption number whenever they make purchases, so that there
is no doubt at all—no sales taxes have been paid. Then the accounting staff
can calculate the grand total for the use tax (which is the same thing as the
sales tax, except that the purchaser pays it to the state, rather than to the
seller) to pay, and forward this to the appropriate taxing authority. An alter-
native is to “double bag” tax payments, which means that the company pays
the full use tax on all procurement card purchases, without bothering to
spend the time figuring out which sales taxes have already been paid. This is
a safe approach from a tax audit perspective, and may not involve much
additional cost if the total of all procurement card purchases is small. Yet
another alternative is the reverse—to ignore the entire sales tax issue, and
only confront it when audited; this decision is usually based on the level of
risk tolerance of the controller or chief financial officer.

Though the problems noted here must be addressed, one must understand the

significance of the advantages of using procurement cards in order to see why the
problems are minor in relation to the possible benefits. Here are the main attrac-
tions of this best practice:

Fewer accounting transactions. Some of the accounts payable staff may be re-
directed to other tasks, because the number of transactions will drop considerably.

Fewer invoice reviews and signatures. Managers no longer have to review a
considerable number of invoices for payment approval, nor do they have to
sign so many checks addressed to suppliers.


3-5 Automate Three-Way Matching 29

¢ No cash advances. Whenever an employee asks for a cash advance, the account-
ing staff must create a manual check for that person, record it in the accounting
records, and ensure that it is paid back by the employee. This can be a very time-
consuming process in proportion to the generally meager advances given to
employees. A credit card can avoid this entire process, because employees can
go to an automated teller machine and withdraw cash, which will appear in
the next monthly card statement from the issuing bank—no check issuances
required. Of course, this benefit only applies if those employees needing cash
advances are the same ones with access to a procurement card.

¢ Fewer petty-cash transactions. If employees have procurement cards, they will
no longer feel compelled to buy items with their own cash and then ask for a
reimbursement from the company’s petty-cash fund.

¢ Fewer purchasing transactions. A whole range of purchasing activities are
reduced in volume, including contacting suppliers for quotes, creating and
mailing purchase orders, resolving invoicing differences, and closing out
orders.

¢ Reduced supplier list. The number of active vendors in the purchasing database
can be greatly reduced, which allows the buying staff to focus on better rela-
tions with the remaining ones on the list.

¢ Reduced mailroom volume. Even the mailroom will experience a drop in vol-
ume, since there will be far fewer incoming supplier invoices and outgoing
company checks.

A procurement card is easy to implement (just hand it out to employees), though
one should keep a significant difficulty in mind: The banks that issue credit cards
must expend extra labor to set up a procurement card for a company, since each
one must be custom-designed. Consequently, they prefer to issue procurement
cards only to those companies that can show a significant volume of credit card
business—usually at least $1 million per year. This volume limitation makes it
difficult for a smaller company to use procurement cards. This problem can be
partially avoided by using a group of supplier-specific credit cards. For example,
a company can sign up for a credit card with its office supply store, another with its
building materials store, and another with its electrical supplies store. This results
in a somewhat larger number of credit card statements per month, but they are
already sorted by supplier, so they are essentially a “poor man’s procurement card.”

3-5 AUTOMATE THREE-WAY MATCHING

The three-way matching process is a manual one at most companies; that is, a
clerk matches a supplier invoice to a company purchase order and a receiving


30 Accounts Payable Best Practices

document in order to ensure that the correct quantities (and costs) ordered are the
same ones received and billed. This is a painfully slow and inefficient process,
given the large number of documents involved, as well as the startling number of
exceptions that nearly always arise.

There are two ways to solve the problem. One is to dispense with three-way
matching entirely, which requires considerable reengineering of the accounts
payable process, as well as retraining of the receiving staff and even of suppliers.
This process was described in detail in the “Pay Based on Receiving Approval
Only” section earlier in this chapter. Though the most elegant solution, it also
requires the most work to implement.

The second solution requires some software changes that may already be avail-
able in the existing software package, with minimal changes to employee proce-
dures, while still resulting in efficiency improvements (though not on the scale of
the first solution). This best practice involves keeping the matching process in its
current form, but using the computer system to perform the matching work. In
order to automate three-way matching, all three documents must be entered into the
computer system. This is easy for purchase orders, since most companies already
enter purchase orders directly into the computer in order to track purchase orders
through the manufacturing system. The next-easiest document to enter is the
receiving document, which can be either a bill of lading or a packing slip. To do so,
there should be a computer terminal at the receiving dock that is linked to the main
accounting database so that all information entered at the dock is centrally stored.
Finally, the supplier invoice must be entered into the computer system—line by
line. It is common enough to enter the supplier’s invoice number and dollar amount
into the computer system, but automated matching requires the complete entry of
all line items, quantities, and costs into the system, which can be a considerable
chore. Once this information is in the accounting database, the computer system
automatically matches the three documents (usually using the purchase order num-
ber as the index), compares all line items, and presents a summary of the matched
documents to the accounting staff, showing any variances between the matched
documents. The accounting staff can then scan the information and decide if the
variances require further analysis or if they can be paid as is. This best practice
automates an existing manual process without a large number of changes.

When deciding to use this best practice, it is useful to compare the savings
from eliminating manual matching to the added cost of keying all the documents
into the central database. There may also be an expense associated with installing
the matching software in the system, though it is usually an integral part of the
more advanced accounting packages. Low-end accounting packages do not nor-
mally contain the automated matching feature.

3-6 Digitize Accounts Payable Documents 31

3-6 DIGITIZE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DOCUMENTS

When accounting files are sent to the archives at the end of the year, the portion
taken up by the accounts payable documents usually exceeds that of all other
documents combined. For some companies with voluminous accounts payable
files, it is a major expense to remove all the paperwork, box it up and identify it,
and ship it off to a warehouse, from which it must be recalled occasionally for
various tasks. Digitizing the documents is a means of avoiding the expense of
archiving.

Digitizing a document means that it is laid on a scanner that converts the
document image into an electronic image stored in the computer database, which
can be recalled by anyone with access to the database. To digitize a document,
there should be a high-speed scanner available that is linked to a computer net-
work. Documents are fed into the scanner and assigned one or more index num-
bers or codes, so that it will be easy to recall the correct documents from storage.
For example, a document can be indexed by its purchase order number, date, or
supplier number. A combination of several indexes is the best approach, since one
can still recall a document, even if one does not remember the first index number.
The document images are usually stored on an optical disk since it can hold enor-
mous amounts of storage space (and digitized documents take up a lot of com-
puter storage space). There will probably be many optical disks to provide a suf-
ficient amount of storage, so the disks are usually stored in a ‘“‘jukebox,” which
gives the user access to all the data on all the storage disks. Users can then call up
the images from any terminal that is linked to the network where the information
is stored.

There are additional advantages to using digitization of documents. Besides
the reduced archiving costs, it is also possible to nearly eliminate the time needed
to access documents. With a traditional archiving system, older documents must
be requested from a warehousing facility that may require several days to deliver.
Even in-house documents may require several minutes to an hour to locate. If
customer service is important, and that service is linked to providing rapid access
to data, then digitizing documents allows a company to instantly satisfy customer
requests for documents by searching the computer files for them, no matter how
old the documents may be. Another advantage to using digitization is that it
avoids having to take out and replace files. Whenever someone removes a file and
later returns it, there is a risk that the file will be misplaced. Every time a file is
misplaced, it will be time-consuming to find it again. By accessing documents
through a computer network, there is no need to take out or replace the docu-
ment—it is always sitting in the same storage location in the computer, and can-
not be lost. Yet another advantage is that multiple users can access the same file at
the same time. Since it is a digital image, there is no reason why the computer
cannot potentially distribute a copy of the digital document to everyone who asks
for it, even if they all do so at the same time. A final advantage to digitization is
that it can be used to send an electronic file to a manager requesting an electronic


32 Accounts Payable Best Practices

approval before a payment will be made. This approach keeps the digital docu-
ment from being lost during the approval process (a common problem when
paper documents are used for approvals), while instantly moving a digital approval
through the computer network, which also speeds up the transfer of approval
information. In short, there are a variety of good reasons for digitizing accounts
payable documents, besides the most common one of eliminating archiving costs.
Though this best practice may seem like an ideal way to avoid lost files, reduce
archiving costs, shrink document search times, and allow for remote payment
approvals, there is one problem with it that bars most small companies from
installing it. The main issue is cost. The price of a high-speed scanner, computer, and
optical storage jukebox can easily exceed the cost savings from all the advantages of
this approach. The most cost-effective situations for digital storage are when there is
either a very high storage cost that can be eliminated (especially common in high-
rent accounting facilities where storage space is at a premium) or the volume of
transactions is so high that there is no practical alternative to storing, filing, and
moving all the paperwork. Consequently, digitizing accounts payable documents is
normally limited to larger companies or those with expensive storage facilities.

3-7 DIRECTLY ENTER RECEIPTS
INTO COMPUTER WV Author’s Choice

One portion of the accounts payable matching process is to physically match
some evidence of receipt, usually a packing slip or bill of lading, to a supplier
invoice, thereby proving that the goods being paid for were actually received. The
receiving documentation usually wends its way to the accounts payable staff over
a period of several days, and may be lost on the way. Once it arrives, the informa-
tion may not agree with the quantities being billed by the supplier. Consequently,
the matching of receiving documentation tends to be either delayed, missing, or
cause for extra reconciliation work by the accounting staff.

There are several solutions to the receiving paperwork problem. Two are out-
lined in other sections of this chapter. One is using fully automated matching of
all accounts payable documents, which requires the input of all paperwork into
the computer—receiving information, the supplier invoice, and the purchase
order—so that the computer can automatically match the documents. This
requires complicated software that not all computer systems may have available.
It is described further in the ““Automate Three-Way Matching” section. Another
solution is to have the receiving staff approve purchase orders for payment based
on what has just been received. This is a more radical approach that is extremely
efficient but that requires a complete redesign of the accounts payable process.
This section describes a less monumental change that can usually be imple-
mented by most accounting systems.


3-8 Fax Transmission of Accounts Payable Documents 33

The alternative approach is to enter receipts directly into the computer sys-
tem, rather than forwarding receiving documents to the accounting department
for manual matching to the supplier invoice. This approach has the advantage of
instant communication of receipts to the accounting staff, since an entry into the
accounting database at the receiving dock will be instantly transmitted to the
accounting staff. The accounting software can then compare received amounts to
the purchase order (which is usually entered into the computer already). All that
is left for the accounting staff to do at this point is to enter the purchase order
number listed on the supplier’s invoice into the computer to see what quantity has
been received and how much has not yet been paid. By taking this approach, the
bulk of the accounts payable matching process is eliminated.

Before implementing this best practice, there are a few issues to review. One
is that the receiving staff must be properly trained in how to enter receipts into the
computer. If they are not, receipts information will be inaccurate, probably result-
ing in the accounts payable staff going back to manual matching, since it is the
only way to ensure that invoices are accurately paid. Another issue is ensuring
that the existing accounting software allows the receiving personnel to enter
receipts information. This is a standard feature on most accounting software
packages. However, some software packages do not use the information once it is
entered, so it is important to see if the software will match receipts to purchase
orders, showing any variances that may arise. If these issues can be overcome,
then it is reasonable for companies of any size or complexity to implement the
direct entry of receiving information into the computer at the receiving dock.

Cost: Sr Installation time:

3-8 FAX TRANSMISSION OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DOCUMENTS

A centralized accounts payable department may have some difficulty receiving
documents from outlying locations or suppliers in time to take early payment dis-
counts. For example, a supplier invoice may be sent to the wrong location, from
which it must be mailed to the accounts payable location, or a bill of lading must
be forwarded. In either case, the time delay involved may be so long that there is
no way to take an early payment discount.

The best way to avoid this problem is to find an alternative method for trans-
mitting documents (with all due respect to the Postal Service). Though one
approach is to enter all information directly into the accounting database from
any location (see the “‘Directly Enter Receipts into Computer” section earlier in
this chapter), many companies cannot afford an enterprisewide computer system
that makes such an approach feasible. A simpler approach is to fax all documents
to the accounts payable facility. To do so, there should be a separate fax machine
that only handles incoming accounts payable documents; by setting aside a
machine for this purpose, it guarantees that the fax machine will not be tied up by


34 Accounts Payable Best Practices

outgoing fax transmissions. Also, since it is only used for one purpose, it is
unlikely that incoming faxes will be mistakenly taken to other departments. To
make this system work even better, the accounting manager should look into get-
ting a fax rerouting capability that sends incoming faxes to an electronic mailbox
if the fax machine is busy, with transmission occurring as soon as the fax
machine is available to receive new incoming transmissions. This service is inex-
pensive and ensures that all documents sent are received.

There are few disadvantages to this best practice. It requires a separate phone
line for the fax machine, a fax rerouting capability that is nothing more than a
voice mailbox for faxes, and a fax machine. However, none of these requirements
are expensive. Also, there is a slight risk that some faxes will not be sent correctly
or will be lost in transmission. In these cases, it may be possible to generate a
custom report from the accounting software that lists all missing documents
needed to process various accounts payable transactions. The accounting staff
can use this report to fax out requests to subsidiaries for missing documents, so
that anything that was lost on the first transmission attempt can be sent again. On
the whole, this is an easy best practice to implement for those organizations that
use centralized processing of accounts payable for multiple company locations.

3-9 HAVE SUPPLIERS INCLUDE THEIR SUPPLIER
NUMBERS ON INVOICES

The typical vendor database includes listings for thousands of suppliers. Every
time an invoice arrives from a supplier, the accounts payable staff must scroll
through the list to determine the vendor code for each one. If there are similar
names for different suppliers, or multiple locations for the same one, it is quite
likely that the resulting check payments will go astray, leading to lots of extra
time to sort through who should have been paid. This basic problem can be par-
tially resolved by having suppliers include the supplier number, as created by the
company’s accounting system, on their invoices. The easiest way to do so is to
mail out a change-of-address form to all suppliers, listing the same company
address, but also noting as part of the address an “accounts payable code” that
includes the supplier number. Suppliers will gladly add this line to the mailing
address to which they send their invoices, since they think it is a routing code that
will expedite payment to them (which, in a way, it will). Some follow-up may be
necessary to ensure that all suppliers adopt this extra address line. Even if not all
of the suppliers elect to make the change, there will still be an increase in effi-
ciency caused by those that have done so.

There are two problems with this approach. One is that the change of address
mailing cannot be a bulk mailing of the same letter, since each letter must include
the supplier code that is unique to each recipient. This will call for a mail merge


3-10 Receive Billings through Electronic Data Interchange 35

software application that can create a separate and unique letter for each recipi-
ent. The other problem is that new suppliers (i.e., those arriving after the bulk
mailing) must be given a supplier code at the time they are first set up on the sys-
tem. This may require a special phone call to the supplier’s accounts payable
department to ensure that the code is added to their address file, or else a periodic
mailing to all new suppliers that specifies their supplier codes.

3-10 RECEIVE BILLINGS THROUGH ELECTRONIC
DATA INTERCHANGE

Many of the larger companies, especially those in the retailing industry, have been
using electronic data interchange (EDI) for some time. This section describes what
EDI is, how it works, why more companies should use it, and why so many do not.

EDI involves the transfer of electronic documents between companies.
These documents are sent in strictly defined formats, of which there are over a
hundred, one for each type of standard company transaction, including a supplier
billing. These formats tend to be very large and complex because they are
designed for use by multiple industries; most companies only need to fill out a
small portion of each EDI message. Once completed, an EDI message is trans-
mitted to the recipient. This can be done directly, but it usually goes to a third-
party provider that maintains a mainframe computer that receives messages from
a number of subscribing companies. The message recipient dials into its elec-
tronic mailbox at the third-party’s mainframe (usually several times a day) to
pick up any EDI messages. The recipient then enters each EDI message into its
own system for further processing. The reader may notice that a company could
achieve the same rapid transfer of information by sending a fax with the same
information. This is true, but if properly installed, EDI allows for a greater degree
of automation by linking directly into a company’s computer system. For exam-
ple, a paper-based fax must be rekeyed into the recipient’s computer system,
whereas an EDI message is in a standardized electronic format and so can be run
through an automatic conversion program that enters the data into the recipient’s
computer system with no manual data-entry work at all. This feature gives EDI a
distinct advantage over a fax transmission.

Larger companies use EDI most frequently because it allows them to automat-
ically process large quantities of transactions with no manual data-entry work,
which can be important when there are hundreds of thousands of transactions flow-
ing through the system. When data is entered by hand, there is a potential for errors
in the keypunching, which probably means that there will be hundreds or thousands
of man-made errors to correct in these larger companies, just given the volumes of
data that must be entered. Thus, EDI allows them not only to avoid the expense of
data entry, but also the expense of tracking down and fixing data-entry errors.


36 Accounts Payable Best Practices

If EDI makes a company so efficient, why are only the largest companies
using it? The answer is simple: It is expensive to implement and only the
largest transaction volumes will offset the cost of the initial setup. For example,
if a company wants to receive all of its accounts payable billings by EDI, it
must first contact each supplier and persuade it to send EDI transmissions, set up
procedures between the two companies for doing so, and then test the system
before “going live.” In addition, the true labor savings will only be realized if
the incoming EDI messages are automatically entered into the recipient’s computer
system, which calls for the customized programming of an automated interface
between the EDI system and the recipient’s computer system—this can be an
expensive undertaking. Most suppliers will not want to participate in this system
unless there are significant transaction volumes between them and the company —
why go to the trouble for a small customer? In short, EDI is not catching on in
smaller companies because of the expense and effort of installing the system, plus
the difficulty of forcing suppliers to participate. Though larger companies may
convince their direct trading partners to use EDI, this best practice will only
spread through the ranks of smaller companies with the greatest difficulty.

A company may be experiencing some difficulty in persuading its suppliers to
switch over to the transmission of invoices by EDI, which would allow it to
automatically process all incoming invoices without any data rekeying. A
typical complaint when this request is made is that special EDI software must
be purchased and stored in a separate computer, while someone must be
trained, not only in how to use the software, but also in how to reformat the
invoicing data into the format used by the EDI transaction. This problem can
be partially avoided by having suppliers access a Web site where they can con-
duct the data entry.

By having suppliers enter data into a Web site instead of through an EDI
transaction, they can avoid the need for any special software that is stored on an
in-house computer. A Web site merely requires Internet access, which is com-
monly available through most computers. Once the data has been entered at the
Web site, a company can shift the data to an automated EDI transaction processing
program that will convert the data into an EDI format and transmit it to the com-
pany’s accounting system. Thus, suppliers can use either EDI or Web-based data
entry to send invoices to a company, which will process them both in EDI format.

There are some costs associated with this best practice. One is that the com-
pany may have to use special discounts or early payments to convince suppliers
to use the Web site, rather than simply mailing in their invoices. Also, the Web

site must be constructed and maintained, while other software must be created
that converts the incoming transactions into EDI format and then ports the result-
ing data to the accounting system for further processing. Consequently, this can
be a relatively expensive option to implement, and so may only be useful for
those organizations experiencing a large volume of transactions.

3-12 SHIFT INCOMING BILLINGS TO AN EDI
DATA-ENTRY SUPPLIER

A company may have the best intentions for improving its accounts payable
process, but cannot shift to a fully automated system because its suppliers
refuse to send invoices in EDI format. Consequently, the company has no
opportunity to automatically shift incoming EDI messages into the accounts
payable system, automatically process them, and automatically send out an
automated clearinghouse payment. In short, the company is stuck with a man-
ual data entry front end to the accounts payable process. This is a particular
problem when a company is so small that its suppliers see no reason to shift
over to EDI transactions just for its benefit. This issue can be surmounted by
sending the incoming invoices to an EDI supplier that is willing to keypunch
the invoices into an EDI format.

To do so, a company can either have suppliers mail all invoices to a lockbox
that is accessed by the EDI supplier, or it can remail the invoices to the EDI sup-
plier. This supplier (really just a “body shop” that keypunches data) will reenter
the invoice information into an EDI format and transmit it to the company, which
can then process the invoices in a highly automated manner. Though this may
seem like an expensive way to handle invoice processing, it will allow an
accounts payable department to eliminate virtually all of its data-entry positions.
The disadvantages to this approach are a slight increase in costs over what it
would take to process the invoices in-house, as well as a time delay while the
invoices are remailed to the supplier (which may have an impact on the timing of
payments back to suppliers).

A variation on this approach is to arrange with an Internet-based bill present-
ment service to handle this function. For example, one can tell suppliers to send
their invoices to companies such as CyberBills or Paytrust, which scan the bills
into their computer systems and then send an e-mail to the company, notifying
the accounting department when a payment is due. The accounting staff can then
access the on-line databases of these bill presentment services and pay for all
bills electronically from one central location.

38 Accounts Payable Best Practices

3-13 AUDIT EXPENSE REPORTS W Author's Choice

A labor-intensive task for the accounts payable employees involves carefully
reviewing every line item on employee expense reports, comparing everything to
the company policy for allowable travel or entertainment expenses, and then con-
tacting employees regarding inconsistencies prior to issuing a check. For a large
company with many traveling employees, this can be an extraordinarily labor-
intensive task. Furthermore, most employees create accurate expense reports, so
the labor expended by the accounts payable staff is rarely equal to the cost savings
all the review work generates. To make the situation more unbearable for employees,
the expense reviews take so long to complete that there can be a serious delay
before an employee receives payment for a check—especially if the expense report
is rejected due to reporting failures by the employee, resulting in the expense
report moving back and forth several times between the employee and the account-
ing department before it is paid. When there is so much document travel time, it
is also common for the expense report to be “‘lost in the shuffle,’ meaning that the
employee may have to create the expense report all over again and resubmit it.
All of these factors result in an inefficient process in the accounting department
and lots of angry employees who are waiting for reimbursement.

The solution to this problem is to replace a total review of all expense reports
with an occasional audit. This approach involves taking a sample of many employ-
ees’ expense reports every few months and comparing the reported amounts to the
company travel and entertainment policy to see if there are any exceptions. If the
exceptions are significant, it may be necessary to follow up with additional
reviews of the expense reports of the same employees to investigate possible
abuse. The audit usually results in a list of common expense reporting problems,
as well as the names of employees who are abusing the expense reporting system.
There are several solutions to ongoing expense reporting problems:

¢ Employee education. It may be necessary to periodically reissue the company
policy on travel and entertainment, with follow-up calls to specific abusers to
reinforce the policy. This advance work keeps problems from showing up on
expense reports.

¢ Flag employees for continual audits. If some employees simply cannot cre-
ate a correct expense report, they can be listed for ongoing audits to ensure
that every report they create is reviewed for accuracy.

¢ Flag employees for complete reviews by the accounts payable staff. Some
employees may be so inept at issuing proper expense reports that their
reports must be totally reviewed prior to reimbursement. These problem
employees can be flagged during the audits.


3-14 Automate Expense Reporting 39

The audit work is usually carried out by the internal audit department, rather than
the accounts payable personnel, since the internal auditors are appropriately
experienced in this sort of review work.

When using this best practice, there can be a concern that employee reporting
abuses will go unnoticed until an auditor finds a problem after the fact. This is a
legitimate concern. However, when the audit staff selects expense reports for
review, they should stratify the sample of reports so that there is a preponderance
of very expensive expense reports in the sample, which means that any poten-
tially exorbitant abuses will have a greater chance of being discovered. Though
these discoveries will be after the fact, when employees have already been paid,
the company can still seek reimbursement, especially if the employees are still on
the payroll, so that adjustments can be taken from their paychecks. On the other
hand, if employees have already left the company, any overpayments probably
cannot be reimbursed.

In short, replacing a total review of all expense reports with an occasional
audit can significantly reduce the workload of the accounts payable staff, though
there is some risk that employee reporting abuses will result in large overpay-
ments prior to discovery.

3-14 AUTOMATE EXPENSE REPORTING

One of the tasks of the accounts payable staff is to check carefully all of the
expenses reported in an employee’s expense report to ensure that all expenses are
valid and have the correct supporting documentation. This can be a major task if
there are many expense reports. This will be the case if a company is a large one
or has a large proportion of personnel who travel, which is common if a company
is in the consulting or sales fields. Luckily, some companies have found a way to
get around all of this review work.

A best practice that nearly eliminates the expense report review work of
the accounts payable staff is to create a “smart” computer program that walks an
employee through the expense reporting process, flagging problem expenses as
soon as they are entered and requiring back-up receipts for only selected items.
The system is highly customized, since the review rules will vary by company.
For example, one company may have a policy of requiring back-up for all
meals, whereas another company may automatically hand out a per diem meals
payment and will not care about meals receipts. Such variations in expense
reporting policies will inevitably result in an automated expense reporting system
that is closely tailored to each company’s needs; such a system should probably
be programmed in-house, which is a very expensive undertaking. Due to the
high level of expense, this best practice will only pay for itself if it offsets a
great deal of accounts payable work, so there should be a very large number of


40 Accounts Payable Best Practices

expense reports being submitted before anyone tries to implement the concept.
These software packages are quite expensive. A package that is hosted on the
Internet, with a dedicated line to the customer, could cost as little as $35,000,
while a full-blown installation at a large company could cost as much as
$500,000.

The logical flow of automated expense reporting is noted in the following
process. The key issue here is that all employees must have direct access to the
program, so it can respond to their expense entries as soon as they make them.
This requires on-line access by anyone who will use the program, which means
that every user not only must have access to a computer or terminal, but probably
also have a modem for dial-in access. One must consider these hardware costs as
well as the previously noted software costs before implementing this best prac-
tice. The processing steps are as follows:

1. The user accesses an on-line expense reporting form that is linked to the cen-
tral expense reporting software and database.

2. The user enters expenses by date and category.

3. The software reviews all expenses as entered and flags those that are not
allowable. It rejects these and notifies the user, along with an explanation.

4. The software reviews all remaining expenses and decides which items
require a back-up receipt.

5. The user prints out a transmittal form that details all required receipts and
that also contains a unique transmittal number that is linked to the expense
report that was just entered into the computer.

6. Upon completion by the user, the electronic expense report is routed by e-mail
to the user’s supervisor, who electronically approves or rejects the report. If
rejected, the supervisor can note the problem on the expense report, which is
then routed back to the user for resubmission.

7. The user attaches all receipts to the transmittal form and mails it to the
accounts payable department.

 

8. When the accounts payable department receives the transmittal form and
receipts, it verifies that all receipts are included and that the expense report
has been approved by the supervisor, and then approves the entire package.

9. Upon approval by the accounts payable staff, the expense report is immedi-
ately paid by wire transfer to the bank account of the user.

10. The transmittal form and receipts are filed.

These detailed steps are shown in graphical form in Exhibit 3.3. Though there
appear to be more steps in the automated process than there are in a traditional
process, the extra steps are automatic or much simpler. The overall result is far
less processing time, as well as a significant reduction in the time needed before
an employee is paid.

The solution just noted is for an automated employee expense reporting sys-
tem that is entirely custom programmed. However, many organizations do not
process a sufficient number of employee expense reports to justify the cost of all
the programming time that is required to create the system. For these organizations,
a good alternative is to purchase one of the automated expense reporting software
packages that are now available. These packages are entirely self-contained and do
an effective job of processing employee expense reports, but they do not provide
direct linkages to the rest of a company’s accounting system. For this, a custom-
designed interface module is still required. A Web-based expense reporting pack-

age is especially useful, since employees in outlying locations or who are traveling
can use the system at any location where they can access the Internet; moreover,
it requires no software installation on anyone’s computers. Also, Web-based soft-
ware can be updated easily, whereas client-server systems require updates on
individual user computers. Further, if someone steals an employee’s computer,
there is no time or expense information stored on it, since this information is sub-
mitted directly through the Internet to a different storage location. Examples of
such packages are made by Captura Software, Concur Technologies, Extensity,
Inc., Acceleron, IBM, Oracle, Peoplesoft, and SAP.

3-15 ELIMINATE CASH ADVANCES FOR EMPLOYEE TRAVEL

Many employees with few funds on hand will come to the accounts payable
department asking for cash advances so they can go on company-mandated trips.
By doing so, the department may be handing over more cash than the employee
really needs, which can make it difficult to collect any unspent cash. In addition,
employees who have already been paid for their expenditures have no incentive
to submit an expense report, especially when the report may reveal that they must
pay some of the original advance back to the company. The usual result is a pro-
longed process of asking employees for expense reports, while the amount of the
original advance remains, incorrectly, on the accounting books as a prepaid asset.
This problem is eliminated by denying cash travel advances. However, this is
much easier said than done. In reality, many employees simply cannot afford to
be out-of-pocket on any company-related expenses. If so, the company can pur-
chase many of their expenses for them, such as airline tickets. Also, such an
employee can travel with another employee who has the financial wherewithal to
absorb cash expenditures for both employees. As a last resort, the company can
also issue company credit cards to employees, though this raises the risk of having
the cards used for noncompany purchases. Through some combination of these
actions, a company can reduce its reliance on cash advances to employees.

3-16 LINK CORPORATE TRAVEL POLICIES TO AN AUTOMATED
EXPENSE REPORTING SYSTEM

The typical set of travel policies used by a company is quite detailed—thou shalt
not charge to the company the cost of movies, clothing, first-class upgrades, and
so on. However, the overburdened accounts payable staff has little time to review
expense reports for these items, much less to then create variance reports and


3-17 Transmit Expense Reports by E-Mail 43

send them out to the violating employees and their supervisors. An additional
problem is that corporate travel policies change with some regularity, which
makes it difficult for the accounts payable staff to even know which policies are
still valid. A further problem arises when a company reimburses its employees
based on the per diem rates listed in the Federal Travel Regulation. This docu-
ment is used by the federal government to determine a reasonable cost of living at
each of over 100 cities throughout the country; given the frequency of change in
these numbers (at least quarterly), it becomes very labor-intensive to determine
which payments to make to employees. However, these problems can be elimi-
nated by converting the travel policies into rules that can be used by a computer
to automatically spot problems with expense reports that have been submitted
through an automated expense reporting system.

For example, input from a corporate travel card into an automated expense
reporting system can tell if an airfare is for a first-class seat, which may be pro-
hibited by company travel policy. If the first-class purchase can be set up as a
flagged field, then the computer system can automatically spot this issue and
either note it on a report or (more proactively) send an e-mail to the appropriate
person, who makes note of the issue. Examples of other rule violations are to ver-
ify that the correct airline was used (since there may be a bulk-purchase agree-
ment in place) and that restaurant bills were actually incurred during the period
spanned by a business trip (rather than before or after, which would be suspi-
cious). However, this sort of early-warning system can be quite expensive to cre-
ate. There are no standard software packages that perform this task, so the pro-
gramming staff must be called on to convert policies into rules that can be
understood by the computer system, and then set up an interface between the
tules database and the expense report database that will spot rule violations. In
short, this can be an expensive option to install, and so should only be considered
if there is a clear likelihood that there will be significant resulting cost savings.

3-17 TRANSMIT EXPENSE REPORTS BY E-MAIL

In an earlier section in this chapter, “Automate Expense Reporting,” there was a
discussion of how a company can install an automated system to walk users
through the process of submitting an expense report. Though it is so automated
that there is only a minimal need for any human intervention, it is also a system
that is usually created with custom programming. This is very expensive and
probably not worth the effort for companies without a sufficient volume of
expense reporting. This section describes a “poor man’s automated expense
report” for those companies that cannot afford a more sophisticated system.

The “poor man’s approach” involves using the existing e-mail system to
transmit expense reports to the accounts payable department. This approach does


44 Accounts Payable Best Practices

not automatically route the expense report to a supervisor for electronic
approval—either the person submitting the report or the accounts payable staff
must do this. Also, most e-mail systems do not allow for electronic approvals, so
this step may not be possible, in which case the only options are to route a paper
copy to a supervisor (which defeats the purpose of using e-mail) or to avoid the
approval step and just audit reports after the fact to ensure that they would have
been approved. Also, an e-mail transmission does not allow for an interactive
review of all expenses as they are entered, so the electronic form being used to
create the expense report should contain a text section that describes all travel
and entertainment expense reporting rules. Each person submitting an expense
report must read these rules to determine which expenses to report and which
back-up materials to submit. In addition, each person transmitting an expense
report must mail in all receipts that go with the expense report, without the trans-
mittal document that would be used with a more advanced expense reporting sys-
tem. Finally, payments are made by check, with entries being made manually into
the accounts payable system, rather than automatically with wire transfers. Thus,
this simplified system may not allow for supervisory approval, does not interac-
tively review all expenses, does not issue a transmittal document, and does not
automatically issue a payment. On the other hand, it is much easier and cheaper
to implement than a full-blown automated expense-reporting system.

As an example of how this simplified reporting system works, the accounts
payable department periodically issues a spreadsheet to all employees (by e-mail),
set up in an expense-reporting format. It shows where expenses are to be listed
and contains the key reporting rules within the body of the spreadsheet. When a
user completes the spreadsheet with actual data, the file is attached to an e-mail
addressed to the accounts payable department. All receipts are sent to the depart-
ment by mail, along with a paper copy of the expense report. The accounting staff
receives the e-mail, prints out the expense report, and then enters the data imme-
diately into the accounts payable database for payment. The staff has the option
of either issuing payment right away or waiting until the receipts are received.
Later, the internal auditing staff can review a selection of expense reports to see if
all reporting rules were followed.

This approach does not allow for as much control over expense reporting as
a fully interactive system, but it does allow most companies to quickly install a
partially automated system that improves the efficiency of the accounts payable
staff—usually in just a few days or weeks.

3-18 CENTRALIZE THE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE FUNCTION

A company with many subsidiaries or locations usually has a separate accounts
payable function located in each facility. This can be inefficient for several reasons.


3-18 Centralize the Accounts Payable Function 45

First, the accounting staff at each location requires a supervisor, so the sum total
of supervisors at all the locations can be substantial. Second, there can be prob-
lems with suppliers sending invoices to the wrong locations. This is a particular
problem when the subsidiaries all have the same or similar names, since it is dif-
ficult for a supplier to figure out which location is the correct one to which a bill
should be sent. The problem is exacerbated if a supplier ships to several company
locations and then must issue a separate invoice to each location, since it is con-
fusing to issue billings when not only the company names are identical, but also
the goods shipped to all of them. Third, the many accounts payable departments
all require training and auditing to ensure that they all process payments in the
same manner. If a company does not do this, it is likely that discounts will not be
taken or that payments will be made without proper authorization. Finally, there
is a lack of control when the accounts payable function is widely distributed.
Local management can interfere with the payable process to make payments to
themselves or to entities they control, while still giving the appearance of good
local controls. All of these problems can be either eliminated or mitigated by
using a central accounts payable facility.

This facility does not have to be near any other company locations. It pays all
supplier invoices, using a single computer system and a single accounting data-
base, and operates under the control of a small, unified group of managers. It has
multiple advantages. First, there are far fewer managers, since there is only one
group of people to control. Second, there are no problems with supplier invoices
and related information disappearing, because all invoices are sent to the one pro-
cessing location. If a supplier incorrectly sends paperwork to the wrong location,
all facilities know where it must be forwarded, so the documents always arrive at
the correct point (though they may take a roundabout route to get there). Third, all
accounts payable activities can be easily monitored and corrected, since the audit-
ing personnel only have to review one facility. Finally, there is better control over
the process, since the accounts payable function is divorced from local control;
there is no way for a local manager to influence payments. All of these advantages
have a single result—lower cost, primarily through an overall reduction in the
number of personnel. It has been proven many times that a single, centralized
accounts payable function is considerably cheaper than a dispersed function.

Despite all these advantages, some companies balk at centralizing because of
protests by local managers. They claim that some payments must be made
locally, because some payments are cash-on-delivery, in cash, or require such
short payment intervals that the central facility cannot respond in time. They are
correct. However, this is such a small proportion of the bills at most facilities that
a local plant can get by with a few checks per month, which are drawn on a sepa-
rate bank account in which the company keeps a very small cash reserve. By lim-
iting the size of local payments, a company can limit its exposure to any unwar-
ranted local payments. By meeting local management demands partway, a
company can still centralize the bulk of its payments while continuing to allow

some local flexibility. This is a very good best practice to implement if a com-
pany has multiple locations.

3-19 ISSUE STANDARD ACCOUNT CODE LIST

Accounts payable can be a difficult area in which to replace employees while still
experiencing high levels of productivity. The problem is caused by the time it
takes a new person to learn the accounts to which invoices should be coded. Even
when experienced accounts payable clerks are hired, they still must memorize the
account codes, which will slow them down considerably. Even an experienced,
long-term employee may occasionally misdirect a supplier invoice to the wrong
account, so some solution is necessary to resolve the issue.

The easiest way to resolve the problem is to reduce the chart of accounts (which
can be a very lengthy document) down to a single page of key accounts to which
invoices are to be coded. Most invoices can be applied to a very small number of
accounts, so this is usually a very viable option. When the shortened list is posted
at each accounts payable clerk’s desk, it becomes a simple reference tool for finding
the correct account, which improves productivity while reducing the error rate.

A more sophisticated way to resolve the problem is to encode the accounting
software with an account number for each supplier. Under this method, the clerk
does not have to worry about the account to which anything should be coded
because the computer already contains the information. However, there are two
problems with this approach. One is that some software packages do not contain
this information, and expensive programming is necessary to install it. The second
problem is that the account code may change, depending on what the supplier is
billing. Given the trend toward supplier consolidation, it is increasingly likely
that a company will go to one supplier for a wide range of products and services,
so that several account codes may apply to a single supplier.

A simple list of approved account codes is an easy way to improve the pro-
ductivity and reduce the error rate of the accounts payable staff, especially that of
new employees.

3-20 LINK SUPPLIER REQUESTS TO THE ACCOUNTS
PAYABLE DATABASE

A significant task for an accounts payable person, especially one working for a
company that pays its bills late, is to answer payment queries from suppliers.
They want to know when their invoices were paid, the amount of the payments,


3-20 Link Supplier Requests to the Accounts Payable Database 47

and the check numbers that were issued. For a company that is seriously delin-
quent in its payments, this can be a full-time job for the accounting staff, which is
also a clear loss of productive time.

A recent innovation that largely eliminates verbal responses to suppliers is to
have suppliers call a phone number that links them to a keypad-activated inquiry
system that will answer their most common questions. For example, they can
enter the company’s purchase order number, their invoice number, or the sup-
plier’s name; the system will then respond with the specific payments made, the
date on which the check was cut, and the check number. The system can even be
extended to list the date on which payments are scheduled to be made.

However, there are some issues to consider before installing an automated
supplier response system. One issue is that this is a very recent innovation and
most suppliers will not be used to it—they want to talk to a person and will del-
uge the company’s operator to voice this opinion. To quell this type of response,
the system should include an option to exit the automated system and contact a
person. This allows the more technologically versed suppliers to use the auto-
mated system, while other users can still talk to a person. This option is also nec-
essary for those cases where there are unusual circumstances. For example, a
company may not be paying due to a lack of receiving documentation, or because
the quantity billed was incorrect; it is better to discuss these problems with a per-
son instead of a computer, since special actions may need to be taken to resolve
the situation. The other problem is the cost of the installation. It requires an inter-
face computer that links to the main accounting computer system, as well as
modem access and software, to translate supplier requests into inquiries that the
accounting database can answer. These costs can be considerable, especially
when there are expected to be many callers and many requests for information.
The price range typically starts at $20,000 for the smallest installations and can
be many times higher for large systems. Nonetheless, this is a good approach for
companies that feel they can bring about a major efficiency improvement by rout-
ing suppliers straight to the accounts payable database for information.

An alternative to having suppliers access accounts payable information
through a phone connection is to do so through an Internet site. This approach is
somewhat more flexible than a voice-activated system that is generally limited to
a few simple status messages. Instead, a Web page can itemize the exact status of
each payable item, assign a code to it that explains the reasons for any delays, and
note the name of the contact person in the accounts payable department who is
responsible for processing the supplier invoice. It can also list any missing infor-
mation that is delaying payment, such as a purchase order number or bank
account number for the supplier, which can be entered by the supplier directly into
the Web site, and which will be automatically loaded into the accounting database
to assist in the completion of processing. The Web page may even list the name of
the person who is responsible for approving the invoice, as well as this person’s
contact information. A company may not want to add this last piece of informa-
tion, since it can greatly increase the volume of phone calls to these people, who

will in turn bother the accounts payable staff about payment— something that it is
trying to avoid through the use of this Web site.

3-21 OUTSOURCE THE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE FUNCTION

Many controllers do not want to waste time managing such a mundane function
as accounts payable. It does not directly contribute to the mission of any company,
nor does it impact customer service. In short, it is a baseline clerical function that
merely takes up management time with no particular payback. By off-loading
this function to a supplier who specializes in accounts payable processing, a con-
troller can reduce the management time devoted to this functional area and allocate
more time to other more profitable company functions.

Besides reduced management time, it can also be less expensive to outsource
to a qualified supplier. A well-run supplier has an excellent knowledge of accounts
payable best practices and uses that knowledge to drastically cut the processing
effort needed. This is an especially attractive option for those companies that are in
difficult financial circumstances and that would prefer to pay just a per-transaction
fee, rather than an entire staff. This essentially converts a large fixed cost to a
variable cost that will not be incurred if there are no transactions to process.

Outsourcing accounts payable usually means that the entire company staff
devoted to this work will be shifted to the supplier who is taking over the work,
though it is also possible that the supplier will not need these people, or will
“cherry-pick” only the most qualified. If the latter is the case, then the controller
should meet with the staff to honestly appraise their future prospects with the
supplier or to provide outplacement counseling. The supplier should also be
available at these meetings to answer any employee questions, as well as to enroll
employees in supplier benefit plans and to convert them to the supplier’s payroll
system.

Besides the staff conversion, the controller must also determine how to man-
age the supplier. This is not a case of handing the work to the supplier and then
paying the supplier’s bills—on the contrary, some oversight will always be neces-
sary to handle any problems that may arise, such as complaints from suppliers
that are not being paid, verifications that discounts are being taken, and approvals
of all payments prior to payment. These activities are most commonly handled at
the level of an assistant controller, though the controller may manage the supplier
directly if the transaction volume is minimal. In all cases, some continuing over-
sight by the remaining accounting staff is necessary.

One should also consider the degree and form of ongoing interaction with
the supplier necessary to ensure that accounts payable are processed correctly.
For example, if a company has a fully integrated accounting and manufacturing
software package, it will be impossible for the supplier to process accounts

payable on its own accounting software, because these transactions must be com-
pleted on the company’s software package. The best way to resolve this problem
is to give the supplier remote access to the company’s computer system, so that it
can process accounts payable as though it were an on-site service. However, this
arrangement will require an extra expenditure to train the supplier’s employees in
how to use the system. Another option is to have the supplier perform only the
most mundane accounts payable tasks, such as matching documents, and leave
any data-entry or check-cutting work to the in-house staff. This option eliminates
the worst drudge work from the function, while still allowing for greater control
over it. Yet another variation is to allow the supplier to cut checks in payment of
accounts payable, though this reduces some company control over cash flows.
The best way to resolve the problem is to have company management approve
check runs before they are printed and mailed. Clearly, there are a variety of
approaches to the extent to which the accounts payable function can be out-
sourced.

3-22 OUTSOURCE VAT RECLAMATIONS

It is in the best interests of all countries that collect value-added taxes (VAT) to
retain these remittances as long as possible, even if a company is entitled to a
refund for various reasons. To this end, the reclamation process is not only long,
but also varies from country to country. In many cases, a company does not want to
go through the effort of reclaiming funds, choosing instead to ignore the problem.

The aggravation of reclaiming VAT taxes can be shifted to a third party that
specializes in VAT recoveries. Such parties usually charge a minimum fee per
collection effort, as well as a percentage of the amount collected. Since a com-
pany would otherwise rarely collect the money at all, paying this fee is a reason-
able way to reclaim VAT. Examples of VAT reclamation companies are Ireland-
based Fexco (www.fexcotaxreclaim.com), Meridian (a subsidiary of PRGSchultz
Inc., located on the Web at www.meridianvat.com), and England-based The VAT
Clearinghouse (www.thevatclearinghouse.com).

3-23 SHRINK THE SUPPLIER BASE

Part of the job of the accounts payable staff is to maintain a complete and accu-
rate database of suppliers, which typically includes address and payment infor-
mation. If data is entered incorrectly, the accounting staff is usually notified by a
supplier that has not received a payment (because it was sent to the wrong


50 Accounts Payable Best Practices

address), has been paid the wrong amount (because of an incorrect early payment
discount rate), or has been paid at the wrong time (because of an incorrect due
date). This type of problem is inevitable in even the best-run company and will
require some time to research and fix. However, the problem is greatly exacer-
bated in a company that has many suppliers, because there are so many chances
for the supplier information to be incorrect. Another problem with having many
suppliers is that there is typically little control over adding new suppliers (after
all, that is how there came to be so many suppliers in the first place!). The
accounting staff must deal constantly with adding new data to the supplier data-
base, consolidating supplier records that have been entered multiple times, and
(especially) making a multitude of small payments to a plethora of suppliers.
Wouldn’t it be much easier if there were just fewer suppliers?

This is a best practice—reducing the number of suppliers. It is much easier to
maintain accurate data in a relatively small number of supplier records, while there
are few new suppliers to add to the database. In addition, the volume of purchases
from the smaller number of suppliers tends to be larger, so there are typically
fewer, larger invoices that can be keypunched more easily into the accounting
database and paid with fewer, larger checks. Essentially, shrinking the supplier
database reduces a variety of data-entry tasks.

Unfortunately, shrinking the number of suppliers is not easy. The first prob-
lem is that the accounting staff must convince the purchasing staff to adopt a sup-
plier reduction strategy, which the purchasing staff may not be so eager to pursue,
especially if they prefer the strategy of sourcing parts from multiple suppliers. In
addition, company employees may be in the habit of buying from any supplier they
want, which can require a considerable amount of retraining before they are willing
to buy from a much shorter list of approved suppliers. The effort required to reduce
the number of suppliers is frequently far in excess of the productivity gains real-
ized by the accounts payable staff, so most controllers do not pursue this best
practice unless there is already either an active supplier reduction campaign in
place in the company, or else the head of the purchasing department appears to be
amenable to the idea. Even then, a supplier reduction strategy does not take place
overnight. On the contrary, it can take years to effect a massive cutback in the
supplier base. Accordingly, this strategy should only be adopted when there is
multidepartmental support for the idea as well as a long implementation timeline.

3-24 WITHHOLD FIRST PAYMENT UNTIL W-9 FORM IS RECEIVED

Within one month after the calendar year is complete, the accounts payable
department must issue completed 1099 forms to a variety of business entities,
detailing how much money the company paid them during the year. The IRS uses
its copy of this information to ensure that the revenue reported by the recipients is


3-25 Automate Payments for Repetitive Invoicing 51

correct. The trouble for the issuing company is that many potential recipients do
not want to report income to the government, and so will refuse to fill out a W-9
form or to supply a taxpayer identification number to the company. Thus, com-
pleting 1099 forms by the IRS-mandated due date can be a substantial problem.

A simple way to avoid this issue is to withhold payment of a company’s first
payment to a supplier until it completes and submits a W-9 form to the company.
By doing so, the accounts payable staff avoids the year-end hassle of determining
who receives a 1099 form. This step does add work to the check-processing func-
tion, but eliminates so much more work when the 1099 forms are issued that the
extra labor is worth it. This best practice can put the accounts payable staff under
some pressure from the materials management department if that group is trying
to obtain rapid delivery of crucial parts from a new supplier who wants payment
in advance. In most other instances, there will be little in-house opposition to this
system.

3-25 AUTOMATE PAYMENTS FOR REPETITIVE INVOICING

The typical company has a small proportion of invoices that arrive at regular
intervals and are for the same amount, month after month. Examples of such pay-
ments are rent invoices or lease payments. These payments usually go through
the typical accounts payable matching process, including searches for approval
documents, before they are paid. However, it is possible to utilize their repetitive
nature to create a more efficient subprocess within the accounts payable area.

The simple best practice that streamlines repetitive supplier invoices is to create
a payment schedule to bypass the approval process and automatically issue a check
in a prespecified amount and on a prespecified date. This can be done by creating a
table of repetitive payments in the accounting computer system; but there is no reason
why the programming expense cannot be avoided by just listing the payments on a
piece of paper and posting it in the accounts payable area. In either case, there is no
need to look for approvals, so there is less labor required of the accounts payable
staff. However, there are two problems. First, the repetitive payment schedule must
note the termination date of each payment, so that checks are not inadvertently
issued after the final payment date. These payments can be time-consuming when
the supplier returns them, if the company even notices the overpayment at all. Sec-
ond, the repetitive payments may change from time to time, so the schedule must
note both the dates when payment amounts change and the amounts of the changes.
For example, rental payments frequently contain preset escalation clauses, which
must be recognized by the repetitive payment schedule.

An especially fine use for repetitive invoicing is the remittance of garnish-
ments to various courts on behalf of employees. In the case of child support pay-
ments, these garnishments may go on for years, and usually in the same amount
through the entire period (unless the court orders that a different amount be with-


52 Accounts Payable Best Practices

held from time to time). Repetitive invoicing is quite useful here, because a com-
pany is liable to the court to make these payments, and can be subject to onerous
penalties if it does not do so. By shifting the burden of making this payment to
the computer system, there is less risk of not making the payment.

Automating repetitive payments that occur in the same amounts and on the
same dates is a good way to remove the approval step from the accounts payable
process, though this improvement typically only covers a small percentage of the
total workload of the accounts payable staff.

3-26 ELIMINATE MANUAL CHECKS

The accounts payable process can be streamlined through the use of many best
practices that are listed in this chapter; however, a common recurring problem is
those payments that go around the entire preplanned payable process. These are
the inevitable payments that are sudden and unplanned and that must be handled
immediately. Examples are payments for pizza deliveries, flowers for bereaved
employees, or cash-on-delivery payments. In all of these cases, the accounting
staff must drop what it is doing, create a manual check, get it signed, and enter
the information on the check into the computer system. To make matters worse,
due to the rush basis of the payment, it is common for the accounting person to
forget to make the entry into the computer system, which throws off the bank rec-
onciliation work at the end of the month, which creates still more work to track
down and fix the problem. In short, issuing manual checks significantly worsens
the efficiency of the accounts payable staff.

One can use two methods to reduce the number of manual checks. The first
method is to cut off the inflow of check requests, while the second is (paradoxi-
cally) to automate the cutting of manual checks. The first approach is a hard one,
since it requires tallying the manual checks that were cut each month and follow-
ing up with the check requesters to see if there might be a more orderly manner
of making requests in the future, thereby allowing more checks to be issued
through the normal accounts payable process. Unfortunately, this practice
requires so much time communicating with the check requesters that the lost time
will overtake the resulting time savings by the accounting staff from writing
fewer manual checks. The second, and better, approach, is to preset a printer with
check stock, so that anyone can request a check at any time, and an accounting
person can immediately sit down at a computer terminal, enter the check infor-
mation, and have it print out at once. This approach has the unique benefit of
avoiding any trouble with not reentering information into the computer system,
since it is being entered there in the first place (which avoids any future problems
with the bank reconciliation). It tends to take slightly longer to create a check in
this manner, but the overall time savings are greater. If one adopts this approach,


3-28 Incorporate Copy Protection Features into Checks 53

it is important to consider the cost of the printer. As it is generally a more expen-
sive tractor-feed model, this approach is probably not cost-effective unless there
are a substantial number of manual checks being created.

A third alternative is to make the process of creating a manual check so diffi-
cult that requesters will avoid this approach. For example, the request may
require the signature of a senior manager (who will be less than happy to be inter-
rupted for the signature) or multiple approving signatures. In addition, the
accounting department could charge an exorbitant amount for this service to the
requesting department on the corporate financial statements. Further, a report
itemizing all manual check requests can be sent to senior management each
month, highlighting who is bothering the accounting staff with these items. Any
combination of these actions should reduce the use of manual checks.

3-27 HAVE REGULARLY SCHEDULED CHECK-SIGNING MEETINGS

If company management insists on signing all checks, as opposed to the use of
signature stamps, then the accounts payable staff must either track down these
people and loom threateningly over them while they sign the checks, or else
meekly leave piles of checks on their desks and hope to receive the completed
checks back within not too many weeks. Either approach is unacceptable, since
the first puts the accounting staff in the uncomfortable position of forcing managers
to interrupt their workdays in order to sign checks, while the latter approach
interferes with the timely distribution of checks to suppliers and employees.

A good way to resolve this difficulty is to arrange for regularly scheduled
check-signing meetings, preferably immediately after scheduled check runs. By
doing so, managers will have already blocked out time for this work and will feel
less compelled to drop other work to complete their signing duties. Also, it means
that the accountant delivering the checks can sit and amicably discuss issues with
the check signer, such as queries about the reason for some payments, while also
presenting issues on behalf of the accounting department. Because of the
increased level of communication available under this approach, it is not unusual
for an assistant controller to deliver the checks, rather than an accounting clerk.

3-28 INCORPORATE COPY PROTECTION FEATURES
INTO CHECKS

Though rare, check counterfeiters occasionally either modify a check created by
a company or create an entirely new one, resulting in significant losses to the

company. There are a number of check protection features available that one can
incorporate into the company check stock in order to thwart the efforts of coun-
terfeiters. Here are some of the features that can be ordered from the check
printer:

¢ “Void” image. When a check is copied, the word “Void” appears multiple times
on the copied version of the check. This makes it impossible for a counter-
feiter to create clean color copies of a check.

¢ Microprinting border. Text can be added along the edges of a check using very
small fonts, so they are only visible as text when magnified. When copied, they
appear as a line, with no discernible wording visible. This is a less obvious
way to deter the efforts of someone attempting to color-copy a check.

¢ Modified background in dollar space. A set of wavy lines can be designed
into the check, in the area where the dollar amount is printed on the check. By
doing so, counterfeiters will have a very difficult time erasing existing dollar
amounts without visibly damaging the background.

¢ Watermark. A watermark can be added to a check that is only visible when
seen from an angle and that is impossible to duplicate when a check is run
through a copier. This technique is most effective when the check contains a
warning not to accept the check unless the watermark can be seen.

3-29 ISSUE ACH PAYMENTS WITH REMITTANCE DETAIL

Larger companies have been able to pay for invoices with Automated Clearing
House (ACH) transfers for some time. Their accounting systems create a file of
the amounts to be paid and link this to a file containing the banking information
for their suppliers. This file is sent to the company bank, which processes ACH
payments overnight that appear in the bank accounts of suppliers by the next
morning. One problem: The suppliers have no supporting detail for the payments
except for the name of the initiating party, which appears in the information
transmitted by the bank. The result is a callback to the company, asking for the
detail so the supplier can properly post the receipt information in its accounting
system. This extra contact essentially eliminates the time saved by the originating
company when it first set up the ACH payment system. Some companies have
created a system that issues separate payment notifications by mail, but this extra
system requires manual labor and results in supporting detail that arrives in the
mail days later than the payment.


3-30 Substitute Petty Cash for Checks 55

A good alternative for larger companies is the PayBase Electronically Sent
Payment module, produced by Bottomline Technologies (www.bottomline.com).
This software can be linked through a custom interface to any existing accounting
package. It creates standard files from accounting records that meet ACH transac-
tion formatting standards, automatically transmits this information to the company
bank, and—the key part—automatically sends remittance details to the customer
by e-mail or fax. Given the slight delay in the transfer of ACH funds, this means
that the remittance detail may actually arrive at the supplier before the payment,
thereby giving the supplier warning to check its bank account for incoming funds
the next morning. This application can be used not only for payments to suppliers,
but also to employees for both payroll and expense reimbursements.

However, this is an expensive software package that requires the construc-
tion of a customized interface between the software and a company’s existing
accounting software package. The total price puts this best practice out of reach
of most smaller companies.

3-30 SUBSTITUTE PETTY CASH FOR CHECKS

Cutting and issuing a check is a lengthy, multistep process. One must match a
supplier invoice to a purchase order and receiving document, enter the invoice
into the computer, wait for the due date, and then print the check, have it signed,
and mail it to the supplier. For small payments where the supplier shows up at the
company offices, there is a simpler way.

It is much easier to pay a supplier from the petty-cash box. This approach
eliminates the entire process needed to cut a check. However, there are some
severe limitations on the use of petty cash that limit its effectiveness to a small
number of situations. First, since the intention is to bypass the usual checks and
balances of the accounts payable process, it must only apply to those payments
that are so small that no one cares if the system is bypassed. In most companies,
the amount that can be paid with minimal controls is usually below $100. For
amounts larger than this, the usual check-paying process is probably better, since
it requires tighter control over payment approvals. Another problem is that it
makes little sense to stuff money into an envelope and mail it to the supplier,
since the money can be intercepted and removed at many points along the way,
resulting in no payment. Consequently, it is better to hand the money directly to a
supplier representative, who should be on the company premises to sign for the
money. By limiting the use of petty cash to small amounts and on-site payments,
one can effectively reduce this option to a small percentage of the total amount
that most companies pay out. Nonetheless, it is a simple and effective approach
that will result in some decrease in the volume of transactions flowing through
the typical accounts payable system.


56 Accounts Payable Best Practices

Some control is needed if petty cash is used as a regular form of payment.
One key item is to require a signed receipt for all moneys handed out, preferably
with an accompanying invoice from the supplier. This provides sufficient evi-
dence of why an expense was incurred and covers the company if the supplier
claims that it was never paid. Also, there should be a monthly reconciliation of
the petty-cash box to ensure that all expenditures and replenishments are
accounted for. It is particularly important when there is a high volume of pay-
ments going out of the petty-cash box, since there is a potential for thousands of
dollars to disappear over time if there is not a constant reconciliation. Finally,
given the high volume of usage, it is important to give control of the petty-cash
box to a single person who will accept responsibility for the money. When
accompanied by storage in a locked container, these measures present an effec-
tive set of controls over continual petty-cash disbursements.

3-31 SUBSTITUTE WIRE TRANSFERS FOR CHECKS

It is possible to save some of the labor associated with check payments by con-
verting to wire transfers, though one must be aware of the changes in costs that
will result.

Paying with a wire transfer involves entering each supplier’s identifying
bank number and account number into a computer database, which the account-
ing software then uses to compile a listing of wire transfer payments instead of
check payments. It is common for someone to review this list of wire transfers
before it is sent to a bank (in case there are obvious errors in the amounts to be
paid), at which point the information is electronically transmitted to a bank,
which immediately deducts the money from the company’s bank account and
transfers it to the accounts of the recipients. This process completely avoids all of
the check-cutting steps outlined at the beginning of this chapter.

However, there are other steps and costs associated with using wire trans-
fers that one must be aware of before using them. First, it is no longer possible
to take advantage of the mail float that goes with check payments (the time inter-
val before the recipient actually receives the check and cashes it), so a company
will lose some interest income. This problem can be avoided by delaying the
wire transfer payments to match the payment delay associated with mail float.
Another issue is the cost of each wire transfer. A company will be charged a fee
by its bank for every wire transfer it handles. The fee may go down if there is a
large wire transfer volume, but the cost will still probably exceed the mailing
cost of sending a supplier a check. However, if a company maintains a large cash
balance at the bank, it is possible that the bank will reduce or eliminate these
costs in exchange for keeping the cash invested at the bank. The last problem
with wire transfers is the one that keeps many companies from using this best


3-32 Use Signature Stamp 57

practice: The wire transfer does not contain any information about what is being
paid, so a company must still mail a remittance advice that lists each item. This
means that a company must still mail something to the supplier, so it loses any
prospect of savings in this area. However, with the advent of the Internet, it is
possible for a company to send remittance advises to its suppliers by e-mail,
avoiding having to mail this information. Linking an e-mail remittance advice to
a wire transfer is not yet available on any accounting software packages, so a
company would have to customize its accounting software with special pro-
gramming to make this happen. Consequently, one must factor in the cost of the
programming when deciding to use e-mail transmissions.

Given the large number of issues surrounding the use of wire transfers, it is
clear that a company considering its use should carefully weigh all the costs and
benefits before implementing this best practice. Because of the large number of
issues associated with it, usually only larger companies with large check volumes
are tempted to install it.

3-32 USE SIGNATURE STAMP WV Author’s Choice

One of the most common delay points in the accounts payable process is when an
accounting clerk must go in search of someone to sign checks. If there is only one
person who is so authorized, and who is not always available, it can keep any
checks from being issued at all. The situation grows worse when multiple signa-
tures are required for larger checks. On top of these delays, it is also common for
the check-signers to require back-up documents for each check being signed,
which requires a considerable extra effort by the accounting staff, not only to clip
the correct documents to each check, but also to unclip the documents after the
checks are signed and file them away in the appropriate files (which also
increases the risk that the documents will be filed in the wrong place). This is an
exceptional waste of time, since it does not add a whit of value to the process.
The solution to the multitude of inefficiencies related to check-signing is to
get rid of the check-signers completely. Instead of assuming that there must be a
complete review of all checks prior to signing, one must get management used to
the idea of installing approvals earlier in the process, thus eliminating approval at
the point of signing. Once management is comfortable with this idea, it is a simple
matter of complying with bank regulations, which require a signature on each
“check” —this is now a matter of finding the easiest way to stamp checks, rather
than an approval process. Check-stamping can be accomplished most simply by
creating a signature stamp from the signature of an authorized check-signer,
which requires that someone stamp all checks by hand. A more efficient, though
more complicated, approach is to digitize an authorized signature and incorporate


58 Accounts Payable Best Practices

it into the check-printing program, so that the signature is automatically affixed to
each check with no manual intervention.

The only problem with a signature stamp is that it can be misused to sign
unauthorized checks or legal documents. This problem can be avoided by locking
it up in the company safe and severely limiting access to the safe. It may also be
necessary to lock up check stock, thereby making it doubly difficult for anyone to
issue an unauthorized signed check.

By using a signature stamp, one can eliminate the time wasted to find a
check-signer, while also avoiding the work required to attach back-up documents
to checks and then file these documents subsequent to review. This is one of the
easiest best practices to implement and should be one of the first ones that a con-
troller should institute.

3-33 CREATE DIRECT PURCHASE INTERFACES TO SUPPLIERS

A common practice when purchasing is to issue a separate purchase order to a
supplier whenever a company wants to buy additional items. One solution to this
problem is to consolidate all the purchase orders into a single large one that cov-
ers a long time period, which is called a blanket purchase order. This best practice
is described later in this chapter in the ‘““Use Blanket Purchase Orders” section.
Though an excellent approach, it is sometimes possible to eliminate the purchase
order entirely by using a direct purchase interface to a supplier.

This best practice involves creating a computer or fax linkage to a supplier,
so that employees can order supplies directly from the supplier. By doing so, the
purchasing staff does not have to become involved in any purchases and the
accounts payable staff does not have to match any purchase orders to supplier
invoices, thereby saving time in two departments. Though a clear efficiency
improvement, this approach must be used with care because it eliminates some
control over purchases. Accordingly, it is usually only used for the purchase of
small-dollar items that are bought on a repetitive basis. Good examples of suppliers
that might be used for this approach are office or maintenance supply vendors. In
these cases, a company can create a standard form that only includes certain
products. Employees are allowed to fill out the form with any quantity they want
(within reason) and fax or mail it to the supplier, which uses it as authorization to
send goods to the company. A more advanced version of this format is to set up
the form on e-mail or on an electronic form directly linked to a supplier’s customer
orders database, for instant electronic transmission to the supplier. This latter
approach is faster and may allow a supplier to directly input an order into its
computer system, eliminating keypunching errors. By using a preset form for
ordering, a company can effectively curtail purchases to a few preselected items
that do not require further control.


3-34 Create On-line Purchasing Catalog 59

The accounting staff will know in advance that any billings from the suppliers
to which employees send orders directly do not require purchase order matching,
and so they will expend less effort on paperwork prior to releasing a payment—
just match the supplier’s invoice to receiving documents to prove that the billed
items were really received. Though this is not an approach that can be applied to
all purchases, given the inherent lack of control, it can be used in a few cases,
resulting in increased accounts payable processing efficiency.

Cost: Sr Installation time:

3-34 CREATE ON-LINE PURCHASING CATALOG

The typical purchasing process involves the creation of a purchase requisition by
whomever needs to buy something; this is used by the purchasing staff to search
for the lowest price offered by a supplier, at which point a purchase order is
issued to the appropriate supplier. The accounting department then has to match
the receiving documentation to the purchase order and supplier invoice before
generating a payment. This cumbersome process is being dismantled in many
instances through the use of an on-line purchasing catalog.

When a user buys through an on-line catalog, he or she scrolls through a list
of standard products that have been compiled by the purchasing staff, and selects
the appropriate item. This automatically places an order on an electronic pur-
chase order, on which is noted the number of the blanket purchase order that has
already been negotiated with the supplier from which the item is being bought.
The computer system then sends either an electronic or paper-based order to the
supplier, which fills the order. Upon receipt, the receiving department checks off
the item in the on-line system, which flags the accounting system to make a pay-
ment to the supplier.

This on-line catalog approach has the exceptional benefit of significantly
reducing the workload of the purchasing and accounting staffs, to the point where
they are simply monitoring the flow of transactions, rather than directly creating
them. It also channels the flow of purchases through a small set of preapproved
suppliers, so there is little chance that a new supplier will be foisted on the pur-
chasing staff by an employee. However, there are also downsides to this approach.
The required software is a major programming project that will be quite expen-
sive to create. Also, the time required to set up blanket purchase orders with a
number of suppliers will be very time-consuming, requiring a long lead time to
complete the project. Finally, it cannot be used for inventory purchases, since these
are driven by production requirements rather than employee needs. Nonetheless,
a large corporation can experience a dramatic decline in the amount of manual
procurement transactions by implementing an on-line purchasing catalog.

60 Accounts Payable Best Practices

3-35 USE BLANKET PURCHASE ORDERS

One of the most time-consuming parts of the accounts payable process is match-
ing supplier invoices to purchase orders to ensure that all payments have been
authorized. This task is a difficult one if there are a multitude of supplier purchase
orders. In the typical company, there are hundreds if not thousands of open pur-
chase orders at any time; it is standard practice to issue a separate purchase order
every time an item is purchased. However, by shrinking the number of purchase
orders to be matched, one can reduce the workload of the accounts payable staff.

A best practice that vastly reduces the number of purchase orders is blanket
purchase orders. These are long-term purchase orders, typically extending for a
one-year time period, which cover all of the expected purchases from a supplier
for that entire time period. By using blanket purchase orders, the accounts
payable staff can continually match to the same purchase orders for the entire
year, reducing the number of purchase orders that must be kept on hand.

This best practice is a simple one to implement from the accounting perspec-
tive. There is no change in the way the accounting staff stores or matches blanket
purchase orders. They will continue to staple the purchase order to the invoice
and move it on for further processing. The only difference is that because the
amounts on the blanket purchase orders are so large, they will hardly ever be
equaled by a single supplier delivery. The accounting clerk must instead make a
facsimile of each purchase order and staple the copy to the supplier invoice. This
is a minor change and will be easily accepted by the accounting staff when they
see that, in exchange, the volume of purchase orders has dropped significantly.

Though this seems like a best practice that should be implemented at once
due to the obvious benefits, one should consider the problem of working with an
extra department to ensure that the new system works. The problem with a blan-
ket purchase order is that it cannot be implemented without the cooperation of
the purchasing staff and the suppliers. Since there are many more entities
involved in this implementation, it is no surprise that relatively few companies
have implemented this best practice. To ensure that blanket purchase orders are
used, one must discuss the benefits of the system with the purchasing manager
(who will see a significant decline in paperwork as a result of using blanket pur-
chase orders). The purchasing manager must buy into the concept because this is
the person who must in turn sell the concept to suppliers. Another problem is that
a typical company has so many suppliers that it takes a substantial amount of
time to implement blanket purchase order agreements with all of them. Instead, it
is frequently easier to either pare down the number of suppliers or just implement
blanket purchase orders with the 20 percent of suppliers with which a company
typically does 80 percent of its business. Either approach will allow a company to
enter into blanket purchase orders with suppliers that will substantially reduce the
total number of blanket purchase orders.

3-38 Create Different Supplier Accounts for Different Terms 61

3-36 ADD SUPPLIER 800-NUMBERS TO MASTER FILE

When there are problems with an invoice submitted by a supplier, an accounts
payable staff person must call the supplier to discuss the issue. If the problem
requires a lengthy discussion, or the supplier is located far away, the company
may find itself incurring substantial phone charges to resolve issues that are not
even its fault.

This problem can be resolved by including the 800-number for each supplier
in the computer master file, assuming there is such a number. By doing so, the
accounting staff can readily access the toll-free number and use it to contact the
supplier. After all, if the supplier caused the problem, it should pay for the call
required to resolve it.

Cost: SS Installation time:

3-37 ASSIGN PAYABLES STAFF TO SPECIFIC SUPPLIERS

When suppliers call a company to check on the status of payments, the clerical
staff must research the information prior to giving a response. This can require a
substantial amount of clerical time, and can also yield differing replies to suppli-
ers if they call the company several times, resulting in supplier frustration. In
addition, incoming supplier invoices may contain special provisions that require
a detailed knowledge of the underlying purchasing contracts; otherwise, pay-
ments may be recorded improperly.

A simple way to avoid all these problems is to assign supplier accounts to
specific accounts payable staff. By doing so, the accounting staff can individually
concentrate their attention on a smaller group of suppliers, allowing them to learn
how each one presents invoices for payment and how their payment transactions
should be recorded. In addition, because of their increased knowledge level, they
can provide answers to supplier questions more quickly and with greater accuracy.

This best practice is not a useful solution for very small companies, since
there may be only one payables staff person available. It also presents problems
for suppliers if their assigned staff person is not available, so the accounting man-
ager should consider assigning a back-up person to each account.

3-38 CREATE DIFFERENT SUPPLIER ACCOUNTS
FOR DIFFERENT TERMS

Suppliers occasionally require different payment terms for different products or
services. For example, one product must be paid for within 30 days, while another

can be paid for sooner in exchange for an early payment discount. If so, the
accounts payable staff will have a hard time differentiating between the different
terms, resulting in errors that require yet more work to correct.

A possible solution is to create different computer master files for each set of
terms. By doing so, supplier invoices can be assigned to the appropriate supplier
account, resulting in accurate payment processing. However, this best practice
still requires knowing to which account a supplier invoice should be assigned.
This problem can be resolved by forcing the issue back to the supplier and having
it enter the correct supplier code on all submitted invoices, depending upon the
type of transaction submitted.

3-39 IGNORE SUPPLIER INVOICES AND PAY
FROM STATEMENTS

Many suppliers provide frequent deliveries and services, each one for small
amounts of money. They tend to send large volumes of invoices, which can inun-
date the accounts payable staff. Also, given the high volume of invoices received,
it is quite possible that some invoices will mistakenly be paid twice, especially if
there are no invoice numbers that the computer system can check for duplicate
payments.

One solution to these high-volume, low-cost invoices is to throw them all
away; then, when the suppliers send the usual month-end statement of invoices
outstanding, just record the statement in the computer system, using the state-
ment date as the invoice number, and issue a single payment from that document.
This also works well for the supplier, which receives just one check instead of
many. The only problem with this approach occurs when the underlying invoices
would normally be charged to different departments, which would require one to
see the content of those invoices. However, in most cases, these invoices are so
small that an incorrect or missing expense allocation would have little impact on
departmental financial statements.

When the accounts payable staff have a valid reason for making a deduction from
a payment to a supplier, this can result in a prolonged series of complaints from
the supplier as to why a short payment was made. The adjustment will appear on
the next monthly statement of unpaid invoices from the supplier, and will likely

end with a series of irate collection calls. At some point, the accounting staff may
feel that the cost savings from taking the deduction was not worth the effort
required to convince the supplier of the reasoning behind it.

This issue can be solved to some extent by checking off a box on a standard
adjustment letter and mailing the letter to the supplier. The letter should note the
invoice number that is at issue, as well as a series of common problems that
caused the short payment to be made. The accounting staff can quickly check off
the appropriate box and mail it out, using far less time than would be required to
construct a formal, customized letter of notification. The letter should contain
space for a free-form written description of the issue, in case it is a unique one
not covered by any of the standard explanations already listed on the letter.

TOTAL IMPACT OF BEST PRACTICES ON THE ACCOUNTS
PAYABLE FUNCTION

The preceding list of accounts payable best practices is too voluminous and over-
lapping for a company to install all of them— in fact, there is no need to do so. If
a small number of the most radical changes are implemented, such as using the
receiving personnel to approve payments to suppliers, many of the other practices
are rendered ineffective. Accordingly, this section does not attempt to describe
the impact of all the best practices. Instead, it assumes that all of the changes
requiring considerable reengineering are implemented, since they have the most
impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of the department. This leaves a much
smaller number of additional best practices to be tacked on to make a truly world-
class accounts payable function.

As just noted, the most important and far-reaching item to install is approval
of payment at the receiving dock by the receiving staff. This best practice negates
a number of incremental improvements to the accounts payable function, such as
automated three-way matching and digitizing accounts payable documents. Once
that improvement is made, the remaining best practices for the new accounts
payable functions are primarily those that deal with special payment situations
that will not be routed through the receiving dock. For example, expense reports
and repetitive payments should be automated. The number of payments can also
be reduced by using procurement cards to consolidate the number of billings
received, while blanket purchase orders are useful for shrinking the number of pur-
chase orders in the system. Another piece of automation is the use of wire trans-
fers, which avoids the time-consuming process of creating, signing, and mailing
checks. Suppliers can also be linked directly to the accounts payable database to see
if payments have been made, which avoids any regular need for the suppliers to talk
to the staff. When taken together, the accounts payable function is transformed

into a small group of highly computer-literate employees who monitor ongoing
automated transactions to ensure that all processing is proceeding in accordance
with expectations. There is very little paper-processing, nor is there much need to
correspond with suppliers. This is the accounts payable function of the future.
The combination of these best practices is noted in Exhibit 3.4.

Though the system advocated in this exhibit is certainly the most efficient one
of all the combinations of best practices presented in this section, it is important to
note that it is not for everyone. It requires substantial implementation time and cost;
accordingly, it may not be practicable for smaller companies that are operating on
a limited budget. In these cases, other combinations of best practices can be used
to create a system that is somewhat less efficient, but at a much lower cost.

SUMMARY

This chapter itemized a number of best practices that can be used to vastly
streamline the accounts payable function, one of the most labor-intensive
accounting functions. Of all the functional areas, this is the one that can yield the
most impressive productivity gains with the use of best practices.

One can select a series of small and simple changes, such as using signature
stamps and auditing expense reports, to make incremental improvements in the
accounts payable process. However, this is an area where massive gains are pos-
sible if a controller is willing to completely restructure the traditional accounts
payable processing approach. To this end, the most important best practice listed
in this chapter is that of paying upon receiving approval—the receiving staff
authorizes payment simply by looking up all items received in an on-line database
of open purchase orders. No further work is required by the accounts payable
staff, resulting in a major reduction in the accounting workload. However, this
approach requires new computer systems, as well as a complete retraining of
the receiving staff regarding their role in paying suppliers. Only through such
paradigm shifts can an accounting department achieve sensational productivity
improvements in the area of accounts payable.

Billing Best Practices

This chapter covers the best practices that can be used to create a more efficient
billing operation. The best practices fall into three main categories. One group
covers the need for more accurate information that is used to create an invoice.
These items focus on the stream of information going from the shipping depart-
ment to the invoicing staff, with a particular emphasis on rooting out any missing
or incorrect information. The next group of best practices covers the efficiency of
the invoicing operation itself, eliminating month-end statements and using a
smaller number of multipart invoice forms. The final group focuses on changing
the method of invoice delivery to the customer, such as using electronic data
interchange or allowing the delivery person to create the invoice at the point of
delivery. When taken as a whole, these best practices result in an invoicing opera-
tion that is remarkably error-free, issues invoices as soon as products are shipped,
and ensures that customers receive invoices almost at once.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES FOR BILLING BEST PRACTICES

The best practices in this chapter comprise a broad mix of issues that are easily
put in place and others that are much more challenging to implement, depending
on a company’s specific circumstances. This section contains a table (Exhibit 4.1)
that lists the best practices and then describes the cost and duration of implemen-
tation for each one. The most difficult ones are those that require extra computer
programming to achieve, as well as those that require the cooperative efforts of
other departments. The easiest ones can generally be achieved within the account-
ing department and with no additional capital or personnel costs of note. The
implementation issues for billing best practices are as follows.

Some of the most difficult implementation jobs result in the greatest improve-
ments in the performance of the billing function. Accordingly, it is best to alter-
nate easy implementations with more difficult ones so that there is a constant
stream of successes, some of which represent significant advances in efficiency.
Also, by including an occasional “quick-hit” implementation, a controller can
point toward a continuing stream of successes, which is useful when trying to
obtain funds for more best practices—related projects.

The remainder of this chapter describes the best practices that were itemized
in Exhibit 4.1. Each description includes the benefits and problems associated

68 Billing Best Practices

4-1 ADD CARRIER ROUTE CODES TO BILLING ADDRESSES

For those organizations that issue large quantities of small-dollar invoices, the
cost of mailing is a substantial portion of the total cost of doing business. For
these organizations, a lower-cost approach to mailing an invoice must be found.
One alternative is to include a carrier route code in the address field for each cus-
tomer. This information is used by the postal service to more easily sort incoming
mail pieces by carrier route. In exchange for this information, the postal service
allows a small reduction in the cost of each item mailed. At the time of this writing,
the difference between the standard price for an automated letter-size mailing and
one that includes the carrier route code is about three cents (for the most recent
rates, go to www.usps.com). This difference is sufficiently large that a billing
manager who processes thousands of invoices per year should certainly consider
it as a potential way to save costs.

To implement this best practice, one must obtain the route codes from the
postal service on either a monthly or bimonthly basis. They are available on tape,
CD-ROM, cartridge, or hard copy. The company’s customer address files must be
updated with the latest carrier route information, as specified in the postal ser-
vice’s Domestic Mail Manual. To determine the exact format of the file, one can
download a sample file from the postal service’s Web site. These steps obviously
require some effort on a continuing basis, so one must carefully determine the
cost-benefit associated with this best practice before implementing it. Realisti-
cally, only a very large mailing operation will save money through this approach.

4-2 HAVE DELIVERY PERSON DELIVER THE INVOICE

Accompany may not have the wherewithal to create invoices at the point of delivery,
as described later in the “Have Delivery Person Create the Invoice” section. How-
ever, it may still be possible to have the delivery person hand-carry the invoice at
the time of delivery to the customer’s accounts payable department. By doing so,
a company can compress the mail time that would otherwise be required to get an
invoice to a customer and ensure that the invoice is delivered directly into the
hands of the person who is responsible for paying it. Thus, direct delivery of an
invoice carries with it the advantages of reducing the total transaction time, while
also ensuring that the invoice is not lost in transit.

However, having the delivery person deliver the invoice only works in a small
number of situations. The key element is that a company must make deliveries
with its own personnel; if not, a third-party delivery person will not hand-carry an
invoice, which makes this best practice impossible to implement. Also, there must be
a close linkage between the accounting department and the shipping dock, so that
invoices are prepared slightly in advance of shipment and sent to the delivery person

at the time of shipment. In addition, a customer may not allow delivery personnel to
have access to the accounting department, resulting in the delivery of the invoice to
the customer’s front desk, which may result in a delayed or incorrect delivery to the
accounting department. Finally, there may be a problem with creating invoices
slightly in advance of shipment—what if the invoice is created but the shipment
never leaves the dock? The invoice must then be credited out of the computer sys-
tem, which adds an unneeded step to the invoicing process. Consequently, given
the number of problems with this best practice, it is best used in only a few situa-
tions, where a company has its own delivery staff and the accounting department
can efficiently produce accurate invoices either in advance of, or at the time of,
shipment.

Though there seem to be many obstacles to this best practice, there is one
scenario under which it can work very well. If the shipping dock has a computer
terminal and printer, it may be possible to create an invoice at the dock as soon as
a delivery is ready for shipment. This alternative keeps the accounting staff from
having to be involved in the invoicing process at all and keeps invoices from being
produced by mistake when a delivery is not actually ready for shipment. This alter-
native requires a modification to the accounting system, so that invoices can be
produced singly, rather than in batches, which is the customary mode of invoice
creation. The shipping staff also must be given permission to create invoices in
the computer system, and must be thoroughly trained in how to do so. If these
problems can be overcome, an incremental increase in the level of technology
used at the shipping dock can make this best practice a viable alternative.

4-3 DO EARLY BILLING OF RECURRING
INVOICES WV Author’s Choice

There are many situations in which a company knows the exact amount of a cus-
tomer billing well before the date on which the invoice is to be sent. For example,
a subscription is for the preset amount, as is a contractual obligation, such as a
rent payment. In these cases, it makes sense to create the invoice and deliver it to
the customer one or two weeks in advance of the date when it is actually due. By
doing so, the invoice has more time to be routed through the receiving organiza-
tion, passing through the mailroom, accounting staff, authorized signatory, and
back to the accounts payable staff for payment. This makes it much more likely
that the invoice will be paid on time, which improves cash flow and reduces a
company’s investment in accounts receivable.

The main difficulty with advance billings is that the date of the invoice
should be shifted forward to the accounting period in which the invoice is sup-
posed to be billed. Otherwise, the revenue will be recognized too early, which
distorts the financial statements. Shifting the accounting period forward is not


70 Billing Best Practices

difficult for most accounting software systems, but the controller must remember
to shift back to the current period after the invoice processing has been com-
pleted; otherwise, all other current transactions that are subsequently entered will
be recorded in the next accounting period, rather than the current one.

4-4 ISSUE ELECTRONIC INVOICES THROUGH THE INTERNET

The traditional invoicing process is extraordinarily wasteful in terms of the effort
and time that goes into creating and issuing an invoice. It must be created and
inserted into an invoice printing batch, which in turn requires the use of a cus-
tomized invoice with prepositioned fields and logos, plus a review of the printed
invoices, stuffing into envelopes, affixing postage, and mailing. Even then, there
is a risk that the invoice will be lost in the mail, either due to a problem at the post
office or because the recipient’s address has changed. Further, there are delays at
the receiving company, while the mailroom sorts through the mail and delivers it
internally (sometimes to the wrong person).

Some of these problems can be avoided through the use of e-mailed billings
that are delivered through the Internet. There are several ways to do this. The
least-recommended approach is to post the invoices on a company’s own Web
site. This means that customers can access the company’s credit card payment
system at the same time they access their invoices, which results in accounts
receivable that are collected with inordinate speed. However, this approach requires
customers to access the company’s Web site in order to find their invoices, which
they are not likely to do (especially because this will result in their immediate use
of funds to pay for the invoice). In addition, this requires an interface between the
accounting database and the Web site, so that invoices are posted regularly to the
Web site. Further, there may be a need to create user identification numbers and
passwords, so that they can access their invoices (otherwise they would be view-
able by all visitors to the Web site). Also, if customers forget their access codes,
there must be an internal customer service function that can assist them with this
information, and this involves additional personnel costs to maintain.

A better approach is to “push” electronic invoices to customers by e-mail.
This requires the collection of an e-mail address from each customer at the time
an order is taken (or verification of an existing one when a reorder occurs). This
address is then attached to an electronic invoice form that is generated, instead of
a paper-based invoice, and issued to the customer over the Internet. It is then
available to the customer a few moments later, allowing for immediate payment
(possibly) or at least a quick perusal of the invoice and a return of information to
the company regarding any problems discovered by the customer. This approach
greatly reduces the time required to get invoicing information to the customer.


4-4 Issue Electronic Invoices through the Internet 71

There are several problems with Internet invoicing that one must be aware
of. First, some customers change their e-mail addresses with some regularity, so
that there is a chance that invoices will be sent to an old address, and therefore
never accessed. Also, there is some risk that customers will accidentally erase an
incoming electronic invoice without reviewing it. Furthermore, this approach
leaves no paper record of the invoice at the company, just a computer record; this
is a problem for those organizations where the collections effort is primarily
based on paper files, rather than ready access to the accounting database.

Another issue is creating the software that will in turn create an invoice
(either text-based or using the industry-standard Portable Document Format
(PDF) promulgated by Adobe Systems) and then send it to an e-mail address.
This can be a significant programming effort if done internally, and runs the addi-
tional risk of being wiped out if the attached packaged accounting software is
upgraded, which may destroy or alter some of the software linkages to which the
custom software is attached. Fortunately, a number of accounting software
providers are now adding this feature to their accounting systems, so that internal
programming can be avoided.

Some of the problems with e-mailed invoices can be addressed through the
careful analysis of which customers reliably pay their invoices by this means and
(more importantly) which do not. If there is a consistent problem with payment
by some customers, they can be flagged in the accounting database and a tradi-
tional paper-based invoice can be created for them. Alternatively, the same
invoices can be continually reissued every week or two by e-mail. This is a zero-
cost option, since there are no mailing or printing costs. When using this approach,
the entire file of unpaid invoices can be reissued electronically to customers.
However, to avoid multiple payments for the same invoices, it may be useful to
alter the format of these secondary issuances, so that they are clearly labeled as
reminder invoices. An alternative format is to cluster all unpaid invoices for each
customer into an electronic statement of unpaid invoices, which can be issued at
regular intervals.

The use of direct e-mails to customers is particularly enticing, not from an
accounting perspective, but from a marketing view. A complete list of customer
e-mail addresses allows one to send sales, marketing, and customer service infor-
mation to a company’s entire mailing list at the touch of a button, and with no
associated distribution cost whatsoever.

A final variation on the use of electronic invoices through the Internet is the
use of a consolidator. This is an entity that maintains a Web site that allows a
company’s customers to access not only their billings, but those of their other
suppliers, too. This approach has the distinct advantage of allowing customers to
pay a number of different bills at the same time, without switching to a number of
different Web sites in order to do so. Examples of these consolidators are Check-
free, Speedpay, and Microvault.

A company that wishes to have its invoices posted on a consolidator Web site
must create a data file that reformats the invoice information into the format


72 Billing Best Practices

needed by the consolidator, and then send this file (over the Internet) to the con-
solidator, which then posts the information. Customers then access their invoices
in a summary format, which are clustered together for all of their suppliers, and
either accept or reject them for payment; if there is a problem, customers can
access greater levels of detail for each invoice, and usually access an e-mail
account that will be sent to the company’s customer service department.

The cost of this service varies considerably by consolidator, with some charg-
ing the customer, some the company, and some charging both. It is best to refer to
the fee schedule of each one to determine the precise amounts. The fees charged to
a company are not excessive, and should not get in the way of adopting this option.

The main problem with using a consolidator is that not all customers will
want to use the one to which the company prefers to send its invoicing informa-
tion, since they may have already set up payment plans with many of their other
suppliers through different consolidators. Accordingly, a company may find itself
issuing invoice files to a large number of consolidators, which presents additional
work for the person reformatting the invoice file.

The most common of these electronic invoicing options is bill posting on a
company’s own Web site, since it is the simplest of all options. However, with the
growing use of invoice consolidators by customers, the issuance of invoices
through this medium, in addition to their posting on a company-owned Web site,
is a reasonable alternative. These are not mutually exclusive options.

Cost: ry Installation time:

4-5 ISSUE SINGLE, SUMMARIZED INVOICES EACH PERIOD

Some companies make a business out of selling small quantities of products in
small batches, which necessitates a very large quantity of invoices. For example, a
company that sells nails in batches of an ounce per sale will issue 16 more invoices
than one that sells nails in batches of no less than one pound. If the cost of issuing
an invoice is as little as $1 (and it is usually much more), then the price at which the
nails were sold will probably be far less than the cost of issuing the associated
invoices. Clearly, companies that must issue enormous numbers of invoices in this
manner will find that their administrative costs are excessive.

A way out of this dilemma is to group all sales for a specified time period, such
as a month, and then issue a single invoice that covers all of the sales during that
period. This approach, which is used by W.W. Grainger for many of its customers,
is similar to the invoicing method used by credit card companies, which congregate
all sales for a full month and then issue a single billing. By using this best practice,
a company can eliminate a very large proportion of its total invoice volume.

There are some issues to consider before using this best practice. One is that
this approach is obviously most suitable for companies that issue large quantities of
low-dollar invoices. Conversely, it is not a reasonable approach if invoice volume is


4-6 Print Separate Invoices for Each Line Item 73

low and dollar volumes are high. If a billing is for a large amount of money, it
makes little sense to wait until the end of the month to issue an invoice, since this
only delays the time period before the customer will pay for it. Another issue is
that the existing accounting software may not support this feature. If not, a com-
pany must go through the added expense of custom-programming to group a
series of shipments or sales into a single invoice. Another problem may be cus-
tomers —they are accustomed to receiving a single invoice for each shipment, with
a separate purchase order authorizing each invoice, and they will not know what to
do when a single, summary-level invoice arrives in the mail. The best way to
resolve this problem is to make it an option for customers to accept summary-level
invoices, rather than unexpectedly springing it on them with no warning and
requiring their use of it. By taking the time to explain the reason for the single
invoice and how it can benefit customers, too (with less paperwork for them to sort
through), the customer acceptance rate should be quite high. The final problem
with this method is that it takes longer to bring cash in to pay for shipped goods,
since some shipments may be sent out at the beginning of a month, but not billed
until the end of the month. To avoid this problem, a company can impose a shorter
due date in which customers must pay, but customers rarely receive this well.
Instead, it is best to carefully analyze the interest cost of the large amount of com-
mitted working capital to the reduced cost of invoicing; if there is a clear benefit
despite the added cost, then this best practice should be implemented. For many
billing departments, it should be implemented sooner rather than later.

In short, issuing a single invoice to customers each period makes a great deal
of sense for those companies that ship many small-dollar orders. Companies that
deal with large-dollar orders should probably leave this best practice alone, since
there is an added working capital cost associated with its use.

Cost: Sr Installation time:

4-6 PRINT SEPARATE INVOICES FOR EACH LINE ITEM

When an accounting department issues an invoice that contains a large number of
line items, it is more likely that the recipient will have an issue with one or more
of the line items, and will hold payment on the entire invoice while those line
items are resolved. Though this may not be a significant issue when an invoice is
relatively small, it is a large issue indeed when the invoice has a large dollar total,
and holding the entire invoice will have a serious impact on the amount of
accounts receivable outstanding.

One way to avoid this problem is to split large invoices into separate ones,
with each invoice containing just one line item. By doing so, it is more likely that
some invoices will be paid at once, while other ones for which there are issues
will be delayed. This can have a significant positive impact on a company’s
investment in accounts receivable.


74 Billing Best Practices

The only complaint that arises from this approach is that customers can be
buried under quite a large pile of invoices. This can be ameliorated by clustering
all of the invoices in a single envelope, rather than sending a dozen separately
mailed invoices on the same day. Also, it may be prudent to cluster small-dollar
line items on the same invoice, since this will cut down on the number of invoices
issued, while not having a significant impact on the overall receivable balance if
these invoices are put on hold.

4-7 TRANSMIT TRANSACTIONS VIA ELECTRONIC
DATA INTERCHANGE

Sending an invoice to a customer requires some labor, cost, and time, but does
not guarantee that the invoice will be paid. For example, someone must print out
an invoice, separate the copy that goes to the customer, stuff it in an envelope and
mail it, which may then take several days to reach the customer, be routed through
its mailroom, reach the accounts payable department, and be entered into the cus-
tomer’s computer system (where the data may be scrambled due to keypunching
errors). The invoice may even be lost at the customer site and never be entered
into its computer system for payment at all.

To avoid all of these issues, a company can use electronic data interchange
(EDI). Under this approach, a company’s computer system automatically issues
an electronic invoice that is set up in a standard format (as defined by an interna-
tional standard-setting organization) and transmits it to a third-party mainframe
computer, where it is left in an electronic mailbox. The customer’s computer
automatically polls this mailbox several times a day and extracts the electronic
invoice format. Once received, the format is automatically translated into the
invoice format used by the recipient’s computer and stored in the accounting sys-
tem’s database for payment. At no time does anyone have to manually handle the
data, which eliminates the risk of lost or erroneous invoicing data. This is an
excellent approach for those companies that can afford to invest in setting up EDI
with their customers, since it fully automates a number of invoicing steps, result-
ing in a high degree of efficiency and reliability.

There are several problems with EDI that keep most smaller companies
from using it, especially if they have many low-volume customer accounts. The
main problem is that it takes some time and persuasion to get a customer to
agree to use EDI as the basis for receiving invoices. This may take several trips
to each customer, including time to send trial transmissions to the customer’s
computer to ensure that the system works properly. To do this with a large num-
ber of low-volume customers is not cost-effective, so the practice is generally
confined to companies with high-volume customers, involving a great many
invoices, so that the investment by both parties pays off fairly quickly. The


4-8 Automatically Check Errors during Invoice Date Entry 75

other problem is that the most efficient EDI systems require some automation.
A standard EDI system requires one to manually enter all transactions, as well
as manually extract them from the EDI mailbox and keypunch them into the
receiving computer. To fully automate the system, a company must have its
software engineers program an interface between the accounting computer sys-
tem and the EDI system, which can be an expensive undertaking. Without the
interface, an EDI system is really nothing more than a fancy fax machine. Thus,
installing a fully operational EDI system is usually limited to transactions with
high-volume customers and requires a considerable programming expense to
achieve full automation.

4-8 AUTOMATICALLY CHECK ERRORS DURING
INVOICE DATA ENTRY

Errors during the data-entry phase of creating an invoice can result in a variety of
downstream problems. For example, an incorrect billing address on an invoice
means that the customer will never receive it, which means that the collections
staff must send a new invoice copy. Also, if the quantity, product description, or
price is entered incorrectly, the customer may have a good reason for not paying
the bill. If this happens, the collections staff will have to get involved to work out
the reason for nonpayment and negotiate extra payments (if possible) by customers.
All of these problems are exceptions and require very large amounts of time to
research and fix.

A very useful best practice is to prevent as many data-entry problems in
advance as possible by using computerized data-checking methods. For example,
a field for zip codes can only accept five-digit or nine-digit numbers, which pre-
vents the entry of numbers of an unusual length. The field can also be tied to a file
of all cities and states, so that entering a zip code automatically fills in the city and
state fields. Also, prices of unusual length can be automatically rejected, or prices
can be automatically called up from a file that is linked to a product number. Sim-
ilarly, product descriptions can be automatically entered if the product number is
entered. An example of a “‘smart” data-entry system is one that flags part numbers
that are being entered for an existing customer for the first time. The computer can
check the part number entered against a file of items previously ordered by a cus-
tomer and see if there is a chance that the part being ordered might not be the cor-
rect one. There can also be required fields that must have a valid entry or else the
invoice cannot be processed; a good example is the customer purchase order num-
ber field, required by many customers, or else they will not pay the invoice. By
including these automatic error-checking and expert systems into the data-entry
software, it is possible to reduce the number of data-entry errors.


76 Billing Best Practices

The main problem with creating automatic error-checking is that it can be a
significant programming project. There may be a dozen different error-checking
protocols linked to the invoice data-entry screen, and each one is a separate pro-
gramming project. Also, if a company purchased its software from a third party, it
is common for the company to periodically install software updates issued by the
supplier, which would wipe out any programming changes made in the interim.
Accordingly, it is best to apply these error-checking routines only to custom-
programmed accounting systems. An alternative is to use error-checking as a cri-
terion for the purchase of new packaged software, if a company is in the market
for a new accounting system. In either of these two cases, having automatic error-
checking is a worthy addition to an accounting system.

4-9 HAVE DELIVERY PERSON CREATE THE INVOICE

Many companies have difficulty with their customers when the company bills for
the quantity that it believes it shipped to the customer, but the customer argues
that it received a different quantity and only pays for the amount it believes it has
received. This problem results in the invoicing staff having to issue credits after
the fact, in order to reconcile the amount of cash received from customers to the
amounts that were billed to them. The amount of work required in these cases to
match the amounts billed to the amounts paid is usually greatly in excess of the
dollar amounts involved and has a profound impact on the efficiency of the
billing staff.

New technology makes it possible for some companies to completely bypass
this problem. If a company has its own delivery staff, it can equip them with
portable computers and printers and have them issue invoices at the point of
receipt, using the quantities counted by the customer as the appropriate amount to
invoice. A flowchart of the procedure is shown in Exhibit 4.2. To begin, the ship-
ping staff determines the amount to be shipped to a customer and enters this
amount into the main accounting database. The amount in a specific truckload is
downloaded into the portable computer of the delivery person, who then brings
the truckload of goods to the customer. The customer counts the amount
received. The delivery person calls up the amount of the delivery on the screen of
the portable computer, enters the quantities that the customer agrees has been
received, and prints out and delivers an invoice (which may be on a diskette if the
customer has a compatible computer system that can receive invoice data in this
fashion). The delivery person then returns to the company and uploads all invoic-
ing information from the portable computer to the main accounting database,
which records the invoices and notes any variances between the amounts shipped
and the amounts received by customers (which will be investigated if the vari-
ances are significant). It is also possible to upload information at the customer

site, either by dialing up the accounting database through a local phone connec-
tion or by using cellular phone access. This process is capable of eliminating
problems caused by customer disputes over delivered quantities, resulting in less

work for the accounting staff.

Though a technologically elegant solution, this best practice is one that
applies to only a small number of companies that meet some very specific crite-
ria. First, a company must make deliveries with its own staff; a third-party deliv-
ery service will not perform the on-site invoicing function. Next, this solution
requires a good knowledge of computer systems to implement. There must be not
only a qualified and knowledgeable in-house computer system department, but
also one that has the budget to create such a system. Also, this is an expensive
solution to implement (if only because every driver must be furnished with a

computer and printer), so there must be a clear trade-off between the implemen-
tation and capital cost of the system and benefits from reduced accounting staff
labor. These criteria tend to point toward only larger companies that make fre-
quent deliveries to a large number of customers. Smaller firms will not find that
this is a cost-effective practice to install and use.

4-10 COMPUTERIZE THE SHIPPING LOG

For a company with no computer linkage to the shipping dock, the typical
sequence of events that leads up to the creation of an invoice is that copies of the
packing slip and the initial customer order form are manually delivered to the
accounting department from the shipping dock; then the accounting staff uses
this information to create an invoice. Unfortunately, this manual transfer of infor-
mation can sometimes lead to missing documents, which means that the account-
ing department does not create an invoice and sales are lost. In addition, this sys-
tem can be a slow one—if the shipping department is a long way away from the
accounting department, perhaps in a different city, it may be several days before
the invoice can be created, which increases the time period before a customer will
receive the invoice and pay it. Finally, there is a problem with data entry, because
the accounting staff must manually reenter some or all of the customer informa-
tion before creating an invoice (depending on the amount of data already entered
into the computer system by the order-entry department). Any additional data
entry brings up the risk of incorrect information being entered on an invoice,
which may result in collection problems, especially if the data-entry error related
to an incorrect shipment quantity.

The solution to this problem is to provide for the direct entry of shipping
information by the shipping staff at the shipping location. By doing so, there is no
longer any time delay in issuing invoices, nor is there a risk that the accounting
staff will incorrectly enter shipping information into an invoice. There is still a
risk that the shipping staff will incorrectly enter information, but this is less
likely, since they are the ones who shipped the product and they are most familiar
with shipping quantities and other related information. For this system to func-
tion properly, there must be a computer terminal in the shipping area that is
directly linked to the accounting database. In addition, the shipping staff must be
properly trained in how to enter a shipment into the computer. There should also
be a continuing internal audit review of the accuracy of the data entered at this
location, to ensure that the procedure is continuing to be handled correctly.
Finally, the accounting software should have a data input screen that allows the
shipping staff to enter shipping information. These tend to be minor problems at
most companies, since there is usually a computer terminal already in or near the
shipping area, and most accounting packages are already set up to handle the

direct entry of shipping information; some even do so automatically as soon as
the shipping staff creates a bill of lading or packing slip through the computer
system. In short, unless there are very antiquated systems on hand or a poorly
trained or unreliable shipping staff, it is not normally a very difficult issue to have
the shipping employees directly enter shipping information into the accounting
system, which can then be used to immediately create and issue invoices.

4-11 TRACK EXCEPTIONS BETWEEN THE SHIPPING LOG
AND INVOICE REGISTER

If a company relies on the manual transfer of shipping information from the ship-
ping dock to the accounting department, it is likely that some shipments are never
billed, resulting in a permanent loss of revenue. This situation arises because
information can be lost on its way from the shipping dock; it can be mixed with
other paperwork, put into the wrong bin, given to the wrong person, or any num-
ber of other variations. In even the best-run companies, there is a strong chance
that, from time to time, a shipment will not be invoiced. If the shipment in ques-
tion is a high-dollar one, the cost of the missing transaction can be considerable
and may make it worthwhile to take steps to remedy the situation.

Fortunately, the solution is not a very expensive one. To avoid any missing
invoices, one must continually compare the shipping log maintained by the
shipping department with the invoice register that is maintained by the account-
ing department. Any shipment that is listed on the shipping log, but that has not
been invoiced, must be investigated at once. There may be good reasons for a
shipment that is not invoiced, such as the delivery of a free sample, but the
investigation must still be completed in order to ensure that there are no prob-
lems. If a problem is uncovered, it is not enough to just issue the missing
invoice. One must also determine the reason why the paperwork for the ship-
ment never reached the accounting department and fix the underlying problem.
Only by taking this extra step can a company keep from having a continual
problem with its invoicing. Any company that uses a manual transfer of infor-
mation between these two departments should always track exceptions between
the shipping log and invoice register.

It is also possible to avoid the entire problem by having the shipping depart-
ment record all shipments directly into the accounting database, as described in
the preceding section, ““Computerize the Shipping Log.” By using this approach,
there is no manual transfer of information, so there is no exception tracking to
perform. It is also possible to have the shipping department not only enter ship-
ments into the computer, but also print out invoices in the shipping department
for delivery with the shipments. This approach was also described earlier, in the
section “Delivery Person Creates the Invoice.” However, if the shipping area


80 Billing Best Practices

does not have the level of computerization or training to use either of these more
advanced best practices, a periodic comparison of the shipping log to the invoice
register is mandatory, in order to avoid not billing customers for shipments to
them.

4-12 ELIMINATE MONTH-END STATEMENTS

The employees who are in charge of printing and issuing invoices each day have
another document that they print and issue each month, the month-end statement.
This is a listing of all open invoices that customers have not yet paid. Though it
seems like a good idea to tell customers what they still owe, the reality of the sit-
uation is that most customers throw away their statements without reading them.
The reason is that the person receiving a statement, the accounts payable clerk,
does not have time to research strange invoices that appear on a supplier’s state-
ment, nor is it likely that this person will call the supplier to request a copy of a
missing invoice. Instead, it is easier to wait for a contact from the supplier, asking
about a specific invoice. By waiting, the onus of doing some work falls on the
supplier instead of the accounts payable person, which is a preferable shifting of
the workload from the latter person to the former.

The simple approach to eliminating this problem is to stop printing state-
ments. By doing so, one can avoid not only the time and effort of printing the
statements, but also eliminate the cost of the special form used to print the state-
ments, as well as the cost of stuffing them in envelopes and mailing them. Though
it is possible that the collections staff may complain that this collection tool is
being taken away from them, it is at best a poor method for bringing in errant
accounts receivable, and does little to reduce the workload of the collections per-
sonnel. Thus, eliminating the periodic issuance of statements to customers is an
easy way to shift the accounting staff away from a nonvalue-added activity,
which gives them time to pursue other more meaningful activities.

4-13 OFFER CUSTOMERS SECURE INTERNET
PAYMENT OPTIONS

Many prospective customers are not interested in shopping at a company’s Inter-
net store, because they are concerned that their credit card information will either
be intercepted at the point when they transmit it to the store, or that it will be kept
on file by the company, where it may be illegally accessed at any time in the
future. As long as credit cards are viewed as the primary form of payment on the


4-14 Reduce Number of Parts in Multipart Invoices 81

Internet, these shoppers will find other channels for buying products and services.
However, a company called [Pin has arrived at an alternative way to process pay-
ments that may attract these additional shoppers.

A company that wants to offer its customers the alternative of being able to
pay without the transmission of credit card information can use [Pin’s service.
This service, which is located at www.ipin.com, allows customers to store their
credit card information in a highly secure environment at that Web site in exchange
for an IPin identification number, which they can use as a form of payment at
selected Web sites (which must set up operating agreements with [Pin to use its
software to process customer transactions). This approach has the advantage of
keeping customer-specific credit card information off the Internet. Also, for those
customers who are truly paranoid about leaving their credit card information in
the hands of anyone, including [Pin, it also offers the option of linking customer
payments through their [Pin identification numbers to the billing statements of
selected Internet service providers or to the monthly invoices of a customer’s
phone company or wireless phone company.

This last option also yields the unique benefit of allowing a company to
charge its customers for micro-purchases (those purchases of just a few cents),
which can be summarized and billed directly to customers. This avoids the use of
credit cards, which charge minimum fees (usually 20 cents) for purchases, while
also allowing companies access to a new form of revenue—perhaps fees for access
to small amounts of data that were previously given away for free.

4-14 REDUCE NUMBER OF PARTS IN
MULTIPART INVOICES WV Author’s Choice

Some invoices have the thickness of a small magazine when they are printed
because they have so many parts. The top copy (or even the top two copies) usually
goes to the customer, while another one goes into a file that is sorted alphabeti-
cally; another goes into a file for invoices that is sorted by invoice number, and
yet another copy may go to a different department, such as customer service, so
that they will have an additional copy on hand in case a customer calls with a
question. This plethora of invoice copies causes several problems. One is that
the printer is much more likely to jam if the number of invoice copies running
through it is too thick. Another much more serious problem is that each of those
copies must be filed away. The alphabetical copy is probably a necessary one,
since all of the shipping documentation is attached to it, but there is no excuse
for filing invoices in numerical order; they can be found just as easily by calling
them up in the computer. A final problem is that multipart forms are more
expensive.


82 Billing Best Practices

The best practice that avoids this problem is to reduce the number of invoice
copies. Only one copy should go to the customer, and one copy should be
retained. That is two copies, not the four or five that some companies use. By
reducing the number of copies, there is much less chance that the printer will jam,
and the cost of the invoices can be substantially reduced. The biggest cost saving,
however, is of the filing time that has been eliminated, which can be many hours
per month, depending on the volume of invoices that are created periodically.

The biggest objection to reducing the number of invoice copies is from those
parts of the company that are accustomed to using the extra invoice copies. This
group is rarely the accounting department, which must do the work of filing the
extra copies, but rather other departments that have an occasional need to look at
them. The best way to overcome these objections is to educate the dissenters in
advance regarding the required filing time needed to keep extra copies, so they
understand that the cost of additional filing does not match the benefit of their
occasional need for the invoices. Another option is to give these people read-only
access to invoices in the accounting computer system, so that they can call up
invoice information on their computers, rather than looking for it manually in an
invoice binder. The combination of these two approaches usually eliminates any
opposition to reducing the number of invoice copies, allowing the accounting
staff to achieve extra efficiencies with this best practice.

4-15 REPLACE INTERCOMPANY INVOICING WITH
OPERATING TRANSACTIONS

Those companies with subsidiaries will find some difficulty at the end of the fis-
cal year, because they must back out all sales between subsidiaries, which are
not, according to accounting rules, true sales. The most common way to record
product shipments between locations is to issue an invoice to another subsidiary,
which pays it as though it is from an independently owned organization. At the
end of the year, the accounting staff must then determine the margin on all sales
to subsidiaries (which can be a lengthy undertaking) and create a journal entry to
reverse out the margin. This is clearly not a value-added activity, and reducing it
to the minimum gives the accounting staff more time to deal with other, more
productive issues.

A best practice that multiple-subsidiary companies can use is to avoid using
invoices when shipping between company-owned facilities. Instead, there are two
ways to record the transactions. The first and easiest approach is to record any
inventory transfers as a simple movement of inventory between warehouse loca-
tions in the computer system. This approach is only possible if a company uses a
single enterprisewide database of information to control activities in all company
locations. If such a system is in place, a shipping clerk can simply record a delivery

as being moved from one warehouse to another, or as being in transit to another
warehouse, where it will be recorded as having been received as soon as it arrives
at that location. The other possibility is to accumulate all material transfers in a
log and create a journal entry at the end of each reporting period (or sooner, such
as daily) to record inventory as having been shifted to a different company loca-
tion. This second approach requires more manual labor and is more subject to
error than the first approach, but can be used even if there is no enterprisewide
computer system for all locations. In either case, there is no need to create an
invoice, nor does the accounting staff have to worry about backing out the profit
on sales to company subsidiaries.

Cost: SS Installation time:

4-16 USE AUTOMATED BANK ACCOUNT DEDUCTIONS

In some industries, the invoices sent to customers are exactly the same every
month. This is common in service industries, where there are standard contracts
that provide the same services for the same price, and do so for long periods of
time. Examples of such cases are parking lots or health clubs, both of which put
their customers on long-term contracts to pay fixed monthly amounts. In these
cases, a company issues invoices for the same amount every month to all of its
customers. The customers then pay the same amount every month and the
accounts receivable staff enters the same amounts into the accounting software as
having been received.

When the same amount is due every month, a company can use automatic
deductions from the bank accounts of customers. This approach eliminates the
need to run any invoices, since the customers do not need them to make a pay-
ment. There are also no collection problems, since everything is automatic. Thus,
this approach can completely eliminate the invoicing and collection steps from
the accounting department.

Before implementing automatic deductions, one must first review the obsta-
cles that stand in the way of a successful project. One issue is that some invoices
will still be needed if a company elects to “‘grandfather” its existing customers,
so that they do not have to pay through bank deductions. Another problem is that
invoices are also required for the first month or two of business with a new cus-
tomer, because it usually takes some time before the automatic deduction is set
up and operating smoothly. A regular invoice may also be necessary for a new
customer because the first month of service may be for only part of the month
(e.g., if the customer starts at the middle of the month, rather than at the begin-
ning), which is easier to bill through an invoice than a deduction. Another issue is
if the customer’s bank account is canceled. Though these appear to be a signifi-
cant number of issues, they are still a small minority of the total number of trans-
actions processed. Generally speaking, if a company has a large base of cus-

tomers for whom there are consistent and identical billings, a very effective best
practice is to convert those customers to automatic bank deductions.

Cost: SS Installation time:

4-17 USE FINGERPRINT VERIFICATION FOR CREDIT CARD
AND CHECK PAYMENTS

Those businesses that accept a large amount of credit card or check payments
notice several problems with these methods of payment. First, it takes longer to
process a payment transaction, which can cause substantial queues of customers
who are waiting to pay. Also, credit card companies take a fee that is generally in
the range of 2 to 3 percent for each transaction processed. Further, a bounced
check can be charged back to the company, with all attendant costs. One can
avoid all of these problems through the use of a new fingerprint image reader that
is positioned next to an existing point-of-sale terminal.

This product, which is sold by Indivos, is a combination fingerprint scanner
and keypad. Customers must first be set up on the system, which requires them to
present two forms of identification, fill out a short form, have a fingerprint
scanned, and enter a seven-digit search code (which allows Indivos to later con-
duct more rapid searches through its database for the fingerprint image). They
can also enter a variety of payment methods at this time, such as their Master-
Card, Visa, American Express, or checking accounts. Then, when they decide to
make a purchase, they place a finger on the scanner and select a payment method
on the terminal. Once the system verifies their scan, the payment is processed
through the usual financial networks in the same manner as a regular credit card
or check payment.

Customers like the system because there is no risk of having their financial
information stolen, they no longer have to carry credit cards or checks with them,
and they can pay for items faster than with more traditional payment systems.
Also, once they are set up in the system, they can use this payment method in any
business that carries the same scanning terminals. The benefits for businesses
include a reduction in fraud costs, faster customer checkouts, and reduced service
fees. The reduction in service fees is a substantial issue to consider; since cus-
tomers can select immediate payment withdrawals directly from their checking
accounts through this method, companies can give them incentives to do so,
thereby substituting a few cents charge for an ACH transaction for a 2 to 3 per-
cent credit card fee. Over a large number of transactions, this savings can be sub-
stantial. Also, if one credit card company’s fee is substantially lower than that of
other companies, a business can offer a discount or other incentive to shoppers
who use the Indivos system to select from a range of payment choices.

Summary 85

TOTAL IMPACT OF BEST PRACTICES
ON THE BILLINGS FUNCTION

This section describes a set of best practices that, when integrated into the
billings function, results in significant efficiency improvements. The best prac-
tices presented here are a subset of the complete list presented earlier in this
chapter, in Exhibit 4.1. This listing, as diagrammed in Exhibit 4.3, eliminates
several best practices that are mutually exclusive. For example, if a company
uses a computerized shipping log to create invoices, there is no need to use
another best practice, such as tracking variances between invoices created and
the paper-based shipping log. When these types of conflicts arise, only the most
advanced best practice is assumed to be used. As a result, the best practices
shown in Exhibit 4.3 note that a company should always directly link its ship-
ping dock with the accounting database by having all shipments automatically
invoiced as soon as the shipping staff puts a delivery on an outbound truck. The
printed invoice should use a minimum number of copies, avoiding several
downstream steps to file them. The invoicing function should also avoid the use
of month-end statements. Finally, a company has a variety of invoice-delivery
options to choose from, ranging from EDI transmissions to point-of-delivery
invoicing, or even the complete elimination of invoices by using direct cash
withdrawals from customer bank accounts. The exact invoicing method or com-
bination of methods chosen will depend upon the special circumstances and
requirements of each company.

If some of the best practices noted in Exhibit 4.3 cannot be completed for
any reason, some lesser combination of best practices will still result in efficiency
improvements, though not to as great a degree as would be possible if the entire
set of improvements were implemented.

SUMMARY

This chapter focused on improving the speed and accuracy of invoice prepara-
tion and delivery. There are several ways to achieve these goals. One is to
increase the accuracy of invoicing information reaching the accounting depart-
ment, which calls for changes in the shipping department, as well as the
method for transferring shipping information to the accounting department.

Another set of methods involve how invoices are transmitted to customers.
New technologies allow one to do so electronically or at the point of delivery,
so that customers receive more accurate invoices more quickly than ever
before. Finally, invoices can be completely eliminated in a limited number of
cases, resulting in direct cash transfers from customer bank accounts to the
company. When used together, these best practices result in a significant
improvement in the efficiency of the billing function.

Budgeting Best Practices

Many companies find the budgeting process to be an excruciatingly slow and
painful process, requiring many months of continual effort before a reasonable
budget document is completed. Once it is done, they wonder why the company
went to all the effort, since no one makes a strong effort to follow it. This chapter
addresses both problems. There are a variety of best practices that focus on creat-
ing and implementing a budget model, ranging from defining capacity levels and
step-costing points to using activity-based budgeting. These are designed not
only to make the budgeting process simpler, but also to result in a better budget
that closely reflects management’s expectations regarding operations in the
upcoming budget period. In addition, there are several best practices that can
improve a company’s usage of the budget, so that it is closely integrated into
daily operations.

This chapter begins with an overview of implementation issues for all of the
best practices, followed by a discussion of individual best practices, each one
being presented in a separate section. The chapter finishes with a review of how
these best practices will change a company’s budgeting operations.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES FOR BUDGETING BEST PRACTICES

With few exceptions, improvements to the budgeting system are easy to implement
and can be done rapidly, with a minimum of fuss. The cost and duration are noted
in Exhibit 5.1. The reason is that most changes are to the budgeting model and pro-
cedures, neither of which are under the control of anyone but the accounting depart-
ment, and neither of which need, unlike humans, some explanation and cooperation.
Accordingly, one can assume a rapid implementation process that can mostly be
completed during the current budget cycle, resulting in immediate and rapid
improvement in the entire process.

There are only three best practices requiring a considerable amount of imple-
mentation effort. One is linking the budget to the purchase order system, since this
usually requires some custom programming. The second is switching to an activity-
based budget model, since this approach requires a complete revamping of the budget
model, as well as a new chart of accounts to reflect the changes. The third is the
installation of budgeting and planning software, which is particularly difficult for
multilocation companies. Also, on-line budget updating and video conferencing

case) and video conferencing equipment (in the later case). With these exceptions,
one can expect best practice implementations in this area to be an easy chore,
resulting in quick improvements.

5-1 CLEARLY DEFINE ALL ASSUMPTIONS

When the budget model is first presented to senior management, the person doing
the presenting is deluged with questions about what assumptions are used in the
model. Examples of assumptions that can cause problems are tax rate percentages,
sales growth rates (especially by product line, since some of those lines may be
exceedingly mature), capacity levels (see the next section), cost-of-goods-sold
margins, commission rates, and medical insurance rates per person. Upper manage-
ment wants to make sure that all assumptions are reasonable before they spend a
great deal of their time reviewing the presented information. If there are specious
assumptions, they will probably kick the budget back and demand changes
before they will agree to look at it.

The best way around this problem is to list all key assumptions either right at
the top of the budget model or else in clearly noted spots on each page. It is also
helpful to note how these assumptions have changed from previous years, either
by providing this information in a commentary or by showing prior year informa-
tion in an extra column in the budget. By providing this information as clearly as
possible, there will be fewer questions for the budgeting team to answer.

An even better approach is to tie as many of these assumptions into the budget
model as possible, so that a change to an assumption will result in an immediate
ripple effect through the budget. For example, changing a tax rate assumption will
immediately alter the tax expense in the budget, while altering the medical expense
per person will have a similar impact on personnel costs. Linking assumptions to
the budget allows one to make nearly instantaneous changes to a budget with
minimal effort.

When creating a budget that contains major increases in revenues, a common
problem is failing to reflect this change in the rest of the budget, resulting in an
inadequate amount of manpower, machinery, or facilities to handle the added
growth. For example, a planned increase in revenue requires a corresponding
increase in the number of sales staff who are responsible for bringing in the sales,
not to mention a time lag before the new sales personnel can be reasonably
expected to acquire new sales. Similarly, new sales at a production facility may

result in machine utilization levels that are too high to maintain—has anyone
thought of adding machinery purchases to the budget? This problem can be
turned around and dealt with from the point of view of planned expense reduc-
tions, too—if the percentage of direct labor is budgeted to decline due to the use
of automation, has anyone included the cost of the automation in the budget, and
has a suitable time lag been built into the plan to account for the ramp-up time
needed to implement the automation? Some of these problems are present in all
but the best budget models.

The best practice that resolves this issue is the definition of capacity levels in
the budget model. This can take the form of a table in the budget, such as the one
shown in Exhibit 5.2. This example notes the capacity levels for manpower, such
as a specific number of shipments per warehouse worker, sales per salesperson,
and new product releases per engineer. It is very important to list these capacity
levels for previous years in the same table, providing a frame of reference that
tells the reader if the assumed capacity levels in this year’s budget are attainable.
It may also be possible to include another comparison column in the table that
shows the capacity levels of competitors or of best practice companies, against
which the company has benchmarked its activities. By using this informational
layout, one can easily tell if more or less resources are needed to attain the rev-
enue and expense goals in a budget.

5-3 ESTABLISH PROJECT RANKING CRITERIA

When it comes time for the annual budget process, the accounting staff is usually
inundated with a flood of requests for funding capital projects. These are some-
times pet projects, others are for repairs or replacements, and still others are
entirely new business propositions. The trouble is that a great deal of time is
spent in sorting through them all to see which ones are viable. Further, after the

remaining ones are put in the budget, capital constraints typically lead to some of
them being thrown back out. As a result, capital projects can be a bottleneck dur-
ing the formation of the budget.

The best practice that reduces this bottleneck is to establish project ranking
criteria in advance and distribute this information to anyone who may be submit-
ting a capital request. These criteria should itemize how funds will be allocated.
For example, any project with a return on capital that exceeds a target level is a
top priority; next in line may be any project needed to bring a company in line
with government regulations, and so on. Once they see the criteria, budget partic-
ipants may voluntarily eliminate some of their own requests. In addition, if the
capital expenditure request form accompanies the ranking criteria, applicants can
fill out all the information the accounting staff needs to sort through the various
projects, making the accountant’s jobs much easier. This method not only elimi-
nates some of the least probable capital projects up front, but also does a better
job of categorizing those that are left.

5-4 ESTABLISH THE UPPER LIMIT OF AVAILABLE FUNDING

Too many budgeting processes take an inordinate amount of time to complete
because management goes through too many iterations while deciding on how
much money it has to spend. For example, the initial budget model may include
funding for a new facility, an acquisition, or a distribution to stockholders. How-
ever, once management determines that the amount of available funding is not
sufficient, they must recast the budget in order to arrive at a much smaller total
expenditure. This plays havoc with the accounting staff, who must coordinate all
the budgeting changes, modify the model, and reissue it.

The answer to this issue is to determine the amount of available funding as
early in the process as possible. For example, the amount of fixed assets, inven-
tory, and accounts receivable currently on hand can be extrapolated into the
next year to determine the total amount of borrowing base that is likely to be
available for borrowing purposes. Also, one can inquire of senior management
if there is any likelihood of making a public offering of shares or of making a
bond placement in the near future; this option is most unlikely for smaller com-
panies, while larger ones may be constrained by established policies regarding
the suitable debt-to-equity ratio that management is not allowed to exceed.
Finally, the company may spin off cash from continuing operations; a review of
current margin levels and cash flows can be used to determine the level of
funds originating from this source. When all of these sources are put together,
management usually finds that there is far less money available than they had
wished for, which keeps them from developing overblown budgets that cannot
possibly succeed.


92 Budgeting Best Practices

The only issue with this approach is that some managers like to produce bud-
gets that represent flights of fancy and do not appreciate having the extra infor-
mation regarding funding, since it brings them back to reality rather abruptly.
When these unique personalities are in management, it is best to use a great deal
of tact when presenting funding information. A good variation that works in this
situation is to present a range of funding amounts, along with the percentage
chance of having each amount available, plus the likely interest rate that the com-
pany will have to pay in order to obtain the funds. By showing a probable interest
rate, management will then understand that extra tiers of funding will only be
available at a greater cost, since the company’s credit risk rises as it borrows more
money. This form of presentation is an effective way to increase management’s
understanding of funding availability.

5-5 IDENTIFY STEP-COSTING CHANGE POINTS V Author’s Choice

A typical problem for anyone constructing a budget is to determine when step-
costing points occur. A step-cost is a block of additional expenses that must be
added when a certain level of activity is reached. For example, machinery can only
operate at a reasonable capacity level, perhaps 75 percent, before another machine
must be added to cope with more work, even if that workload will only fill the
machine at a very low level of capacity. The same principle applies to adding per-
sonnel or building space. In all cases, there is a considerable added expense that
must be incurred in one large block. If the expense is sufficiently large, it can play
havoc with the total level of expenses. Or, in the case of a really large capital pur-
chase, it may leave no room for other capital purchases for the next year. Accord-
ingly, it is necessary to keep close track of step-cost change points.

The best way to determine when an increase in step-costs will occur is to
create a table of activity measures that directly relates to each step-cost. For
example, a new shipping person is needed for every 135 pallets of product
shipped per day. By relating sales for the next year to the number of pallet loads
of shipments, one can reasonably predict when an additional shipper is needed.
Similarly, if a piece of production machinery will support $1 million of sales, it is
an easy matter to extrapolate this relationship based on expected sales to deter-
mine when additional machine purchases must be made. However, keep in mind
that step-costs can be delayed by using new work methods, which can alter these
relationships. For example, an automated shrink-wrapping machine can substan-
tially increase the number of pallets that a single shipper can handle in a day,
while a good preventive maintenance routine can reduce the amount of machine
downtime, thereby increasing utilization rates and delaying the need for more
production equipment. When these changes are added to the budget, it becomes
necessary to change the relationship between the activity levels and step-costs,

possibly with the relationships varying over the course of the budgeted period, as
more work methods are implemented.

Thus, identifying step-costing change points is necessary to understand
when new costs will be added to a budget, but one must also account for alter-
ations in the relationship between the underlying activity measures that cause the
step-costs to occur.

5-6 BUDGET BY GROUPS OF STAFF POSITIONS WV Author’s Choice

The payroll portion of the budget model can be an excessively long one because
every person in the company is listed on it. In particular, many accountants have
difficulty avoiding a complete listing of all people who are not categorized as
direct labor. As a result, this portion of the budget becomes an unwieldy cluster of
information, requiring a long time to read, as well as a considerable amount of
updating work to keep track of everyone’s pay levels.

A simple best practice is to summarize these positions by title, ensuring that
there are far fewer line items, so the budget becomes much easier to update and
review. To do so, one must summarize the pay levels of everyone with the same job
title and post the average pay rate in the model. For those people who object that
they can no longer determine who is summarized into which category, one can
either issue a separate list that identifies the title of each person in the company or
else insert the initials of all the people with each job title next to the summary-level
description in the budget (a difficult proposition when there are many people with
the same title!). The only real problem is in those companies where there is no
record of the job titles of employees. In this case, it may be sufficient to summarize
all payroll for each department into a single line item in the budget, with an average
pay rate for the entire group; this approach completely avoids the problem of deter-
mining pay by title. Any of these variations will result in a simplified payroll sec-
tion of the budget, while still retaining a high degree of accuracy.

5-7 CREATE A SUMMARIZED BUDGET MODEL FOR USE
BY UPPER MANAGEMENT

The full budget model used by the accounting staff is a large one, with separate
pages for the balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, capital expenditures,
and each department, not to mention additional subsets of this information for
each subsidiary. The full budget for a small company should run about 20 pages,
while one for a multilocation corporation can easily run into the hundreds of


94 Budgeting Best Practices

pages. This presents a problem for senior management when it wants to conduct
“what if” analysis work with the budget. For example, the president of the com-
pany may want to know what would happen to profits if there were | percent less
direct labor, or if materials costs changed due to an increase in inflation. Given
the size of the model, a senior manager’s only way to get this information is to
request that a budget analyst access the budget model, make the changes, and
send the results back. This can take days for one request to be completed, which
is a problem when the manager may want to model dozens of changes. Waiting
for the results of all possible variations on the manager’s requests may require
months. During the budget period, there is not enough time to process all of these
modeling requests, which leads to delays in completing the budget and frustra-
tion on the part of senior management.

The best practice that eliminates this problem is to create a small, summa-
rized version of the full budget model for use by the senior management team. By
doing so, these managers can play with all possible ‘“‘what if” variations on the
budget on their own computers, without waiting for someone in the accounting
department to process these changes for them, saving a very large amount of
time. To create such a budget model, it is extremely important to interview senior
managers to see what kinds of variables they will want to alter. These will not
vary much from year to year, unless there are drastic changes in the business, so
once the variables are identified, they can be listed in the front of the model for
easy access by the managers. For example, the variables can include the direct
labor and materials percentages, the inflation rate, average pay raise, average
employee benefit percentage, seasonality percentage for revenues, changes in
revenues, and the tax and interest rates. The remainder of the budget should be
shrunken down to the point where there is only a single expense line item for
each department and the smallest possible number of revenue line items. The
goal should be to keep the summarized budget model down to just a couple of
pages. Also, to keep the data in this model fresh, one can either give it a direct
computer link to the main budget model, automatically extracting the most cur-
rent data from the real budget, or else manually extract the information and
retype it into the manager’s budget model (which is a much easier proposition,
and avoids any special programming). Creating this model may take a few extra
weeks, but will be greatly appreciated by senior management.

The only problem with this budget model is that senior managers may not
know how to use it or the computer on which it runs. If so, training is necessary,
which may be difficult to fit into a manager’s busy daily schedule. A good alter-
native is to train each manager’s executive assistant, who can process any
changes to the budget model that the manager wishes to make.

5-8 INCLUDE A WORKING CAPITAL ANALYSIS

All too many companies have found that their budgets are entirely unworkable
because they have not accounted for the added cash required for working capital.
This is a particular problem for those organizations forecasting extremely high
rates of growth. They do not realize that they must have funds in advance to pay
for the staff and materials required to produce products, as well as to fund the
considerable increases in accounts receivable that will occur. Because of this, a
company finds that its sales take off, as per the budget, while cash reserves
rapidly dry up, resulting in a cash-starved organization that must scramble to find
more cash to keep it growing. More times than not, a promising start is ham-
strung because of lack of anticipation of working capital needs.

Clearly, the budget must account for working capital. There should be an
extra page devoted to it in the budget, or it can be included in the cash flow page.
In either case, the budget should make an assumption regarding the amount of
inventory, accounts payable, and accounts receivable that will occur as sales go
up; for example, there may be inventory turns of 12 per year, accounts receivable
turns of 9, and accounts payable turns of 10. These turnover figures must then be
built into the working capital formulas to determine how much extra cash will be
needed as sales increase. An alternative approach is to assume that all working
capital changes will be cleared in one month; for example, accounts payable will
be paid in precisely one month, and accounts receivable paid by customers in the
same period. This simpler approach is the one most commonly found in budgets,
though it is not quite as accurate as the first method. The importance of accurate
working capital forecasting cannot be overstated, especially for a cash-strapped
company.

5-9 LINK TO PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS AND REWARDS

A continuing frustration for senior managers is to see an immense amount of
time being put into the formation of the annual budget, only to have employees
completely ignore it over the ensuring year. Some wonder why they bother with
the budget at all. A common result is little or no management support for the
annual budgeting process.

The best practice that resolves this problem is to tightly link the budget and
employee reward systems. By doing so, employees are forced to peruse the budget
continually to ensure that their actual performance matches the standard laid down
by senior management at the start of the year—if not, then their next pay raise
and bonus may not arrive, or be much smaller than expected. At worst, they may
find themselves looking for employment elsewhere. To make this best practice
work, the human resources staff should be brought in at the end of the budgeting


96 Budgeting Best Practices

process to devise a set of reward mechanisms that directly link employee pay to
attaining the budget. For example, if a revenue budget requires sales of $1 million
per salesperson, there should be a hefty bonus for the sales staff associated with
attaining that goal. Similarly, if an automation project is scheduled for completion
in July, at a cost of $500,000 and an immediate reduction of 11 direct labor per-
sonnel, the engineering manager should be tied to a bonus that is paid out only if
all of these budgeted items are attained. This should be a very clear-cut document
that is an integral part of the budget, one that is reviewed by senior management for
reasonableness. Further, this linkage should be carefully reviewed with all con-
cerned managers several times during the year to ensure that there is no question
about how much they will be paid and the basis upon which all pay calculations
are based. This is an excellent management tool for ensuring that the budget will
be followed and attained.

The only problem with this best practice is when senior management puts
unrealistic expectations into the budget, such as assuming that sales can be dou-
bled without a corresponding increase in the sales staff. When this happens, man-
agers will ignore the budget once again, since they know in advance that there is
no conceivable way they can meet their assigned tasks. Setting attainable targets
is key to making this best practice work correctly.

When implementing this best practice, try to avoid the use of a hurdle bonus.
This bonus is earned only after the company achieves a specific milestone. For
example, a typical bonus package will begin to pay out when a company reaches
80 percent of its revenue or profit target and will stop paying out when 100 per-
cent of the target is reached. When this type of plan is used, participants tend to
“game the system,” using incorrect sales or accounting practices to exactly meet
their maximum bonus payout levels. A better approach is to use a linear compen-
sation plan that avoids any hurdle points, so employees will have no incentive to
game the system. This linear plan would begin to pay out bonuses at a very low
level of performance and continue to pay out at exactly the same proportion of
the target sales or profit levels, with no upper cap on the potential bonus. This
approach goes a long way toward the elimination of employee behavior that is
adverse to a company’s best interests while they pursue large bonuses.

5-10 USE ACTIVITY-BASED BUDGETING

For many organizations, the existing budgeting system simply does not yield ade-
quate results. Management can fiddle with the numbers all they want, but work-
ing within the existing structure of revenues by product line and expenses by
department is so rigid that there is little room for improving operating results.
Only by using outlandish assumptions, such as inordinate price increases or cost
reductions, can any reasonable profit improvement be attained. As the new bud-


5-11 Use Flex Budgeting 97

get year progresses and everyone realizes that those absurd assumptions are, in
fact, not attainable, some of the blame is put on the budgeting process, resulting
in a loss of credibility. This problem is especially common in old, established
industries, where competition is high and low profits are the norm.

Activity-based budgeting is the best solution for companies in this quandary.
To use it, the existing budget model must either be scrapped or used alongside a
new model, which pools all costs into cost centers, assigns these costs to activi-
ties, and charges the activities to products and customers. By using this new
approach, one can see much more clearly the products on which a company
really makes (or does not make) money, and margins on all customers, based on
the services they demand from the company. With this better information, man-
agement can target cost reductions in those areas where there is little return on
the money invested, while targeting expense increases if there is a corresponding
increase in margin. This is a very large topic that requires a separate book to fully
comprehend. For more information, read Driving Value Using Activity-Based
Budgeting, by James Brimson and John Antos (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1999).

The biggest problem with activity-based budgeting is that it requires an entirely
new budget model, as well as a new chart of accounts in which to store the budget
information. Both of these changes are significant and require months (and some-
times years) of careful planning and implementation. The reason for all the planning
is that all accounting information systems are designed to feed information into
the existing chart of accounts, so these systems must be modified to accumulate
data in the manner required for the activity-based budgeting system instead. One
way to get around this problem and activate the new system much more quickly
is to keep the old budgeting model and continue to account for it through the
chart of accounts in the traditional manner, manually maintaining the new bud-
geting model to one side and reporting on actual results with a separate system.
Though certainly more labor-intensive, this approach can be implemented at once
and requires very little change in the existing accounting systems.

5-11 USE FLEX BUDGETING

Perhaps the single most tedious part of updating a budget is altering the myriad
expense line items every time someone makes a change to the estimated revenue
level. Revenue is far and away the most commonly tweaked number in a budget,
so the underlying expenses have to be recast to be in proportion to the changed
revenue levels a multitude of times. This is a major chore not only for the
accounting staff maintaining the budget, but also for those managers who must be
contacted about changes to the expense levels they had previously authorized.

A recasting of the budget model will largely eliminate this problem. Instead
of making changes to the expense line item for every expense in the budget, it is


98 Budgeting Best Practices

much easier to set up each one as either a flexible expense account or one that is
fixed within a broad range of revenue levels. If it is fixed, there is no need for
change, unless there is an enormous alteration in budgeted revenue levels. How-
ever, many other expenses will vary directly with revenue; in these cases, it is
possible to revise the budget formulas so that they are listed as percentages of the
monthly revenue level. By making these formula alterations, it becomes an easy
matter to adjust revenue and see a swath of expense changes ripple through the
budget model—with no manual intervention whatsoever. This best practice can
reduce budget maintenance work to a fraction of the amount formerly needed.

Though the flex budget discussion has centered on tying expenses to specific
revenue levels, it is also possible, and probably more accurate, to tie some
expenses to other levels of activity. For example, telephone usage or office
expenses should be linked more properly to the number of budgeted employees,
while utility costs can be tied either to square footage used or the number of
machines in operation. Thus, one can link expenses to a number of activity mea-
sures in a flex budget.

5-12 AUTOMATICALLY LINK THE BUDGET TO
PURCHASE ORDERS

A budget is not of much use if it is not tightly linked to company operations. It is
common for a company to spend an inordinate amount of time constructing a fine
budget and then to struggle with how to force the company to live by it. When
this happens, the people who participated in creating the budget wonder why they
spent time on it and will certainly be less willing to do so in the future. In this
instance, the budget is seen as a mere formality.

To avoid the problem, one can link the budget to purchase orders. Under this
method, the budget is loaded into the purchasing database used by the purchasing
staff to create purchase orders. Whenever they enter a new purchase order into
the computer system, they must include the account number to which the expense
is charged; the system then compares the total year-to-date or period-to-date
expense for this item to the budgeted amount and either issues a warning for an
over-budget expenditure or rejects it. By using this best practice, one can be
assured of keeping expenditures within budgeted levels.

However, there are some issues to deal with when using this system. One is
that there may be necessary reasons for making an expenditure, such as an emer-
gency purchase of some kind that must be made in order to keep the facility run-
ning. In this case, it may be useful to allow a manager to override the system with
a special password. Also, some managers may be caught unawares toward the
end of the year—if they have spend an inordinate amount earlier in the year, they
will have no funding available at all for the last few weeks or months of the year.

In this situation, it is best to forewarn managers over the course of the year by
issuing a simple report, such as the one shown in Exhibit 5.3, that lists each
expense item, the year-to-date amount spent, the full-year budget, and the amount
left to spend. This information allows managers to know the exact amount avail-
able for their use and generally avoids this problem of people running out of
money at the end of the year.

5-13 ISSUE A BUDGET PROCEDURE
AND TIMETABLE WV Author’s Choice

The typical budget dies a lingering death. It is not issued on time, nor is the first
issuance likely to be the last one. Instead, there are a multitude of last-minute
changes that force the budget process to continue into the next year. As a result,
the budget may not be usable as a basis of comparison for new year results for
several months.

The best solution to this problem is to issue a tightly structured budget pro-
cedure to the organization, along with an accompanying timetable, that specifies
when all activities will occur, who will complete them, and when a deliverable is
due back at the budget manager’s office. By laying out the process in this manner
and following up closely on all due dates, it is possible to issue a complete budget
on time, every time. A good budget procedure should include the following steps,
at a minimum:

¢ Benchmarking comparison. Though rarely used in a budget, it is extremely
useful to conduct a benchmarking comparison of corporate performance


100 Budgeting Best Practices

against those of “best in class” companies, and to provide this information
with the budget packages that go out to all departments, so that they can set
expectations for improvements in their areas. This task can be completed
well in advance of the regular budget process.

¢ Revenue budget. The first part of the budget process is always a determina-
tion by the sales staff of what they think they can sell in the upcoming year.
Without this information, the remainder of the budget is impossible to con-
struct. This portion must be completed and returned before any other steps
can be completed.

¢ Materials budget. The purchasing department uses the revenue budget to
determine its purchasing volumes, which is necessary for forecasting materials
costs based on purchase volumes.

¢ Automation budget. The industrial engineering staff must determine what
automation it plans to add to the production floor in order to eliminate direct
labor and improve efficiencies. The timing of when these changes will be
completed has a major impact on when to budget changes in labor and effi-
ciencies into the forthcoming budget.

¢ Personnel budget. There must be a separate budget that outlines all the staff
positions needed, their average pay rates, and the associated payroll burden.
This number will vary based on the revenue volumes that were previously
determined, not to mention any automation projects.

¢ Capital budget. The automation budget will feed into the capital budget,
since these projects usually require a considerable amount of funding. There
may be other capital projects that do not run through the engineering depart-
ment, such as for office equipment, so this budget is not normally completed
until all departments have submitted their budgets.

¢ Departmental budget. Each department must note its expected expenditures,
as well as personnel requirements.

* Cash flow budget. After all the previous budgets are returned, the accounting
staff loads them into the budget model, which determines any resulting profits
or losses, working capital changes, and capital requirements, all of which
feed into the cash flow budget.

¢ Funding and investments budget. The cash flow budget feeds into the funding
and investments budget. This one is used by the chief financial officer, who
determines either the sources and cost of funds (if cash is needed) or where
it is to be invested and the expected returns from doing so (if there will be
a cash surplus). The results of this budget will also feed back into the inter-
est expense and investment income line items elsewhere in the budget.

¢ Employee performance budget. Finally, after the budget is completed, the
human resources manager uses it to create an employee performance budget
that links pay levels and bonus payments to the performance levels noted

elsewhere in the budget, such as completing automation projects or attaining
budgeted sales levels.

Also, some companies may want to include an acquisitions budget, which is
closely linked to the funding and investments budget, since this activity will have
a major impact on cash flows.

The preceding list of budget modules makes it obvious that the budget
process flows in a very specific sequence, with one part of the budget being used
as a basis for the next part. The budget procedure and timetable must be built
around this budget flow; specific dates of completion for one piece of the budget
tie into the start date of the next part of the budget that requires information from
the first part. It is wise to include a buffer of a few days between the completion
date of one part and the start of the next, so that inevitable completion troubles
can still be ironed out, leaving sufficient time to complete the overall budget by
the targeted date. Do not be surprised if the timetable is not accurate in the first
year it is used, since it is difficult to estimate completion times. Just be sure to
note actual completion dates in the first year and adjust the timetable accordingly
in the following year. Only by constant adjustment over a long period of time will
the budget procedure and timetable become fine-tuned tools for the efficient and
orderly completion of the budget.

5-14 PURCHASE BUDGETING AND PLANNING SOFTWARE

The vast majority of businesses create and maintain their budgets using an elec-
tronic spreadsheet such as Excel. Though this approach works fine for small
organizations, it is quite unwieldy for large ones. The trouble is that individual
departments create their own budget models using formats that vary from the one
used by the budgeting department. When the budgeting staff receives these mod-
els from the various departments, they must manually reinput the information
into a master spreadsheet, which is quite labor-intensive. Also, when any signifi-
cant variable is added to the model, all related formulas must be manually altered
and then tested to ensure that the model still operates properly. Further, it is diffi-
cult to track which department has submitted budget information or when it made
its last update. For these reasons, larger companies have considerable difficulty
using spreadsheets as the basis for a budgeting system.

The solution is to purchase budgeting and planning (B&P) software. This soft-
ware maintains a central database of budgeting information that is automatically
updated when users enter information. They can enter information in a variety of
ways—via dial-up modem, through a local or wide area network, or the Internet
(depending on what software is purchased). The software can also be maintained
off-site by an application service provider (ASP). In addition, the software gener-


102 Budgeting Best Practices

ates templates for data-entry use by each department, as well as issuing all pro
forma financial reports at the press of a button. The better systems also have
workflow management capabilities that reveal who has not yet submitted a
budget. Variance analysis tools also issue warnings to the budgeting staff when
submitted budgeting information exceeds predetermined levels or when other
preset rules are violated. Some systems are also designed with links to customer
relationship management (CRM) systems, so that real-time sales information can
be shifted into the budget model for additional analysis. A variety of other capa-
bilities are available, such as automatically calculating line-of-credit projections,
designing “what if” scenarios, determining inventory requirements based on

Examples of the companies that produce B&P software are Cognos, Hyperion
Software, Comshare, and Adaytum Software. Most of the enterprise resources plan-
ning (ERP) systems already include a B&P module. These are complex software
systems that require customized installation, so one should expect to pay more than
$100,000 for the larger systems. A pay-as-you-go ASP solution will be significantly
less expensive in the short term, and may be a better solution if a company wants to
see how the system works before investing in an in-house installation.

5-15 REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS

Some budget models are astoundingly complex because there are so many
account line items in which to record budgeting information. This is nearly
always the fault of the controller, who has allowed the chart of accounts to grow
to an excessive degree. Once there are too many accounts in the general ledger, it
becomes obligatory to budget for the contents of each one. This presents the dual
problems of adding new lines to the budget every year, and of forcing managers
to do extra analysis to determine the budgeted amounts for the upcoming year.
The simple, though long-term, approach is to eliminate as many accounts as
possible from the chart of accounts. This takes a long time, since one must be care-
ful to shift account balances to surviving accounts, verify that inactivated accounts
are not used for some special purpose, and confirm that there will be no impact on
the resulting financial reports. Given the intricacies of eliminating accounts, it is
usually best to do so in small groups of just a few per month, with an overall reduc-
tion in the number of accounts taking as long as a year to complete. Once this is
done, it is a simple matter to eliminate the same accounts from the budget.
Another approach that is not only quicker, but also bypasses the need for a
lengthy reduction in the chart of accounts, is to eliminate the accounts in the budget
model, but to keep them in the actual chart of accounts. This option will result in
no budget in the upcoming budget period for those accounts that have been
excluded from the budget model, so it is only useful for those accounts with very

small balances. Thus, this is only good for a few accounts and is not as definitive
a solution as eliminating accounts from the chart of accounts for good.

5-16 REVISE BUDGETS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS

Most organizations create new budgets just once a year. By doing so, they make
estimates of sales volume for a number of months into the future that are
extremely difficult to meet, and then build a “house of cards” of projected
expenses and capital purchases that are justified by these weak sales numbers.
Because of the difficulty of estimating these sales, managers tend to err on the
conservative side, estimating revenues that are too low. Furthermore, when the
budget year has been completed, the management team tends to waste time argu-
ing about why actual performance did not meet the expectations set within the
budget. Finally, any unexpected changes in the business during the year, such as
an acquisition or the elimination of a product, will not be included in the budget,
so all budget-versus-actual analyses will be off by the amount of these changes,
rendering the analyses worthless.

One can incrementally revise budgets on a quarterly or even a monthly basis
in order to avoid these problems. By doing so, all key revenue and related
expense or capital decisions can be revised to reflect short-term changes in the
business, making the budget a much more relevant document.

The difficulty with this best practice is the greatly increased number of
required budgeting iterations. Since this is generally considered to be a difficult
process to complete just once a year, imagine the consternation of management if
the process is done again every three months! To reduce the pain of this process,
one should consider shifting away from the use of electronic spreadsheets for
budgeting calculations, instead using commercially sold budgeting packages that
allow for direct updating of budget information in the model over the Internet or
the company intranet, while also allowing for easy changes to the budget model
without the attendant calculation errors that are so common in an electronic
spreadsheet. By making this change, budgeting iterations are much easier to com-
plete, allowing for frequent budget revisions.

5-17 SIMPLIFY THE BUDGET MODEL

A company that has used the same budgeting model for many years will find that it
gradually becomes more complicated. This is because there are incremental changes
each year—a new analysis page here, extra departments there, perhaps some


104 Budgeting Best Practices

assumptions as well. Though the changes seem minimal if looked at for just one
year, the accumulation over many years makes the model very cumbersome, diffi-
cult to understand, and prone to error. For example, if formulas are added to the
budget that require inputting the final balance sheet numbers from the previous year,
it is possible that no one will remember this when the next budgeting cycle arrives in
the following year, especially if the person who made the change in the previous
year is no longer with the company, or if the change was not documented anywhere.
As the number of these changes pile up over the years, it becomes increasingly diffi-
cult to complete the budget on time. The person managing the budget model
becomes increasingly indispensable, for no one else knows how to use it.

To avoid these problems, it is necessary to regularly simplify the budget
model. This does not mean that the simplification can be done once and then
dropped. On the contrary, the standard budget procedure should begin with a
review of the model from the previous year to ensure that all budget line items and
calculations are thoroughly documented and understandable, and that they are still
needed. There should also be a step that specifically requires the budget manager
to review the need for extra line items and formulas, with an eye to eliminating as
much as possible from the budget model every year. Though it may not be possi-
ble to completely streamline the budget model in one year, a continuing effort in
this area will yield excellent results as long as the review is continual.

An added benefit of simplifying the budget model is that less budgetary
“gaming” arises. For example, when a large number of expense categories are
used, managers tend to resort to all kinds of expense juggling as the budget year
progresses in order to ensure that actual expenses incurred exactly match the
amounts budgeted. These games are a waste of corporate resources, since they
take management time away from the corporate mission. By summarizing many
revenue and expense line items into just a few budgetary line items, managers
will have the leeway to run the business in response to ongoing developments in
the marketplace, rather than in accordance with the dictates of the budget.

Though the main focus of this best practice is to reduce the complexity of the
budget model, it is sometimes sufficient to ensure that the model is adequately
documented. Some businesses really become more complex over time and there-
fore require more detailed budget models. This is particularly true of companies
on a fast growth track, especially if they are growing by acquisition and must
account for the operations of many new businesses. In these cases, the budget
manager should review the model at the end of each budget cycle to see what has
been added to the model this year, and verify that complete and thoroughly
understandable descriptions have been included in the budget procedure that note
the reasons for the changes, how they work, and the resulting impact on the entire
budget model. This step may be all that is needed for some companies.

5-18 Store Budget Information in a Central Database 105

5-18 STORE BUDGET INFORMATION IN A CENTRAL DATABASE

Too often, a budget manager assembles all of the information needed to create the
annual budget, has done so with days to spare, and yet somehow cannot release
the budget on time. The reason is that the budget pieces are just that—in pieces —
and cannot be easily put together, requiring a great deal of labor to rekey them all
into a central budget model. The information is especially difficult to assemble if
department heads have added new line items for new types of expenses, or
deleted or merged existing ones. When this happens, someone must contact the
department managers to request a clarification, sometimes resulting in last-
minute changes to the underlying budget model that may introduce errors into the
budget formulas, resulting in incorrect cost or revenue summarizations. When
there are many departments or subsidiaries, it is possible for all these issues to
add up to more time to assemble the data than it took for the rest of the company
to complete its part of the budget!

The solution to this problem is to centralize the budget into a single database.
Department managers are issued templates for the budget that are derivatives of
this database and they must fill in the blanks provided—no exceptions allowed.
When these budget forms are turned in to the budget manager, it is a simple mat-
ter to quickly peruse them and determine which revenue or expense line items
have been left blank and which additions have been made that do not fit into the
standard template; managers can be contacted at once and asked to revise their
budgets to fit the existing model. It may even be possible to give managers direct
access to the budget model through modems or the internal company computer
network (see the “Use On-Line Budget Updating” section, next), so that man-
agers are forced to enter information into the existing budget model. This
approach is a quick and easy way to greatly reduce the back-end work by the
accounting department to assemble incoming budget information.

The only problem with this best practice is that sometimes there will be new
company activities that cannot be easily shoehorned into the existing budget
model. This is an especially common circumstance when a company acquires
another corporation that operates in an entirely different industry. For example,
the expenses in a freight-hauling company will vary significantly from those of a
mail-order business. In these cases, the budget model obviously must be changed.
The best way to do so is to have the budget manager be informed of decisions by
senior management to acquire or start up businesses, so that the manager can
make changes to the budget model in advance, which eliminates the need for any
last-minute changes to the model.

106 Budgeting Best Practices

5-19 USE ON-LINE BUDGET UPDATING

One of the most difficult problems for a budget manager in a large company is
bringing together the budget information arriving from a multitude of outlying
company locations. For example, a location may send budget updates on paper or
a floppy disk, either of which requires the manual translation of this information
into the budget model by the budget manager’s staff. If there are many locations
reporting budget information, this can result in a flood of work for several days.
Also, the person reentering the budget information may make a typing error,
thereby altering a budgeted amount from what a subsidiary intended, or may mis-
construe the submitted data and list a budget number in the wrong account. In
either case, the budget must be reviewed by the subsidiary and a request made to
adjust the error, which takes still more time and effort.

An excellent best practice that entirely eliminates this problem is to give sub-
sidiaries direct access to the budget model via modems. They can then dial up the
budget model, enter it themselves, make any necessary changes, and review the
results. By doing so, all errors are made, and must be corrected, by the sub-
sidiaries, taking this chore away from the central accounting group.

There are two problems with this best practice. One is that all subsidiaries
must go through the effort of acquiring modems, as well as direct phone line
access to those modems, in order to acquire on-line access to the budget model.
However, in these days of universal Internet access, it is a rare company that does
not already have modem access. The second item is more critical: Anyone from
any subsidiary can now have access to the entire budget model, with the ability to
delete it, alter information for other parts of the company, or just observe the
numbers budgeted for other divisions or departments, which can be confidential.
To avoid this problem, it may be necessary to split the budget into different files,
one for each subsidiary, and then give password access only to the portion of the
budget assigned to each subsidiary. Another option is to keep the budget model in
one piece, but to restrict access by passwords to just those account codes that
apply to each subsidiary. The first option allows a company to use an electronic
spreadsheet to contain the model, but the latter approach requires that it be stored
in a database with better password protection than is typically available for an
electronic spreadsheet. A company can pick either option based on its overall
need for securing budget information.

5-20 USE VIDEO CONFERENCING FOR BUDGET UPDATING

Companies with many locations have the added budgeting cost of bringing together
managers from outlying locations, sometimes for a number of meetings. Given
the high price of travel and lodging, this can be a significant expense. Further, the


Total Impact of Best Practices on the Budgeting Function 107

activities in which those people are normally engaged will stop while they are
traveling to and from budget meetings, so there is an added degree of waste.

Technology can be used to eliminate these costs. The latest innovation is to
use video conferencing to hold meetings, thereby avoiding all travel costs and
only taking up people’s time for the duration of an actual meeting. The range of
options for a video conferencing system runs from a company-owned video pro-
duction room that has projection screens and television cameras down to a small
device that mounts on top of one’s computer, allowing for transmission of the
image of whomever is sitting in front of the computer. The larger and more com-
plex option is recommended for the budgeting chore, since it has the added fea-
tures of allowing for the video transmission of documents to other sites, much
better video quality, and the option to have simultaneous conferences with up to
two other locations.

The main problem with using a quality video conferencing system is that it
can cost $100,000 per location, though this cost is rapidly coming down. The
smallest video units only cost about $100, though the video quality is quite
poor. One must choose the system that fits a company’s ability to pay (which
may be high if there are other applications to which such a system can be put,
such as for the transmission of engineering meetings). It is also possible to rent
video conferencing centers, which may be considerably less expensive than
purchasing one. This is an especially good option if there are few other uses to
which a company-owned video conferencing center can be put. In addition,
there must be very tight scheduling of meetings, requiring everyone to be on-
line at the same time. Otherwise, some very expensive equipment will be tied
up while waiting for someone to arrive at his or her conferencing site. The
underlying problem is system cost, so a careful analysis of all expenses is nec-
essary before buying a video conferencing system.

TOTAL IMPACT OF BEST PRACTICES
ON THE BUDGETING FUNCTION

Most of the best practices discussed in this chapter are noted in Exhibit 5.4,
where they are clustered around the three main budgeting activities—creating the
budget model, implementing it, and using it. Most of the best practices impact the
creation of the budget model, either by increasing its simplicity or by improving
the information that goes into it. For example, reducing the number of accounts
and budgeting by groups of staff positions reduce the size of the model, while
using activity-based budgeting improves the resulting information. Other best
practices improve the ability of the company to quickly and effectively input data
into the budget model or to discuss changes to it, either through video conferenc-
ing, a budget procedure, or on-line budget updating. Finally, several methods are

available for closely linking the resulting budget model to company operations,
so that most activities cannot be completed without some interaction with budget
information. What all of these changes amount to is a highly efficient budgeting
process that can be completed in less time than the previous budgeting system,
while providing much better information to the management team.

SUMMARY

This chapter focused primarily on those best practices that improve a budget
model’s ease of use as well as the quality of the information it produces. These
are the very issues most managers complain about, since many budget models
take an eternity to produce and are not that accurate when released. Since the
bulk of the changes in this area are easy and inexpensive to implement, there is
no reason why an active and enterprising accounting manager cannot swiftly
replace the old budgeting system with one that is easy to use and results in excel-
lent budgeting information.

There was a lesser focus on best practices that enhance one’s use of the bud-
get once it has been produced. Since the budget is an excellent control tool, the
best of these practices is one that ties the budget directly to the purchase order
system, so that purchase orders can be automatically compared to the remaining
available budget and rejected by the computer if there are no budgeted funds
remaining. Another best practice links employee performance to the budget,
while another creates a summarized budget model for further financial modeling
work by members of management. These are effective ways to maximize the
budget once it has been produced.

Cash Management
Best Practices

This chapter covers the best practices that can be used to create a more efficient
cash management function. Though this area falls into the finance function at
many larger companies, it is typically under the authority of the controller in a
smaller company, and so is covered in this book.

The best practices in this chapter are primarily concerned with creating an
orderly flow of cash into and out of a company’s coffers, leaving no cash in the
system that is not being properly utilized to the fullest extent. This method frees
up the largest possible amount for investment purposes. The vast majority of
these best practices should be clustered together, since they are complementary,
working most effectively if they are all used at once.

This chapter begins with a discussion of the implementation problems asso-
ciated with each best practice and then moves on to cover the advantages and dis-
advantages of using each one. The final section discusses how to use most of
these best practices as a group to achieve a cash management system with a high
degree of efficiency.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES FOR CASH MANAGEMENT
BEST PRACTICES

All of the best practices covered in this chapter are noted in Exhibit 6.1, which
shows the cost and duration of each item. In nearly all cases, cash management
implementations are quite inexpensive and can be completed in a short time. The
reason for these easy setups is that there is no custom programming involved, and
no need to involve other departments. Without these two problem areas, it
becomes an easy matter to install a whole range of best practices in short order. To
make the situation even easier, a company’s bank is usually eager to help install
most of these items, because most of them involve creating close banking ties,
which keeps a company from realistically being able to move its banking busi-
ness elsewhere. A bank can also charge fees for many of these services, which
gives it an added incentive to help out. Thus, cash management is an area in
which a controller can enjoy great success in improving operations.

Though all of the best practices noted in Exhibit 6.1 are covered in some
detail later in this chapter, it is useful to see how the most important ones fit
together into a coherent set of cash management practices. Accordingly, there is a
flowchart in Exhibit 6.2 that shows how lockboxes and area-concentration bank-
ing can be used to accumulate cash from customers and forward it into a central
bank account, from which cash is distributed only as needed to a payroll zero-
balance account (for payments to employees) and a controlled disbursements
account (for payments to suppliers). By using this approach, cash can be quickly
sent to the main bank account and doled out only when company checks are
cashed, which allows the cash management staff to transfer all remaining funds
to an investment account where it can earn interest, rather than lying idle in any
number of corporate checking accounts.

6-1 ACCESS BANK ACCOUNT INFORMATION
ON THE INTERNET VW Author’s Choice

If the accounting staff needs to know the current balance outstanding on a loan,
savings, or checking account, the most common way to find out is to call the
company’s bank representative. This is a slow and sometimes inaccurate
approach, since the representative may not be available or will misread the infor-
mation appearing on the screen. More progressive companies have purchased
software from their banks that allows them to dial into the bank database to view
this information directly. While this is a reasonable approach, there is a cost asso-
ciated with the modem and software, and there is also a time delay while the
modem connects to the bank’s database. Also, much of this software is relatively
primitive and is character-based, rather than graphics-based.

An easier approach, and one that is rapidly supplanting the dial-up modem
method, is to provide bank customers with direct access to their account informa-


6-3 Collect Receivables through Lockboxes 113

tion through a Web site. This access is usually free, requires no special software
besides an Internet browser, and can be accessed at once, if the user is connected
to a direct-access Internet connection, such as a DSL, cable, or T1 phone line.
The better Web sites are also heavily engineered to be easy to read, with on-line,
automated help text to walk the user through the screens. This is becoming such a
powerful tool that users should consider switching their bank accounts to those
financial institutions that offer this service.

6-2 AVOID DELAYS IN CHECK POSTING

When there is a sudden influx of checks, the accounting staff may require an
extra day to post them all against the accounts receivable database. This delay
can also occur when the payments being made are slightly different from the
invoices that they are paying, which requires some delay while the differences are
reconciled. Though these problems can create a real bottleneck in the accounting
department, they also result in a lengthening of the time interval before the
checks are deposited at the bank, which in turn results in lost investment income.

To avoid this problem, the accounting staff can photocopy checks as they
arrive, so that postings can be done from the copies, rather than the original
checks. This allows the deposit to be made at once, rather than later. The main
problem with this approach is the danger that a check will not be copied or that
the copy will be lost, which results in a missing posting to the accounts receivable
database. This problem leads to downstream collections and research problems
involving backtracking to find the missing checks. This problem can be avoided
through proper reconciliation procedures that match the total number of copied
checks to the total number of actual checks, as well as the total amount posted to
the total amount on the copied checks.

6-3 COLLECT RECEIVABLES THROUGH
LOCKBOXES W Author’s Choice

There are a number of problems associated with receiving all customer payments
at a company location. For example, checks can be lost or delayed in the mailroom,
given to the wrong accounting person for further processing, or delayed in transit
from the company to the bank. It is also necessary for the mailroom staff to log in
all received checks, which are later compared to the deposit slip sent out by the
accounting staff to ensure that all received checks have been deposited —this is a
nonvalue-added step, though it is necessary to provide some control over received


114 Cash Management Best Practices

checks. All these steps are needed if checks are received and processed directly
by a company.

The answer is to have the bank receive the checks instead. To do so, a com-
pany’s bank sets up a lockbox, which is essentially a separate mailbox to which
deposits are sent by customers. The bank opens all mail arriving at the lockbox,
deposits all checks at once, copies the checks, and forwards all check copies and
anything else contained in customer remittances to the company. This approach
has the advantage of accelerating the flow of cash into a company’s bank account,
since the lockbox system typically reduces the mail float customers enjoy by at
least a day, while also eliminating all of the transaction-processing time that a
company would also need during its internal cash-processing steps. The system
can be enhanced further by creating lockboxes at a number of locations through-
out the country, with locations very close to a company’s largest customers. Cus-
tomers will then send their funds to the nearest lockbox, which further reduces
the mail float and increases the speed with which funds arrive in a company’s
coffers. If there are multiple lockboxes, a company should periodically compare
the locations of its lockboxes to those of its customers, to ensure that the con-
stantly changing mix of customers does not call for an alteration in the locations
of some lockboxes to bring the overall mail float-time down to the lowest possi-
ble level. In short, there are some exceptional advantages to using lockboxes.

There are only two problems with lockboxes, one involving fees and the
other being a one-time problem with implementation. A bank will charge both a
fixed and variable-rate fee for the use of a lockbox. There is a small, fixed
monthly fee for the lockbox, plus a charge of a few cents for every processed
check. For a company with a very small number of incoming checks, these costs
may make it uneconomical to maintain a lockbox. Also, the work required to con-
vince customers to change the company’s pay-to address can be considerable.
Every customer must be contacted, usually by mail, to inform them of the new
lockbox address to which they must now send their payments. If they do not com-
ply (a common occurrence), someone must make a reminder call. If there are
many customers, this can be a major task to complete and may not be worthwhile
if the sales to each customer are extremely small—the cost of contacting them
may exceed the profit from annual sales to them. Thus, a company with a small
number of customers or many low-volume customers may not find it cost-effec-
tive to use a lockbox.

An additional issue is the number of lockboxes that should be used. A com-
pany cannot maintain an infinite number of them, since each one has a fixed cost
that can add up. Instead, a common approach is to periodically hire a consultant,
sometimes provided by a bank, who analyzes the locations and average sales to
all customers, calculates the average mail float for each one, and offsets this
information with the cost of putting lockboxes in specific locations. The result of
this analysis will be a cost-benefit calculation that trades off excessive mail float
against the cost of additional lockboxes to arrive at the most profitable mix of
lockbox locations.


6-4 Consolidate Bank Accounts 115

A final issue is what to do with the residual checks that will continue to
arrive at a company. Despite its best efforts, some customers will ignore all lock-
box addresses and continue to send their checks directly to a company. When this
happens, the controller can either process the checks as usual, using all the tradi-
tional control points, or simply have the mailroom staff put all the checks into an
envelope and mail them to the lockbox. The latter approach is frequently the best
because it allows a company to completely avoid all cash deposit procedures. The
only case where the traditional cash-processing approach may still have to be fol-
lowed is when a company is in extreme need of cash and can deposit the funds
more quickly by walking them to the nearest bank branch to deposit immediately.
Otherwise, all checks should be routed through the lockbox.

Consequently, one or more lockboxes can be a highly effective way to avoid
the cumbersome check deposit procedure, while also accelerating the speed of
incoming cash flows. In only a minority of situations will a lockbox not be a cost-
effective alternative.

6-4 CONSOLIDATE BANK ACCOUNTS V Author’s Choice

A time-consuming chore at the beginning of each month is to complete reconcili-
ations between the bank statements for all the company’s bank accounts and the
book balances it maintains for each of those accounts. For example, a retail store
operation may have a separate bank account for each of hundreds of locations,
each of which must be reconciled. Also, if it is the controller’s policy to wait for
all bank accounts to be reconciled before issuing financial statements, this can be
the primary bottleneck operation that keeps financial statements from being
issued in a timely manner. Finally, having many bank accounts raises the possi-
bility that cash will linger in all of those accounts, resulting in less total cash
being available for investment purposes. To use the previous example, if there are
100 retail stores and each has a bank account in which is deposited $5,000 (a
decidedly modest sum for a single location), then $500,000 has been rendered
unavailable for investment. Thus, having a multitude of bank accounts leads to a
variety of downstream problems, which can seriously impact the efficiency of
some portions of the accounting department, while also reducing the amount of
cash readily available for investment purposes.

The best way to resolve the multi-account problem is to merge as many of
them together as possible. To use the previous example, rather than give a bank
account to each store, it may be possible to issue a fixed number of checks to
each location, all of which will be drawn upon the company’s central bank
account. This reduces the number of bank accounts from 100 to one. If anyone
feels that there is a danger of someone fraudulently cashing a large check on the
main bank account, this problem can be resolved by mandating a maximum


116 Cash Management Best Practices

amount for each check, above which the bank will not honor the check. By limit-
ing the amount per check and the number of checks, this control effectively
resolves any risk of a major fraud loss by consolidating all bank accounts. This is
also an effective approach when acquiring another company, since its bank
accounts can be merged into the existing account. In both cases, reducing the
number of accounts also makes it much easier to track the cash balances in each
account. Thus, account consolidation is an effective approach for improving
accounting efficiency as well as the management of cash flows.

There are some problems to consider before consolidating bank accounts.
One is that there may be automatic withdrawals taken out of an account. If the
account is closed down and merged into a different account, the automatic with-
drawal will be terminated, resulting in an unhappy supplier who is no longer
receiving any money. To avoid this problem, the transactions impacting each
account must be reviewed to ensure that all automatic withdrawals are being
shifted to the consolidated account. Also, there are legal reasons for keeping
some accounts separate, such as a cafeteria plan account, into which employee
deductions are deposited and from which a plan administrator withdraws funds.
Finally, consolidating too many bank accounts may result in a very difficult bank
reconciliation chore. Sometimes it is easier to keep a small number of separate
accounts, just to make the reconciliation process somewhat easier to untangle and
resolve. However, with the exception of these few cases, it is generally possible
to reduce the number of a company’s bank accounts to a bare minimum, resulting
in greater efficiency and more cash available for investment.

6-5 IMPLEMENT AREA-CONCENTRATION BANKING

Perhaps the greatest cash management problem, especially for a company with
many locations, is what to do with a multitude of bank accounts. When trying to
find a way to invest excess funds most efficiently, it is necessary to call all banks
with which a company has an account, check on the balance in each account,
determine how much of that amount can be safely extracted for investments with-
out increasing the risk of having a presented check bounce due to a lack of funds,
shift the excess funds to a central account, and finally invest it in an interest-bear-
ing account of some kind. To conduct this much work every day may take up all
of the time of several people, depending on the number and location of accounts.
A tedious chore indeed, and one that may take up the largest proportion of the
cash management staff’s time.

The best way to avoid all of this work is to create an area-concentration
banking system. This best practice automatically shifts funds from outlying bank
accounts into regional accounts, from which the cash management staff can
invest funds more easily. Under this arrangement, a company’s bank is asked to


6-6 Implement Controlled Disbursements 117

automatically clear out the excess funds in an account every day, forwarding the
money to a single account for each bank. Most banks will not automatically for-
ward money to an account at a different bank, so the money tends to stop at an
account within the geographical region covered by the bank. This still reduces the
number of accounts sufficiently to make it much easier for the cash management
staff to determine the amount of cash available. To avoid the problem of not
being able to automatically transfer cash between banks, some companies are
transferring all of their business to those large banks that have established a
national presence, so that a complete automatic centralization of all funds can be
achieved, no matter where in the country an account may be located. To make
this concept work properly, it is necessary to set up all outlying bank accounts as
lockboxes, only meant to receive cash (see the “Collect Receivables through
Lockboxes” section earlier in this chapter), with all disbursements coming out of
a single, centralized account, to which funds are only doled out as needed. By
using this approach, a cash management staff can eliminate the majority of its
clerical work.

An area-concentration banking system is an excellent way to efficiently con-
solidate a company’s cash holdings, but there are some problems with it. One is
that it may require the complete revision of the existing banking system, no
longer using a number of smaller banks that may not offer this service in favor of
a single national bank that does. In addition, as the bank will charge a fee for
each cash transfer, there must be a minimum volume of cash moving through the
system each day to make this arrangement a cost-effective one. Finally, this
method assumes that disbursements are from one location, so that no extra funds
must be distributed to outlying bank accounts that are needed to cover outstand-
ing checks. It can sometimes be quite difficult to revise the existing system of
bank accounts, especially due to the pressure by local managers who want to
retain their existing accounts, in order for the company to establish the most effi-
cient area-concentration banking layout.

Though the attainment of an area-concentration banking system may require
a significant amount of time, it is a best practice of particular help to those com-
panies with a national presence, a multitude of bank accounts, and a significant
amount of cash flow.

6-6 IMPLEMENT CONTROLLED DISBURSEMENTS

The person who is in charge of managing corporate cash flows is always trying
to find ways to retain cash legitimately for as long as possible, to invest it,
thereby earning interest for a company. There are unethical ways of doing so,
such as not paying suppliers even when previously agreed-upon pay dates have


118 Cash Management Best Practices

been surpassed. However, these activities can destroy a company’s reputation
with its suppliers and even impact its credit rating.

A legitimate way to retain cash for an extra day or two is to use controlled
disbursements. This best practice is based on the principle of mail float, which
means that one can print and immediately mail a check to pay for an invoice on
its due date, and the supplier can receive and cash it, but the check will not clear
for a day or two longer than was previously the case, resulting in extra time dur-
ing which a company still has control over its funds. For example, a company in
Denver can issue checks that are made payable to a bank in Aspen, Colorado,
which, due to its isolated location, requires an extra day for checks to clear. When
checks are presented to the Aspen location for payment, a daily batch of cash
required to cover the payments is forwarded to the company’s primary bank. The
company can access this cash requirement information every day and forward
just enough money to the controlled disbursement account to cover cash require-
ments for that day. These extra steps give a company the capability to keep virtu-
ally all of its excess cash in investments, extracting only the bare minimum each
day to cover immediate cash requirements. Thus, controlled disbursements not
only allow a company to retain its cash longer, but also to use the new off-site
bank account as a zero-balance account. Both of these actions can significantly
increase the amount of a company’s operating funds on hand.

Though a sound best practice to use, there are a few issues involved with a
controlled-disbursements account to consider. One is that the amount of addi-
tional float made available through this method is gradually shrinking, as the Fed-
eral Reserve Bank gradually eliminates those pockets of inefficient-check clear-
ing throughout the country. This may require a company to periodically change
the location of the bank that it uses as its check-clearing point. Eventually, the
longest additional float time to be gained by this method will probably be limited
to a single day. Also, the concept is one of the most expensive bank services.
Consequently, the cost must be carefully calculated and offset against projected
benefits to ensure that it is a worthwhile implementation project.

Given the cost of controlled disbursements, this is a best practice that is best
used by a company with a significant volume of cash flow, which ensures that the
incremental benefits of retaining a large amount of cash for an extra day or two
will adequately offset the cost of this service.

6-7 IMPLEMENT POSITIVE PAY AND REVERSE POSITIVE
PAY SYSTEM

Some organizations have a problem with check fraud, whereby checks are pre-
sented to the bank for payment that either were not issued by the company or
were issued for a lesser amount than is noted on the presented checks. Though


6-8 Negotiate Faster Deposited-Check Availability 119

not normally a major problem, some companies can lose a considerable amount
of money to fraudulent activities by this means.

A few banks now allow a company to use a program called “positive pay,”
which virtually eliminates check fraud. This best practice works by having a
company send to the bank a daily list of all checks issued, which is usually stored
in a specific data storage format that the bank can use to update its files of autho-
rized checks it is allowed to cash. All presented checks are compared to this mas-
ter list, with both the check number and amount being reviewed. If there is a dis-
crepancy, the check is rejected. By using this method, check fraud can be
completely eliminated.

A less expensive version of the positive pay system is one where the flow of
information is reversed, going from the bank to the company. Under the reverse
positive pay system, the bank faxes to the company a list of all checks presented
that day for payment. The company then reviews this list for any checks it does
not wish to honor and informs the bank of its decision before the close of busi-
ness that day. If the bank receives no notice by that time, then all checks on that
day’s list are honored for payment.

This best practice is being used only by a small number of companies, for
several reasons. One is that few banks currently offer the system (and usually
only large ones). Another problem is its cost. Even if a participating bank is will-
ing to provide the service for free, there is still a cost for the company because it
must pay to store check data on a tape and have it sent to the bank, usually using
an expensive overnight or same-day delivery service. Finally, a major problem is
that a company must make sure that all checks are included in the information it
sends to the bank, or else some checks may be rejected for payment—this can be
a major problem if manual checks are not immediately loaded into the account-
ing database. Consequently, positive pay is only useful in a minority of situations.

6-8 NEGOTIATE FASTER DEPOSITED-CHECK AVAILABILITY

One of the standard tricks used by banks to create a larger store of funds that they
can invest is to delay the availability of money from deposited checks. One can
see delays of as long as five days for some checks, and much longer periods for
checks drawn on international banks, even though the checks may have cleared
much sooner. As a general rule, if checks are not clearing the bank within two
days, then it is time to either negotiate with the bank to reduce the amount of float
it is taking or to switch to another bank that is willing to make money available
within a shorter time frame.

This option is not a realistic one for smaller businesses, since they have min-
imal leverage with their banks. Also, some companies that deal with many out-
of-state customers will experience a much slower actual check-clearing time than


120 Cash Management Best Practices

those whose customers are located within the same state—this simply reflects the
mechanics of the check-clearing process, and cannot be accelerated below a min-
imum level.

6-9 OPEN ZERO-BALANCE ACCOUNTS

Whenever a company cuts a check to a supplier, it must deposit enough cash in
its checking account to cover payment on the check. If it does not do so, then the
bank may not honor the check when it is presented for payment, or it may
advance payment but charge a fee for doing so. In either case, the penalties are
considerable for not having sufficient cash on hand to cover company obliga-
tions. Many companies run the risk of not having sufficient funds on hand
because they want to earn interest on their money for as long as possible (most
checking accounts do not pay interest, or very little). Accordingly, the typical
organization assigns someone the task of monitoring the rate at which checks are
being cashed, guesses when checks will be cashed, and uses all sorts of time-
consuming averaging methods to make a reasonable guess as to how much
money should be left in the account each day. Not only is this an expensive way
to manage cash, but sometimes those guesses are wrong, resulting in bounced
checks or additional bank fees.

The zero-balance account is a better way. As its name implies, the zero-
balance account requires no balance. Instead, when checks are presented to the
bank for payment, the bank automatically transfers money from another com-
pany account, in the exact amount required to cover the check. This approach
allows a company to eliminate the amount of funds stored in various bank
accounts, which results in the storage of all funds in just one account, where it is
easier to track and invest. There is also no problem with forgetting to manually
transfer funds into the zero-balance account because all transactions are handled
automatically. There is no risk of not having cash available to pay for a check,
unless there are no funds in the account from which money is automatically
being drawn. A common use of the zero-balance account is for payroll checks. A
variation on this type of account is the controlled disbursement account (see the
“Implement Controlled Disbursements” section earlier in this chapter), which is
most commonly used for accounts payable checks. By using either or both of
these types of accounts, a company can consolidate its funds into a central hold-
ing account, where it is both more visible and easily transferred out to various
investment vehicles.

There are few problems with having a zero-balance account. One is that the
bank will charge a small monthly fee for maintaining the account, but this
amount is easily offset by the interest earned on money that would otherwise
have been sitting in the account. In addition, some very small companies with


6-10 Proliferate Petty-Cash Boxes 121

limited banking needs do not bother with a zero-balance account because they do
not like the notion of having extra complexity in their banking procedures. These
small organizations prefer to handle all banking transactions through a single
bank account, which is certainly an acceptable approach when there is a limited
volume of cash flow in and out of a company. With the exception of these two
cases, however, most companies will find that having a zero-balance account is
an excellent way to centralize their funds in a single location.

Cost: SS Installation time:

6-10 PROLIFERATE PETTY-CASH BOXES

One of the greatest nuisances for the accounts payable staff is when it receives a
constant stream of requests from all over the company for manual checks in very
small amounts, usually for small daily transactions that cannot possibly be antic-
ipated, such as for flowers for an employee who is in the hospital or fees for an
emergency building repair. When these manual checks are cut, it is a common
occurrence to forget to log them into the computer system, resulting in a difficult
bank reconciliation process for an accounting clerk, as well as cash balances that
are lower than expected—both problems that impact the orderly management of
cash. One way to offset this problem is to give departments their own checking
accounts or even a set of checks that are drawn on the main checking account.
The first option requires additional bank reconciliations, and both options will
probably result in even more checks not initially recorded in the computer sys-
tem. In short, the need for small amounts of cash can add up to a moderate
headache for the cash management staff.

A good way to avoid this problem is to set up a number of small petty-cash
boxes in those areas of the company where cash requests are the most common.
A person in each department is made responsible for the cash in each box, trained
in how to record cash receipts and expenditures, and allowed to handle all cash
transactions from that point forward. To ensure that there is proper control, the
internal audit staff may reconcile the balances in each petty-cash box from time
to time. By using this approach, the demand for manual checks will be signifi-
cantly reduced, improving the accuracy of the cash book balance while also mak-
ing the bank reconciliation process a much easier one. The only problem with
this method is that there is some risk of theft from the petty-cash boxes, but this
risk is a minor one, given the small amount of cash kept in the boxes. On the
whole, this is a good best practice to use in situations where a company is having
difficulty in precisely determining its cash balances.

6-11 SHIFT MONEY WITH ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER

The cash management staff is sometimes called upon to make money transfers
that are either very large or complex or are on a rush basis. A good example of
this situation is a letter of credit (LOC), commonly used for international transac-
tions. The paperwork needed to initiate an LOC is exceedingly lengthy and is
usually wrong on the first try, requiring some additional iterations before it is cor-
rect. Another example is a large payment that must go to a supplier at once, pos-
sibly to avert a loss of credit standing. This may require a hand-carried local
delivery or an overnight express delivery to the supplier. In any of these cases, the
cash management staff will take an inordinate proportion of its time to process
the movement of funds. There must be an easier way.

There is, and it is the wire transfer. This transaction is handled through a
company’s bank, which can shift money out of the company’s bank account in
minutes and route it to the supplier’s account, even if it is located at another bank.
There is little paperwork and no hand-carrying of checks. To function properly, a
company needs the recipient’s bank account number and bank routing number.
The person sending the funds (who must be authorized to do so, with this autho-
rization on file at the bank) then faxes the transfer information to the bank and
waits for the transfer to take place. To make the process even more efficient, one
can have fax forms already prepared for the most common wire transfer destina-
tions, with all of the bank account information already filled in. A more advanced
setup used by larger companies is to have all the wire transfer information stored
in the computer system, so that wire transfer information can be sent electroni-
cally to the bank. Yet another version is to send wire transfers by accessing the
bank’s database on-line and performing all the work oneself. With all of these
options for sending money to suppliers, there is bound to be an approach that
meets the particular needs and resources of any company.

Despite the obvious nature of this best practice, it is surprising how rarely it
is used. By maintaining a database of recipient bank information, however, this
can become a simple matter that can be converted into a routine procedure,
improving the efficiency of the cash management function.

6-12 USE INTERNET-BASED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS SOFTWARE

Larger corporations will find that the task of consolidating and investing the cash
flows from their multitude of subsidiaries is an extremely labor-intensive process,
involving the collection of information from every company location about
cash requirements and excess amounts, logging in related transactions, and
managing the flow of cash from perhaps hundreds of accounts to centralized
investment vehicles—and doing so every day. The labor associated with this


6-12 Use Internet-Based Cash Flow Analysis Software 123

work may remind one of the years-long work of a group of monks who write a
book by hand.

A much easier approach is to use Internet-based software to more rapidly
marshal the flow of information. An example of such software is provided by
eTreasury (which is located at www.etreasury.com). Under this approach, a user
organization signs up with eTreasury, which is paid on a subscription basis, and
gives it the company’s list of banks and bank accounts. The staff of eTreasury
then takes two to three days to contact each bank and arrange for automated port-
ing of the company’s cash transactions to the eTreasury site, where they are com-
bined and reconciled. This results in a daily cash position worksheet that the
accounting and finance staffs can use to determine the correct borrowing or
investing decisions for the day. Because of the great reduction in labor that would
otherwise have been required to create the cash position worksheet, this also
means that the information will be available much earlier in the day than would
otherwise be the case, yielding more time in which to make the best cash man-
agement decisions.

In addition to this basic function, the site allows users at remote locations to
enter special transactions, such as requests for wire transfers, directly into the
site. This allows users at the corporate headquarters to see all cash-related trans-
actions at the same time, while avoiding the use of manual entries of these trans-
actions, which usually involve faxes of requested transactions from outlying loca-
tions, that are then keypunched into a central electronic spreadsheet.

This approach also carries with it the advantages associated with any appli-
cation service provider (ASP), such as the avoidance of any investment in soft-
ware or hardware, or the information technology staff that would otherwise be
needed to maintain an internal installation. Furthermore, the responsibility for
keeping the site up and running at all times falls on the supplier, rather than the
accounting or treasury department. In addition, eTreasury has a data file down-
load that can be modified for automated porting to a company’s general ledger, so
that cash transactions can be integrated with internal accounting systems with a
minimum of effort.

There are some disadvantages to using Internet-based treasury software. One
problem is that access to it is predicated on the reliability of Internet access,
which still does not match the reliability of internal networks. Also, these sites
are designed for companies with a smaller range of banking relationships (in the
case of eTreasury, information from four banks is the maximum allowable
amount that will be automatically collected and presented); for those with a
larger number of relationships, it is still necessary to purchase more expensive
software and install it in-house. However, despite these problems, the use of an
Internet-based treasury site may be well worth the effort for those organizations
that are currently spending a large amount of staff time consolidating banking
information for investment and borrowing purposes.

124 Cash Management Best Practices

6-13 UTILIZE AN INVESTMENT POLICY

Sometimes a controller or treasurer implements all of the cash management best
practices and experiences a singular increase in cash flows, only to have no idea
of what to do with the money. Though it is always tempting to invest the money
in some high-yield investment, there may be associated problems with risk or liq-
uidity that make such investment inappropriate. In fact, an improper investment
that results in losses or no chance of short-term liquidity to meet immediate
needs may even cost the investment officer his or her job. Consequently, this is an
area in which a best practice is needed, not to improve efficiency or profits, but to
contain risk.

An appropriate best practice for every company is an investment policy. This
is used to define the level of risk a company is willing to tolerate and defines the
exact types of investment vehicles to be used (or not used). Such a policy should
cover the level of allowable liquidity. For example, the policy may state that all
investments must be capable of total liquidation upon notification, or that some
proportion of investments must be in this class of liquidity. For example, the pol-
icy could state that 75 percent of all investments must be capable of immediate
liquidation (which rules out real estate holdings!), or that any investments over a
base level of $50 million can be invested in less-liquid instruments. Generally
speaking, the policy should severely restrict the use of any investments that can-
not be liquidated within 90 days, since this gives a company maximum use of the
money in case of special opportunities (such as an acquisition) or emergencies
(such as a natural disaster destroying a facility). Such careful delineation of
investment liquidity will leave a small number of investments that an investment
officer can safely use.

The other main policy criterion is risk. Many companies have decided that
they are not in the business of making investments and so they avoid all risk, even
though they may be losing a significant amount of investment income by putting
all excess cash in U.S. government securities. Other companies take the opposite
tack and attempt to derive a significant proportion of their profits from investment
income. No matter which direction a company takes, it is necessary to delineate
which kinds of investments can be used, thereby keeping the investment officer
focused on a specific set of investment options. The policy may go into such
detail as to define exact types of securities to be used.

Once the investment policy is in place, the investment officer can use it to
standardize the procedure for daily investing activities. For example, if only one
type of investment is authorized (a common situation), then a clerk can be autho-
rized to increase or decrease the investment amount each day, using a standard
investment form for transmission to the investing organization (e.g., a bank or
brokerage house). With this approach, investing becomes a simple and mechani-
cal activity that requires little further management attention.

An investment officer should strongly encourage the creation and use of an
investment policy, for it keeps the officer from being held liable in the event of a

TOTAL IMPACT OF BEST PRACTICES ON THE CASH
MANAGEMENT FUNCTION

An accounting department is well advised to implement nearly all of the best
practices advocated in this chapter, for most of them work well together to cen-
tralize funds for easier investment, while accelerating the flow of incoming cash
and slowing its outflow. The layout of the recommended best practices is shown in
the flowchart in Exhibit 6.3. That flowchart shows that most cash management best
practices are concentrated in just two areas—the inflow of cash from customers
and its outflow to suppliers. To make these best practices work most efficiently, it
is best to implement them fully in either of these two main areas in order to
achieve the most efficient flow of cash. For example, the subcategory of cash
inflows should be completely implemented, which means installing both the
lockbox and area-concentration banking best practices, prior to moving on to the
other subcategory of cash outflows. If one were to take a more scattershot approach
to implementing these best practices, the efficiency of the overall process would
be severely degraded. For example, implementing the lockboxes without area-
concentration banking would run the risk of having received funds sit idle in various
bank accounts around the country, since the area-concentration banking practice,
which automatically moves the funds into a central account, has not yet been
implemented.

If it is not possible, for whatever reason, to implement a cluster of these best
practices, then it is best to first implement those with either the greatest cost-benefit
or else the one that will result in the greatest increase in operational efficiency.
Under this scenario, the best practices with the greatest cost-benefit impact would
be either controlled disbursements or lockboxes, since both approaches result in
the retention of cash for a longer period, which gives a company more days to
invest it. Alternatively, if efficiency is the main implementation criterion, then a
controller should strongly consider a combination of area-concentration banking
and reducing the number of bank accounts—both practices result in much less
work for the accounting staff in tracking where cash is located in a company’s
bank accounts. However, rather than focusing on a few best practices, it is best to
implement a complete cash management system; the resulting impact on cash
flows and profitability is worth the effort.

Exhibit 6.3 Impact of Best Practices on the Cash Management Function

SUMMARY

This chapter is unusual in that none of the best practices presented are mutually
exclusive, nor are any of them especially difficult to implement, and they can be
created at low cost, in most cases. As a result, this is a prime area for an account-
ing manager to explore in order to achieve the highest possible level of cash
management efficiency. Best of all, efficiency in this area directly equates to hav-
ing more cash available for investments, which has a direct impact on company


Summary 127

profits—one of the few functions covered in this book in which corporate man-
agement can see an immediate and measurable impact as a result of implementing
best practices.

Given the high visibility of implementing cash management best practices, it
is important to install as many of them as possible. In particular, there should be a
set of lockboxes in place that will reduce the mail float from customers, as well as
consolidation accounts that accumulate funds from the lockbox accounts and
move them to the central bank account. There should also be zero-balance
accounts to handle cashed payroll checks, and a controlled-disbursement account
for paying suppliers. If this array of bank accounts is in place and is properly
managed, there should be a noticeable increase in the average amount of funds on
hand that can be profitably invested.

Collections Best Practices

One of the worst jobs in any company is collecting on overdue accounts receiv-
able. The person who must do the collecting never knows if an invoice has gone
unpaid due to the company’s fault or the customer’s. There may be a very valid
problem caused by the company that is making the customer wait on payment of
the invoice, such as a damaged product shipment, a billing for the incorrect
amount, or pricing that does not match the customer’s purchase order amount. In
these cases, the collections person apologizes to the customer for the company’s
sins and then tries to correct the internal problems responsible for the collection
trouble. In other cases, the collections problem may be caused by the customer,
who either cannot pay or who is deliberately stretching the payment period past
the agreed-upon date. In these cases, the collections person must diplomatically
bring pressure to bear on the customer, which is a difficult skill. No matter what
the reason for an invoice being overdue, the collections person must ascertain the
correct reason for the problem and fix it.

This chapter provides many best practices that allow a collections staff to
reduce the error rate of invoices being sent to customers, while also providing new
tools to force customers to pay by the due dates listed on company invoices. In
addition, there are several best practices here that can enhance the operational effi-
ciency of the collections staff. In short, this chapter makes the collections task easier,
while reducing the amount of overdue accounts receivable at the same time.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES FOR COLLECTIONS
BEST PRACTICES

There are a surprisingly large number of best practices that can be applied to col-
lections. Some are located in other functions, such as sales and credit, that have a
direct impact on the collections function, while others are more directly associated
with the activities of the collections department. Most of these best practices are
relatively inexpensive and easy to implement, as noted in Exhibit 7.1. The exhibit
notes the estimated cost and install time of implementation for each best practice.
In most cases, it is a relatively simple matter to complete an implementation, with the
exception of those items that require custom computer programming or that involve
the participation of another department. In these two cases, either the risk of a
lengthy programming project or the refusal of another department to cooperate

can jeopardize a successful implementation. An example of the first problem is
automatically faxing overdue invoices to customers, while a good example of the
second problem is persuading the sales department to adopt a simplified pricing
structure. However, with the exception of these two problem areas, one will find
that improving the collections function with the best practices contained in this
chapter is a relatively easy endeavor.

7-1 CLEARLY DEFINE ACCOUNT OWNERSHIP

The sales staff is frequently unwilling to make collection calls on behalf of the
accounting staff, because this takes away from their time in making new sales.
However, the best contact with the customer is the salesperson, who has probably
met with the customer multiple times and has built up a firm relationship, thereby
making the salesperson the most effective collections person a company has.

To improve the collections process, a company should clearly define who
“owns” each customer account and assign collection responsibility to the sales-
person who has been given account ownership. “Ownership” means that the
salesperson’s name or sales region number should be included in the accounting
database for each customer name. This does not mean that the bulk of the sales
staff’s job is now collections, but rather that the accounting department’s collec-
tions staff can now call upon specific individuals in the sales department when
they feel that they will not otherwise collect payment on an invoice. To enhance
the cooperation of the sales staff in the enforcement of collections, the compensa-
tion of the sales department manager should be tied to the proportion of cash col-
lected from customers, which will entice this person to force the cooperation of
his or her staff with the accounting department.

This concept should also be extended to the collections staff. There are usu-
ally specific customer issues associated with the nonpayment of an invoice, which
must be repetitively researched if a collection problem is circulated throughout
the collection staff. A better approach is to assign customer accounts to specific col-
lections personnel. By doing so, they gain an understanding of each customer’s par-
ticular issues, as well as have a chance to build relationships with their accounts
payable counterparts at the customers’ place of business, which frequently results
in faster resolution of issues and therefore quicker payment by customers.

7-2 UTILIZE COLLECTION CALL STRATIFICATION

The typical list of overdue invoices is so long that the existing collections staff
cannot possibly contact all customers about all invoices on a sufficiently frequent
basis. This problem results in many invoices not being collected for an inordi-


7-3 Grant Percentage Discounts for Early Payment 131

nately long time. Additional problems that require time-consuming research may
include an incorrect product price, missing shipping documentation, or a claim
that the quantity billed is incorrect. Consequently, collection problems linger
longer than they should, resulting in slow collections and substandard cash flow.

A good approach for improving the speed of cash collection is to utilize col-
lection call stratification. The concept behind this approach is to split up, or strat-
ify, all of the overdue receivables and concentrate the bulk of the collections
staff’s time on the very largest invoices. By doing so, a company can realize
improved cash flow by collecting the largest dollar amounts sooner. The down-
side of this method is that smaller invoices will receive less attention and there-
fore take longer to collect, but this is a reasonable shortcoming if the overall cash
flow from using stratified collections is improved. To implement it, one should
perform a Pareto analysis of a typical accounts receivable listing and determine
the cutoff point above which 20 percent of all invoices will constitute 80 percent
of the total revenue. For example, a cutoff point of $1,000 means that any invoice
of more than $1,000 is in the group of invoices that represents the bulk of a com-
pany’s revenue. When it is necessary to contact customers for collections work, a
much higher number of customer contacts can be assigned for the invoices over
$1,000. For example, a collections staff can be required to contact customers
about all high-dollar invoices once every three days, whereas low-dollar contacts
can be limited to once every two weeks. By allocating the time of the collections
staff in this manner, it is possible to collect overdue invoices more rapidly.

The stratification approach can also be expanded to include other members of
a company. If there is an extremely large invoice that must be collected at once,
the collections staff can be authorized to request the services of other departments,
such as the sales staff, in making the collection. This approach needs to be limited
to large-dollar invoices, since the sales staff does not want to be making collection
calls all day. However, using the stratification approach, it is reasonable to request
their assistance in collecting the largest invoices. This approach is very effective
for accelerating the collection of large overdue accounts.

7-3 GRANT PERCENTAGE DISCOUNTS FOR EARLY PAYMENT

Some companies have large customers that pay late all the time. These customers
are important to the company, and the customers abuse the one-sidedness of the
relationship by stretching out their payments. In these cases, a company has little
leverage, for it will lose a significant volume of sales if it cuts off the errant cus-
tomers or cuts back on their credit limits.

In these cases, a company may have no choice other than to grant an early
payment discount to customers in order to bring in cash sooner. This approach is
especially effective if a company is in immediate need of cash. Also, accounts


132 Collections Best Practices

receivable that are outstanding for a long time period will require a number of
collection actions, whereas one that is paid immediately will not require any;
thus, the use of an early payment discount reduces the cost of collections.

The discount is an easy one to implement. A company usually prints the dis-
count on its invoices so that customers will see the discount the next time an
invoice is mailed to them. However, most customers already have payment terms
included in their payment databases and a sudden change in terms may not be
noticed. Accordingly, it may be necessary to call the customers’ accounts payable
staffs to notify them of the change. An alternative approach is to offer the dis-
count only to a few key customers that represent a high volume of sales or who
are constant late-payers. By reducing the number of customers who take dis-
counts, a company can make more selective use of this tool.

There are three problems with using an early payment discount. One is the
cost. To entice a customer into an early payment, the discount rate must be fairly
high. A common discount rate is 2 percent, which translates into a significant
expense if used by all customers. Another problem is that it is somewhat more dif-
ficult to apply cash against accounts receivable if a discount is taken. Depending
on the facility of the accounting software, an accounting clerk may have to go to
the extreme of manually calculating the discount amount taken and charging off
the difference to a special discounts account. Finally, a discount can be abused. If
a customer is already stretching its payments, it may take the discount rate without
shrinking its payment interval to the prescribed number of days. This can lead to
endless arguments over whether the discount should have been taken, which the
customer will win if it makes up a large enough percentage of a company’s sales.

Granting early payment discounts can significantly reduce the amount of a
company’s overdue accounts receivable, but this is at the high cost of the discount,
which can be abused by some customers. Accordingly, this best practice should be
used with care to improve the payment performance of selected customers.

7-4 CONDUCT IMMEDIATE REVIEW OF
UNAPPLIED CASH WV Author’s Choice

It is a common occurrence for a collections person to call a customer about an
overdue invoice, only to be told that the check was already sent. Upon further
investigation, the collections staff finds that, for a variety of reasons, the errant
check has been sitting in an accounting clerk’s “in” box for several weeks, wait-
ing to be applied to an invoice in the accounts receivable aging. Common reasons
for not performing this cash application include not having enough time, not
understanding what the check is intended to pay, or because there are unex-
plained line items on a payment, such as credits, that require further investigation
before the check can be applied.


7-5 Outsource Collections 133

None of the reasons for not applying cash are valid, given the consequences
of wasting the time of the collections staff. Only two solutions need to be
installed to ensure that cash is applied at once. First, cash application is always
the highest priority of whomever is responsible for cash applications, thereby
avoiding all arguments regarding other items taking priority, or not having
enough time to complete the task. Second, all cash must be applied, even if it is
only to an ‘“‘unapplied cash” category in the accounts receivable register for those
items that cannot be traced immediately to an open invoice. In these cases, sim-
ply having the total of unapplied cash for a customer clearly shown in the aged
accounts receivable listing is a clear sign that the customer is correct—it has paid
for an invoice and now the collections person knows how to apply the cash that
was already received. Applying cash to accounts receivable as soon as it is
received is critical to ensuring that the collections staff has complete information
about customer payments before calling a customer.

Ensuring that cash is applied on time is a key internal auditing task. Without
periodic review by a designated auditor, the person in charge of cash applications
may become lazy and delay some application work. To avoid this problem, audits
must be regularly scheduled and should verify not only that all cash is applied in
a timely manner, but that the amount of cash received each day matches the
amount applied. If these controls are rigidly followed, it becomes an easy matter
to enforce this most fundamental of best practices.

7-5 OUTSOURCE COLLECTIONS

Some companies have a very difficult time creating an effective collections
department. Perhaps the management of the function is poor, or the staff is not
well trained, or it does not have sufficient sway over other departments, such as
sales, to garner support in changing underlying systems in a way that will reduce
the amount of accounts receivable to collect. Whatever the reason or combination
of reasons may be, there are times when the function simply does not work. A
variation on this situation is when a collections staff is so overwhelmed with
work that it cannot pay a sufficient amount of attention to the most difficult col-
lection items. This is a much more common problem. In either case, the solution
may be to go outside the company for help.

The best practice that solves this problem is to outsource the entire function
or some portion of it. When doing so, a company sends its accounts receivable
aging report to a collections agency, which contacts all customers with overdue
invoices that have reached a prespecified age—perhaps 60 days old, or whatever
the agreement with the supplier may specify. The supplier is then responsible for
bringing in the funds. In exchange, the collections agency either requires a per-
centage of each collected invoice (typically one-third) as payment for its services


134 Collections Best Practices

or it charges an hourly rate for its efforts. It is almost always less expensive to pay
an hourly fee for collection services, rather than a percentage of the amounts col-
lected, though going with an hourly approach gives the supplier less incentive to
collect on old invoices. To counteract the reduced level of incentive, it is useful to
continually measure the collection effectiveness of the supplier, and switch to a
new supplier if only a low percentage of invoices is being collected. This can be
an effective approach for quickly bringing a trained group of collection profes-
sionals to bear on an existing collections problem.

Before deciding on the outsourcing route, one must consider a variety of impor-
tant issues that make this a solution for only a minority of situations. The first prob-
lem is cost. It is always cheaper to keep the collections function in-house because
the fees charged by any supplier must include a profit, which automatically makes
its services more expensive. This is a particularly important problem if the payment
method is a percentage of the invoices collected, since the percentage can be consid-
erable. Another problem is that this approach does not allow one to use most of the
other best practices that are discussed in this chapter—by moving the entire function
elsewhere, there is no longer any reason to improve the department’s efficiency.
Only a few best practices, those that involve other departments, such as the sales and
credit departments, are still available for implementation. Finally, and most impor-
tantly, outsourcing the collections function puts the emphasis of the department
squarely on collecting money, rather than on the equally important issue of correct-
ing the underlying problems that are causing customers to not pay their bills on time.
A collections supplier has absolutely no incentive to inform a company of why cus-
tomers are not paying, because by doing so it is giving a company information that
will reduce the number of overdue invoices and reduce the amount of its business.
For example, if a customer does not pay its bills because a company repeatedly mis-
prices the products it is selling, the collections agency will not inform the company
of its error because then the invoices will be fixed and there will be fewer invoices to
collect. All of these issues are major ones, requiring considerable deliberation before
a company decides to outsource its collections function. Typically, this best practice
should only be used in situations where a company wants to outsource the collection
of a few of its most difficult collection problems. In most other cases, it is infinitely
less expensive to go in search of a qualified manager who can bring the collections
department up to a peak level of efficiency.

7-6 SIMPLIFY PRICING STRUCTURE

A common problem for the collections staff is when it tries to collect on an
invoice that contains a pricing error. This problem most commonly arises when
the order entry staff has a complicated set of rules to follow when deriving pric-
ing. For example, rather than using a single price for each product, there may be a


7-7 Write Off Small Balances with No Approval 135

different price for various volume levels a customer orders—perhaps $1 per unit
if 1,000 units are ordered and $2 if only 500 units are ordered. The situation can
become even more complicated if there are special deals in place, such as an
extra 10 percent discount if an order is placed within a special time period, such
as the last week of the month. When all of these variations are included in the
pricing structure (and some companies have even more complicated systems), it
is a wonder that the order entry staff ever manages to issue a correct product
price! A special circumstance under which pricing becomes nearly impossible to
calculate is when the order entry department of an acquired company is merged
with that of the buying company, leaving the order entry people with the pricing
systems of the purchased company, as well as that of their own. This situation can
quickly result in bedlam. The inevitable result is that customers will frequently
disagree with the pricing on the invoices they receive and will not pay for them
without a long period of dissension regarding the correct price. Alternatively,
they will pay the price they think is the correct one, resulting in arguments over
the remainder. In either case, the collections staff must become involved.

The best practice that resolves this situation is a simplification of the pricing
structure. The easiest pricing structure to target is one that allows only one price
to any customer for each product, with no special discounts of any kind. By using
this system, not only does the collections staff have a much easier time, but so
does the order entry staff—there is no need for them to make complicated calcu-
lations to arrive at a product price. However, there are two main implementation
barriers to this approach: the sales staff and customers. The sales staff may be
used to using a blizzard of promotional discounts to move product and may also
have a long tradition of using volume discounts as a tool for shipping greater vol-
ume. Similarly, customers may be used to the same situation, especially those
that benefit from the current tangle of pricing deals. To work through these barri-
ers, it is critical for the controller to clearly communicate to senior management
the reasons why a complicated pricing structure causes problems for the collec-
tions and order entry staffs. The end result is usually a political tug-of-war
between the sales manager and controller; whoever wins is the one with the most
political muscle in the organization.

Thus, simplifying the pricing structure is one of the most obvious ways to
reduce the difficulty of collections, but it can be very difficult to implement
because of resistance from the sales staff. One must build a clear case in favor of
pricing simplification and present it well before the concept can become a reality.

7-7 WRITE OFF SMALL BALANCES WITH NO APPROVAL

The typical procedure for writing off a bad debt is for a collections person to
write up a bad debt approval form, including an explanation of why an account


136 Collections Best Practices

receivable is not collectible, which the controller must then review and sign. The
form is filed away, possibly for future review by auditors. This can be a time-
consuming process, but a necessary one if the amount of the bad debt is large.
However, some bad debts are so small that the cost of completing the associated
paperwork exceeds the bad debt. In short, the control point costs more than the
savings for small write-offs.

The obvious solution is to eliminate approvals for small amounts that are
overdue. A company can determine the appropriate amount for the upper limit of
items that can be written off; an easy way to make this determination is to calcu-
late the cost of the collections staff’s time, as well as that of incidental costs, such
as phone calls. Any account receivable that is equal to or less than this cost
should be written off. The timing of the write-off, once again, depends on the par-
ticular circumstances of each company. Some may feel that it is best to wait until
the end of the year before writing off an invoice, while others promptly clear
them out of the accounts receivable aging as soon as they are 90 days old. What-
ever the exact criteria may be, it is important for management to stay out of the
process once the underlying guidelines have been set. By staying away, manage-
ment is telling the collections staff that it trusts employees to make these deci-
sions on their own, while also giving managers more time to deal with other
issues. If managers feel that they must check on the write-offs, they can let an
internal audit team review the situation from time to time.

By avoiding the approval process for writing off small accounts receivable,
the collections staff avoids unnecessary paperwork while managers eliminate a
waste of their time.

7-8 COMPILE CUSTOMER ASSETS DATABASE

If a collections person finds that a customer will not pay, the usual recourse is to
reduce or eliminate the customer’s credit limit and to use threats—dunning letters
and phone calls. These instruments are frequently not sufficient to force a cus-
tomer to pay. However, what a collections person does not always realize is that
there may be some other customer assets on the premises that the company can
refuse to ship back to the customer until payment is made. When these assets are
grouped into a database of customer assets, the collections staff has a much better
chance of collecting on accounts receivable.

A customer assets database lists several items the customer owns, but which
are located on the company premises. One common customer asset is consigned
inventory. This is stock the customer has sent to the company either for resale or
for inclusion in a finished product the company is making for the customer.
Another customer asset is an engineering drawing or related set of product speci-
fications. Yet another is a mold, which the customer has paid for and which a


7-9 Maintain Customer Orders Database 137

company uses in the plastics industry to create a product for the customer. All of
these are valuable customer assets, which a company can hold hostage until all
accounts receivable are paid.

The best way to keep this customer assets information in one place is to store it
in the inventory database. The reason is that the inventory database is already set up
in most accounting systems and includes location codes, so that it is an easy matter
to determine where each asset is located. Most important in using this database, a
collections person can designate a customer in the accounting system as one to
which nothing can be shipped (with a shipping hold flag of some kind), which
effectively keeps the shipping department from sending the asset to the customer—
it cannot print out shipping documentation or remove the asset from the inventory
database. This is an extremely effective way to keep customer assets in-house,
rather than inadvertently sent back to a customer that refuses to pay its bills.

The only problem with this best practice is making sure that customer assets
are recorded in the assets database when they initially arrive at the company. Other-
wise, there is no record of their existence, making it impossible to use these assets
as leverage for the collections staff. The best answer to this problem is to force all
receipts through the receiving department, whose responsibility is to record all
receipts in the inventory database. The internal auditing staff can review the receiv-
ing log to verify that this action has been completed. The only customer asset that
may not be recorded in this manner is a set of engineering drawings, which enters
the company site through the engineering department, rather than the receiving
dock. The only way to record this information is by fostering close cooperation
with the engineering manager, who must realize the need for tracking all customer
assets. These steps will result in tight control over customer assets and a better
chance of collecting overdue accounts receivable by the collections staff.

7-9 MAINTAIN CUSTOMER ORDERS DATABASE

The previous section noted the need for compiling a listing of customer assets
that can be used to apply leverage to customers to collect on overdue accounts.
The same approach applies to customer orders. If a customer has a large open
order with a company, it is likely that the customer will be quite responsive to
pressure to pay for open invoices when those orders are put on hold. Conse-
quently, an excellent best practice to implement is to give the collections staff
current knowledge of all open orders.

Implementation of this practice is an easy one for most companies; just give
password access to the existing customer orders database to the collections staff.
This access can be read-only, so that there is no danger of a staff person inadver-
tently changing key information in a customer order. An additional issue is that
someone must be responsible for flagging customers as “do not ship” in the cus-


138 Collections Best Practices

tomer orders database. This is a necessary step since orders will inadvertently
pass through the system if there is not a solid block in the computer on shipments
to a delinquent customer. However, many companies are uncomfortable with
allowing the collections staff to have free access to altering the shipment status of
customers, since they may use it so much that customers are irritated. Conse-
quently, it may be better to allow this access only to a supervisor, such as an
assistant controller, who can review a proposed order-hold request with the sales
staff to see what the impact will be on customer relations before actually impos-
ing a hold on a customer order.

In summary, giving the collections staff access to the open orders database
for customers results in better leverage over delinquent customers by threatening
to freeze existing orders unless payment is made. The use of this database should
be tempered by a consideration for long-term relations with customers; it should
only be used if there is a clear collections problem that cannot be resolved in
some other way.

7-10 ARRANGE FOR AUTOMATIC BANKRUPTCY NOTIFICATION

It is an easy matter for a collections department to be completely blindsided by a
sudden drop in the credit rating of a customer, possibly resulting in bankruptcy
and the loss of all accounts receivable to that customer. Though a company can
track payment histories over time, talk to other suppliers of a customer, or period-
ically purchase credit records from a credit analysis group, all of these options
require a continual planned effort. Many collections departments do not have the
time to complete these extra tasks, even though the cost of being blindsided can
be very high. They just take the chance that customers will continue to be finan-
cially stable.

Rather than undergo the embarrassment of losing an account receivable
through the sudden decline of a customer, it is better to arrange for automatic
notification of any significant changes to the credit standing of a customer. To do
this, a company can contract with a major credit rating agency, such as Dun &
Bradstreet. This organization can fax or e-mail a notification of any changes to
the status of a customer, such as a change in the speed of its payment, adverse
legal judgments, or strikes, which may signal a decline in the customer’s ability
to pay its bills. With this information in hand, a credit manager can take immedi-
ate steps to shrink a customer’s credit limit and put extra emphasis on collection
efforts for all outstanding accounts receivable, thereby avoiding problems later
on, when a customer may sink into bankruptcy.

The only problem with advance notification of a customer’s credit standing
is that the credit agency will charge a fee for its work. However, the price of the
notification, usually in the range of $25 to $40, is minor compared to the poten-

tial loss of existing accounts receivable. The only case where a company would
not want to have advance notification set up is for customers that rarely make
orders and usually of a small size when they do; in this case, a small credit limit
is adequate protection against any major bad debt losses.

7-11 SET UP AUTOMATIC FAX OF OVERDUE INVOICES

The most common request that a collections person receives from a customer is
to send a copy of an invoice that the customer cannot find. To do so, the collec-
tions person must either access the accounting computer system to print out a
copy of the invoice or go to the customer’s file to find it. Then the collections per-
son must create a cover letter and fax the cover letter and invoice to the customer.
In addition, the fax may not go through, in which case the collections person
must repeat this process after learning from the customer that the fax never
arrived. This process is typically the longest of all collections tasks—a collection
call may only take a few minutes, but faxing an invoice can take several times
that amount.

Few companies have found a way around the faxing problem. Those that
have done so use the most advanced of all best practices in the collections area—
automatically extracting an invoice record from the accounting database and fax-
ing it to the customer—all at the touch of a button. To do so, a company must link
the invoice file in the accounting database to another file that contains the name
and fax number of the recipient, combine these two files to create a cover letter
and invoice, and route the two records to a fax server for automatic transmission,
one that will keep transmitting until the fax goes through, and then notify the
sender of successful or failed transmissions. The advantages of this approach are
obvious: immediate turnaround time, no need for the collections person to move
to complete a fax, and automatic notification if there is a problem in completing a
fax. For a company with a large collections staff, this represents a monumental
improvement in efficiency.

The trouble with setting up an automatic invoice-faxing system is that one
must put together several functions that are not normally combined. This almost
certainly calls for customized programming and may have a risk that the system
will periodically fail, due to the complex interlinking of different systems. To
give a picture of the complexity of this system, the front end of the system must
include an input screen for the collections person that allows entry of the cus-
tomer’s contact name and fax number, as well as any accompanying text that
should go on the cover letter to accompany the faxed invoice. On the same
screen, one should be able to enter an invoice number so that the software auto-
matically searches the invoice file and selects the correct invoice. There may be
an additional step at this point, where the system presents a text image of the


140 Collections Best Practices

invoice so that the collections person can verify that the correct invoice is about
to be transmitted. Next, both the invoice text and the information that goes on the
cover letter must be converted to a digital image that can be transmitted by fax.
After that, the images are transmitted to a server that is a stand-alone fax trans-
mission device. The server will repeatedly fax out the images to the recipient for
a fixed number of attempts. If the transmission is not successful, the fax server
will notify the sender via an e-mail message (which requires a preexisting e-mail
system); conversely, it should also send a message indicating a successful trans-
mission.

Obviously, it is a difficult task to combine the accounting database with fax
server and an e-mail system and expect it all to work properly at all times. Com-
mon problems are that information will not be successfully transmitted between
the various components of the system, resulting in no fax transmission, or that the
e-mail notification system does not work, resulting in no messages to the collec-
tions staff, who have no idea if their faxes are being sent or not. Consequently,
most companies with small collections staff do not deem it worth the effort to
attempt such an installation. Only the largest corporations, with correspondingly
large collections staffs, attempt to install this best practice.

7-12 ISSUE DUNNING LETTERS AUTOMATICALLY

Some companies have so many small accounts to collect that they cannot possi-
bly take the time to call all of them to resolve payment disputes. This is an espe-
cially common problem for very small accounts receivable, where the cost of a
contact call may exceed the amount of revenue outstanding. In other cases, there
is some difficulty in contacting customers by phone, usually because all collec-
tion calls are automatically routed to the voice mail of the accounts payable
departments. In these cases, a different form of communication is needed.

The best way to contact either unresponsive customers or accounts with very
small overdue balances is the dunning letter. This is a letter that lists the overdue
amount, the invoice number, and date, and requests payment. There are normally
several degrees of severity in the tone of the dunning letter; the initial one has a
respectful tone, assuming that there has been some mistake resulting in nonpay-
ment. There is a gradual increase in severity. The final letter is the most threaten-
ing and usually requires immediate payment within a specific number of days or
else the account will be turned over to a collection agency, the customer will be
converted to cash-on-delivery for all future sales, or some similar dire warning.
As it is impossible to craft a separate dunning letter for every customer situation
(given the cost of doing so), a collections department must create a standard set
of dunning letters that can be used for all customers. Though an informal way of
communicating, a form letter still gets the point across to the customer. There is


7-13 Use a Collection Call Database 141

also a standard time interval between the issuance of each in a series of dunning
letters—perhaps two weeks past the initial invoice due date before the first letter
is sent, with additional letters being sent every two weeks thereafter. This use of a
series of dunning letters, issued at standard intervals, is an effective and low-cost
way to communicate with customers for whom it is not cost effective or other-
wise possible to communicate.

There are various degrees of automation that can be applied to the use of
dunning letters. The easiest approach is to have a standard preprinted letter, easily
copied and mailed to a customer. The next level of automation is to store standard
letters in a computer network, where all collections personnel can access them
and make small modifications to match the customers to whom they are being
sent. Though simple, both of these approaches suffer from the same complaint—
there is no way to automatically issue dunning letters at set intervals. Instead, one
must rely on the collections staff to remember to send out the letters. A more
automated approach that takes into account the time interval since the last letter is
merging the dunning letters into the accounting software. To do so, some custom
programming is required. The programming must automatically access a text file
as soon as an invoice reaches a certain number of days past due and issue a dun-
ning letter. A different text file must be accessed as the number of days past due
increases, since more strident letters must be sent as the invoices become older.
The letters can then be printed and mailed out each day in a batch. Though this
last method provides the tightest control over the standard issuance of the correct
kinds of dunning letters, it is more complicated to set up, so it is generally best to
calculate the programming cost of making such a significant enhancement before
proceeding.

The automatic issuance of dunning letters is a cost-effective method for
establishing a continual communication with customers regarding overdue invoices.
It is particularly suitable to those situations where it is impossible to create per-
sonal relationships with customers through more expensive collection calls.

7-13 USE A COLLECTION CALL DATABASE WV Author’s Choice

A poorly organized collections group is one that does not know which customers
to call, what customers said during previous calls, and how frequently contacts
should be made in the future. The result of this level of disorganization is overdue
payments being ignored for long periods, other customers being contacted so fre-
quently that they become annoyed, and continually duplicated efforts. To a large
extent, these problems can be overcome by using a collection call database.

A typical collection call database is a simple one recorded on paper, or a
complex one that is integrated into a company’s accounting software package. In
either case, the basic concept is the same—keep a record of all contacts with the


142 Collections Best Practices

customer, as well as when to contact the customer next and what other actions to
take. The first part of the database, the key contact listing, should contain the fol-
lowing information:

¢ Customer name

¢ Key contact name

¢ Secondary contact name

¢ Internal salesperson’s name with account responsibility
¢ Phone numbers of all contacts

¢ Fax numbers of all contacts
The contact log comprises the second part of the database and should contain:

¢ Date of contact
¢ Name of person contacted
¢ Topics discussed

¢ Action items

The information noted is easily kept in a notebook if there is a single collec-
tions person, but may require a more complex, centralized database if there are
many collections personnel. In the latter case, a supervisor may need to monitor
collections activities for all employees, and he or she can do this more easily if
the data is stored in a single location. However, a notebook-based database can be
set up in a few hours with minimal effort, whereas a computerized database,
especially one that is closely linked to the accounting records for each account
receivable, may be a major undertaking. The reason for the added effort (and
expense) is that it may be necessary to custom-program extra text fields into the
accounting software so that notations can be kept alongside the record for each
invoice; this is a surprisingly difficult endeavor, given the number of changes that
must be made to the underlying database. The most difficult situation of all is if a
company uses a software package that is regularly updated by a software sup-
plier. Any changes made to the software (such as adding text fields) will be
destroyed as soon as the next upgrade is installed, since the upgrade will wipe out
all changes made in the interim.

A good midway approach for avoiding these difficulties with a computerized
database is to use a separate tracking system not linked to the accounting soft-
ware. Such software packages are commonly used by the sales department to
track contacts with customers and can be easily modified to work for a collec-
tions department. They can be modified for use by multiple employees, resulting

approach is that there is no linkage between the customer contact information

contained in the accounting software (e.g., names and addresses) and the same
information in the tracking software. This contact information must be reloaded
manually from the accounting software into the tracking software. Likewise, any
change to the contact information in the tracking software must be manually
updated in the accounting system. Despite its limitations, maintaining a separate
tracking system in the computer is an inexpensive way to maintain a centralized
contact database.

7-14 IMPLEMENT CUSTOMER ORDER EXCEPTION
TRACKING SYSTEM

Many of the problems that result in collections work begin much earlier, from the
time an order is entered into the system to the time it is produced, shipped, and
invoiced. This interval is not one that the collections staff has any direct control
over (unless the collections manager happens to run the entire company!), which
means that problems upstream from the collections department will nonetheless
have a direct and continuing impact on the quantity and type of problems that the
collections staff must handle.

A good best practice for rooting out problems before they become collection
issues is to set up a reporting system to track exceptions for customer orders as they
move through all of a company’s various processes. By keeping close tabs on these
reports, the manager of the collection function can tell when there will probably be
collection difficulties. By determining problems with specific customer orders in
advance, the collections manager can work with the managers of other departments
(mostly by suggestion) to correct problems before orders are shipped. A crucial fac-
tor in the success of this best practice is the interpersonal skill of the collections
manager, who must bring customer order exceptions to the attention of other man-
agers in such a way that they will not reactive negatively, but rather work with the
presented information to make prompt corrections to their systems.

Another use of the reports is to recognize which orders are likely to result in
collection problems and to use this information to start making collection calls
earlier than normal, so that any customer problems can be discovered, addressed,
and resolved before the associated accounts receivable become inordinately old.
By using the exception reports to manage accounts receivable more closely, it is
possible to maintain a high accounts receivable turnover ratio, which frees up
working capital for other purposes.

The number of reports used to track customer order exceptions will vary dra-
matically, depending on the types of systems already in place, the services or prod-
ucts offered to customers, and the type of industry. This range of options makes a
complete list of all exception reports impossible to present, but the following list
is a representative sample of the types of information that a collections manager


144 Collections Best Practices

should consider using as the foundation of a comprehensive order exception
tracking system:

¢ Customer orders with nonstandard prices
¢ Customer orders for which the delivery date has exceeded the requested date

¢ Customer orders for which the quantity on hand is less than the amount
ordered

¢ Customer orders for which the scheduled production is later than the
requested delivery date

¢ Customer orders for which partial deliveries have been sent
¢ Customer orders requiring special-order parts

¢ Customer orders requiring a special form of transportation
¢ Customer orders requiring a special form of packaging

All of these exception reports focus on nonstandard customer orders, or orders
for which there is some kind of shortfall. They are a very effective tool for honing
in on those orders for which there will probably be customer complaints, which
may result in collection problems.

The ability of a collections manager to create all these reports will depend on
the type of computer database used to collect data about customer orders. If the
database does not cover all of the items noted in the previous list of reports, it will
be very difficult to create the reports, unless it is cost-effective to do so manually.
Also, there should be a good report-writing tool or a willing programming staff to
assist in the creation of these reports. If these factors are in place, a collections
department can benefit greatly from an advance knowledge of which customer
orders are likely to result in collection problems.

7-15 INSTALL PAYMENT DEDUCTION INVESTIGATION SYSTEM

Customers usually deduct payment amounts from invoices they owe because of
problems caused by the originating company. Examples of these problems are
product returns caused by faulty products or incorrect order processing, product
damage due to incorrect shipment packaging, incorrect sales deals issued by sales
personnel, and promotional or advertising deductions for deals that were not
clearly specified by the marketing staff. Unfortunately, none of the staff in these
areas in which the problems originated are likely to hear about the resulting col-
lection problems, because the collection task is placed in the hands of a clerk, in
either the accounting or treasury departments, who is thoroughly overworked,
and who certainly has neither the tools nor the authority to drive corrective
changes back through the organization.


7-16 Link to Comprehensive Collections Software Package 145

The solution is to give this person the tools to do so, which can then be
accessed by a high-enough level of manager to ensure that corrective actions are
taken. A properly functioning deduction investigation system requires workflow
software in which one can route information about the problem to the appropriate
party. The software must be able to shift the action routing to different parties if
action is not taken by predetermined dates, thereby ensuring that action is taken
to correct deduction-related problems. The system must also allow one to review
the linked electronic images of related documentation associated with the specific
problem, which calls for a document digitizing system. Further, the system must
periodically summarize the various issues causing deductions to be taken, and
route this information to the senior management team, where they can spot
emerging problems and ensure that they are resolved. Finally, an implementing
company must have a central database for its various functional areas, such as is
provided by an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, so that all parties can
have ready access to the various stores of information throughout the company
that may relate to the issue at hand. Clearly, these requirements are expensive, but
they give one the opportunity to continually monitor the reasons for deductions
and fix the underlying problems causing them. This capability is invaluable not
only from the perspective of improving customer relations, but also because it
reduces the ongoing cost of dealing with payment deductions.

7-16 LINK TO COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTIONS
SOFTWARE PACKAGE

Many of the other system-related best practices noted in this chapter are based on
the assumption that a company wants to incrementally create separate applica-
tions that are directly linked to an existing accounting computer system. If so, a
fair amount of programming work will be required to arrive at a complete in-house
solution. This can be both expensive and time-consuming. For those who prefer
to install a complete solution on a more rapid time schedule, it is also possible to
purchase a software package that incorporates many of the system-related best
practices for collections.

An example of this new breed of software is GetPAID, which can be
reviewed at the www. getpaid.com Web site. This product is linked to a company’s
legacy accounting systems (specifically, the open accounts receivable and cus-
tomer files) by customized interfaces, so that there is either a continual or batched
flow of information into it. A key feature it offers is the assignment of each cus-
tomer to a specific collections person, so that each person can call up a subset of
the overdue invoices for which he or she is responsible. Within this subset, the
software will also categorize accounts in different sort sequences, such as placing
those at the top that have missed their promised payment dates. Also, the software


146 Collections Best Practices

will present on a single screen all of the contact information related to each
customer, including the promises made by customers, open issues, and contact
information. The system will also allow the user to enter information for a fax,
and then route it directly to the recipient, without requiring the collections person
to ever leave his or her chair. It can also be linked to an auto-dialer, so that the
collections staff spends less time attempting to establish connections with over-
due customers. To further increase the efficiency of the collections staff, it will
even determine the time zone in which each customer is located and prioritize the
recommended list of calls, so that only those customers in time zones that are
currently in the midst of standard business hours will be called.

The GetPAID system does not just store collections data—it can also export
it to other systems, where it can be altered for other uses or reformatted for man-
agement reporting purposes (though the package contains its own reporting fea-
tures, as well). Some of the standard reports include a time-series report on per-
formance of individual collection personnel, as well as the same information for
each customer. It can also create reports that are tailored by recipient—for exam-
ple, all of the collection problems for a specific salesperson’s customers can be
lumped into one report and sent to that salesperson for remedial action. The soft-
ware can also export data files into Excel or Access.

There are several cost issues to consider when installing this type of soft-
ware—not only of the software itself, but also for staff training time, installation
by consultants, and ongoing maintenance costs. Offsetting these problems is a
much shorter time period before a company will have an advanced collections
software system fully operational. The record time period for a GetPAID installa-
tion is just five days, though a more typical installation speed is 60 days. For
those companies with a serious collections problem and that need help right
away, a comprehensive collections software package may be the answer.

7-17 INSTITUTE LOCKBOX COLLECTIONS

Customers sometimes have difficulty in sending their payments to the correct
address; they send them to the attention of someone they know at a company, such
as a salesperson, or they send it to the wrong company location. Sometimes, even if
they send a payment to the correct company location, the mailroom personnel mis-
takenly direct the payment to the wrong department, where it languishes for a few
days until it is rerouted to the correct person. Finally, even if the payment goes to
the correct person in the correct department, that person may not be available for a
few days, perhaps due to sickness or vacation. In all of these instances, there is a
delay in cashing checks and, more importantly from a collections standpoint, there
is a delay in applying checks to open accounts receivable. When this delay occurs,


7-18 Preapprove Customer Credit 147

the collections staff may make unnecessary phone calls to customers who have
already paid, which is a waste of time. How can one eliminate this problem?

The easiest method for consolidating all incoming payments is to have them
sent to a lockbox, a mailbox that is maintained by a company’s bank. The bank
opens all incoming envelopes, cashes all checks contained therein, and then for-
wards copies of the checks to a single individual at the company. The advantage of
this approach is that if all customers are properly notified of the address, all checks
will unerringly go to one location, where they are consolidated into a single packet
and forwarded to the cash application person at the company. By sending a single
packet of each day’s receipts to a single person, it is much easier to ensure that the
packet is routed to the correct person for immediate application. However, there
are two disadvantages that must be considered. One is that there is a one-day delay
in routing checks through a lockbox, which translates into a one-day delay in
applying the cash. The other problem is that all customers must be notified of the
change to the lockbox address, which usually requires several follow-up contacts
with a few customers who continue to send their payments to the wrong address.
Despite these restrictions, a collections staff that suffers from mislaid check pay-
ments should seriously consider switching to a lockbox solution.

Cost: aS Installation time:

7-18 PREAPPROVE CUSTOMER CREDIT

The collections staff suffers severely from credit that is granted after the sales
force makes a sale to a customer. The typical situation is that a salesperson finds a
new customer and makes an inordinately large sale to it; the salesperson then
badgers the credit department to grant a large credit limit to the customer since
there is a large commission on the line. The credit staff yields to this pressure and
allows more credit than the supplier’s credit history warrants, resulting in a diffi-
cult collection job for the collections staff. The answer to this quandary lies in
fixing the credit-granting process well before the collections staff even knows the
new customer exists.

An outstanding best practice for those companies that want to avoid bad debt
situations is to work closely with the sales staff to create a “hit list” of new cus-
tomer prospects before any sales effort is made to contact them. The credit staff
then reviews existing credit information about these customers, which is easily
gleaned from credit reporting agencies, and calculates the credit levels that it is
comfortable granting. These credit levels are given to the sales staff, which now
knows the upper limits of what it is allowed to sell to each customer. This
approach greatly reduces the pressure that salespeople are wont to bring on the
credit staff for higher credit limits. A major by-product of this process is that the
collections staff no longer has to deal with inordinately high accounts receivable
with customers who have no way of paying on time.


148 Collections Best Practices

The only problem with this approach is that a great deal of intra-departmental
discipline is needed. The sales manager, in particular, must be able to carefully
plan in advance for upcoming sales campaigns and control the sales staff in fol-
lowing sales targets. In addition, this person must see the importance of setting
up credit levels in advance and must be able to work closely with the credit
department in granting appropriate credit levels. If this type of person is not run-
ning the sales department, it will be difficult to enforce this best practice.

Thus, planning carefully to grant appropriate levels of credit to customers
before the sales force contacts them is an excellent way to reduce the number of
customers the collections staff must contact.

7-19 CREATE STANDARDIZED CREDIT LEVEL
DETERMINATION SYSTEM

A common complaint of the collection staff is that there does not appear to be
any reasoning behind the credit levels that are granted customers, resulting in
inordinately high credit levels for some customers that cannot begin to repay
their debt. This results in considerable effort for the collections staff to bring in
cash from these customers, as well as pleas to the credit department to lower
credit to levels that have some reasonable chance of being repaid. This condition
is caused by the approach of many credit departments to granting credit, which is
that they grant the highest possible credit level to meet the latest order received
from a customer. This approach is advocated heavily by the salesperson who
stands to receive a substantial commission if the sale is approved. Consequently,
granting credit based on the size of a customer’s order rather than its ability to
pay leads to considerable additional collections work.

To solve the problem of an uncertain credit-granting standard, one must cre-
ate a procedure for granting credit that uses a single set of rules that are not to be
violated, no matter how much pressure the sales staff applies to expand credit
levels. The exact procedure will vary by credit department and the experience of
the credit manager. As an example, a credit person can obtain a credit report for a
prospective customer and use this as a source of baseline information for deriving
a credit level. A credit report is an excellent basis upon which to create a standard
credit level, for the information contained in it is collected in a similar manner for
all companies, resulting in a standardized and highly comparable basis of infor-
mation. Such a credit report should include a listing of the high, low, and median
credit levels granted to a customer by other companies, giving a credit manager
the range of credit that other companies have determined is appropriate. How-
ever, just using the range of credit levels is not normally sufficient, since one
must also consider the number of extra days beyond terms that a customer takes
to pay its customers. This information is a good indicator of creditworthiness and


7-20 Add Receipt Signature to Invoice 149

is also contained in a credit report. A good example of how the “‘payment” infor-
mation can be included in the calculation of a credit level is to take the median
credit level other companies granted as a starting point and then subtract 5 per-
cent of this amount for every day that a customer pays its suppliers later than
standard payment terms. For example, if the median credit level is $10,000, and a
customer pays an average of 10 days late, 50 percent of the median credit level is
taken away, resulting in a credit level for the customer of $5,000. The exact sys-
tem a company uses will be highly dependent on its willingness to incur credit
losses and expend extra effort on collections. A company willing to obtain more
marginal sales will adopt the highest credit level shown in the credit report and
not discount the impact of late payments at all, whereas a risk-averse company
may be inclined to use the lowest reported credit level and further discount it
heavily for the impact of any late payments by the potential customer.

The range of standard procedures for granting credit levels is infinite. The
main point is to have one consistent basis for creating reasonable customer credit
levels, which gives the collections staff far less work to collect on sales that
exceed the ability of a customer to pay. The procedure presented in this section
involves using the information shown on a credit report, but other sources of
information can also be used.

Cost: SS Installation time:

7-20 ADD RECEIPT SIGNATURE TO INVOICE

There may be cases where customers demand proof of their receipt of a delivery
from the company before they will pay its invoice. Normally, this proof is gener-
ated internally by the customer through the use of a receiving log or the forward-
ing of bill of lading information to the accounting department. However, there are
cases where there is a paperwork disconnect between the customer’s accounting
and receiving functions, so that some company invoices are not paid for long
periods of time, while the customer scrambles to find evidence of receipt.

This problem can be reduced by using either FedEx or United Parcel Service
to make deliveries, since both organizations post receipt signatures on their Web
sites. One can then copy the signature images out of the Web sites and paste them
directly into an invoice, thereby providing proof of receipt to the customer on the
invoice. If necessary, the billing staff can also add the delivery reference number
used by either United Parcel Service or FedEx to the invoice. Either the customer
or the company can then go straight to the Web sites of either package delivery
company to obtain further evidence of the time and place of delivery of the pack-
age in question. This approach has the distinct advantage of consolidating both
the billing and receiving information for a delivery on one piece of paper. The
downside is that the invoice cannot be issued until the delivery has been received
by the customer, rather than being sent when the package leaves the company’s


150 Collections Best Practices

premises. Also, one must always use either of these package delivery companies
in order to have access to the signature information, when there may be less
expensive shipping options available.

7-21 E-MAIL INVOICES IN ACROBAT FORMAT V Author’s Choice

It can be extremely difficult to obtain payment for some invoices. This problem
usually arises when the approval of a specific individual at a customer is required
and that person is either rarely available or so disorganized that the paperwork
invariably disappears. Traditional approaches have been to attempt routing an
invoice around the person in question, repeatedly mailing or faxing copies of it,
or e-mailing reminders at regular intervals. Despite the variety of possible
actions, this can become a frustrating impasse that may take months to resolve.

Of the approaches just noted, the one that works best is a reminder e-mail to
the approving party, because that person can simply forward the e-mail to the
accounting department with a note asking to expedite the payment. However, the
problem with e-mails is that a perfect copy of the invoice cannot be included with
the e-mail message, which could otherwise be forwarded straight to the accounting
department with an approval notation by the approving party. Another problem is
that the approving party may not have seen the invoice, and so may claim that he
or she cannot approve it.

Adobe’s Acrobat software has eliminated these problems by making it possi-
ble to create a perfect copy of an invoice as printed by any accounting system and
to save it into a PDF file that can be attached to an e-mail and forwarded straight
to a customer’s accounting department, where it can be opened, printed, and paid.
By using this approach, one can create a completely electronic methodology for
obtaining approval of invoices by customers.

Implementing the conversion of invoices into the Acrobat format is quite
simple. First go to the Adobe Web site (www.adobe.com) to order the Acrobat
software, and pay $249 either to download it or have a copy shipped to you. Once
received and installed the program, go to your accounting software package and
prepare to print an invoice. When the printing screen appears, change the
assigned printer to the Acrobat Distiller, which will appear as one of the available
printers. The software will ask you where you want to store the resulting file and
what to name it. After a few seconds, the conversion of the invoice into a picture-
perfect PDF file will be complete.

The resulting PDF file can be easily incorporated into an e-mail message as a
file attachment. However, do not assume that the recipient of the message has
Adobe’s Acrobat Reader software available to open and view the invoice file.
Instead, add a line in your e-mail message noting where the recipient can down-
load a free copy of the software. A sample message might read as follows:

Converting invoices to the PDF format can accelerate the receipt of cash
from customers, reduce the collection efforts of the accounting staff, and allow
customers to approve invoices electronically. This is a significant, inexpensive,
and operationally elegant way to accelerate cash flow.

TOTAL IMPACT OF BEST PRACTICES
ON THE COLLECTIONS FUNCTION

This section covers a group of collections best practices that, when used together,
will result in a very efficient collections department. The group does not include
all of the best practices covered in this chapter, for a small number are mutually
exclusive. In particular, outsourcing the collections function does not allow one
to implement many of the other best practices. Accordingly, it is assumed that
collections work is kept in-house, so a number of other improvements can be
implemented.

The recommended best practices are laid out in Exhibit 7.2 in order of the
typical transaction flow that results in a completed collection activity. It begins
with the sales department, which can reduce the amount of customer confusion
by simplifying the product pricing structure. It then moves on to the credit
department, which can preapprove customer credit and standardize the credit-
granting system, both of which result in consistent and reasonable customer
credit levels, keeping the collections staff from having to collect on excessive
sales amounts to customers who are not capable of paying. Finally, it reaches the
collections department, where there are many best practices that can make the
collections task more efficient: lockbox collections, immediate cash application,
unapproved write-offs of small balances, early payment discounts, stratified col-
lections, and automatic faxing of overdue invoices and dunning letters, as well as
automatic bankruptcy notifications. One can supplement these activities with
three databases (e.g., customer assets, customer orders, and collection calls) to
assist in making more effective collection calls. Nearly all of these changes can
be completed in a relatively short time, with only a few requiring significant
investments. Consequently, the activities shown in Exhibit 7.2 can all be imple-
mented in most companies, resulting in a profound difference in the level of effi-
ciency of the collections department.

Summary 153

SUMMARY

The job of collecting accounts receivable is a hard and thankless one. The person
who performs well in this position is the one who finds out why a customer pays
late and then works with other departments in the company to ensure that the cus-
tomer has fewer reasons for doing so in the future. This approach is embodied by
many of the best practices that were presented in this chapter, such as simplifying
the pricing structure, examining customer orders to see if there are any shipment
problems, and granting credit levels in advance, eliminating any last minute pres-
sure to grant an inappropriate level of credit that the customer can abuse. It is also
important for a good collections person to keep accounts receivable from becom-
ing overdue in the first place. Some of the best practices in this chapter address
this issue, such as granting early payment discount terms and immediately apply-
ing all cash as soon as it is received. Another part of the collections job is to per-
form collection calls as efficiently as possible; this task is addressed by other best
practices, such as using automated faxes of overdue invoices and dunning letters,
as well as a collection call database. Finally, the collections staff must use all pos-
sible pressure points to collect from customers, which it can do with the use of
such best practices as collection call stratification and a database of customer
assets. When all of these tools are properly utilized, a collections staff not only
can perform its job more efficiently, but can reduce significantly the amount of
overdue accounts receivable at the same time.

Commissions Best
Practices

The application of best practices to commissions hardly seems to be worth a sep-
arate chapter; however, there are a surprisingly large number of actions that can
streamline the calculation of commissions and their payment to sales personnel.
This chapter contains 10 best practices, and the main factor to keep in mind is
that they are designed to improve the operations of the accounting department only.
Though none of them will worsen the systems in the sales department, the other
area that is directly impacted, they may have an opposite impact on the morale of
that department. For example, one best practice is to replace convoluted commis-
sion structures with a simplified model. Though this will obviously lead to easier
commission calculations by the accounting staff, it may also have the negative
impact of reducing the sales incentive for those salespeople who are no longer
receiving such a good compensation package. Accordingly, before installing any of
the following best practices, it is a good idea to first gain the approval of the sales
manager to any changes that will directly or indirectly impact the sales department.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES FOR COMMISSIONS BEST PRACTICES

This section illustrates the relative degree of implementation cost and duration for
commission best practices, as displayed in Exhibit 8.1. The level of implementation
difficulty in this area is quite polarized because of one major issue— some of the rec-
ommended changes require the complete cooperation of the sales manager, who will
probably actively resist at least a few of them. Accordingly, the duration of imple-
mentation for these best practices is rated as difficult and long, though they are actu-
ally quite simple if the agreement of the sales manager can somehow be obtained in
advance. An example of this problem is simplifying the commission structure.
Those best practices that can be completed by the accounting staff without
any outside approval are rated as both inexpensive and short installations. An
example of such a best practice is paying commissions through the traditional
payroll system. The only exceptions to the easy internal accounting changes are
two items that may require some expensive programming assistance. Thus, the
range of implementation difficulty is extraordinarily wide in this functional area.

8-1 AUTOMATICALLY CALCULATE COMMISSIONS
IN THE COMPUTER SYSTEM

For many commission clerks, the days when commissions are calculated are not
pleasant. Every invoice from the previous month must be assembled and
reviewed, with notations on each one regarding which salesperson is paid a com-
mission, the extent of any split commissions, and their amounts. Further, given
the volume of invoices and the complexity of calculations, there is almost cer-
tainly an error every month, so the sales staff will be sure to pay a visit as soon as
the commission checks are released in order to complain about their payments.
This results in additional changes to the payments, making them very difficult to


156 Commissions Best Practices

audit, in case the controller or the internal audit manager wants to verify that
commissions are being calculated correctly. The manual nature of the work
makes it both tedious and highly prone to error.

The answer is to automate as much of it as possible by having the computer
system do the calculating. This way, the commission clerk only has to scan
through the list of invoices assigned to each salesperson and verify that each has
the correct salesperson’s name listed on it and the correct commission rate
charged to it. To make this system work, there must be a provision in the account-
ing software to record salesperson names and commission rates against invoices,
a very common feature on even the most inexpensive systems—though if it does
not exist, an expensive piece of programming work must be completed before
this best practice can be implemented. Then the accounting staff must alter its
invoicing procedure so that it enters a salesperson’s name, initials, or identifying
number in the invoicing record for every new invoice. It is very helpful if the
data-entry screen is altered to require this field to be entered, in order to avoid
any missing commissions. Once this procedure is altered, it is an easy matter to
run a commissions report at the end of the reporting period and then pay commis-
sion checks from it. This is a simple and effective way to eliminate the manual
labor and errors associated with the calculation of commissions.

The main problem with using automated commission calculations is that it
does not work if the commission system is a complex one. For example, the typi-
cal computer system only allows for a single commission rate and salesperson to
be assigned to each invoice. However, many companies have highly varied and
detailed commission systems, where the commission rates vary based on a vari-
ety of factors and many invoices have split commissions assigned to several sales
staff. In these cases, only custom programming or a return to manual commission
calculations will be possible, unless someone can convince the sales manager to
adopt a simplified commission structure. This is rarely possible since the sales
manager is the one who probably created the complicated system and has no
intention of seeing it dismantled.

8-2 CALCULATE FINAL COMMISSIONS FROM ACTUAL DATA

A common arrangement for departing salespeople is that they are paid immediately
for the commissions they have not yet received, but which they should receive in
the next commission payment. Unfortunately, the amount of this commission pay-
ment is frequently a guess, since some sales have not yet been completed and
orders have not even been received for other potential sales on which a salesperson
may have been working for many months. Accordingly, there is usually a compli-
cated formula in the typical salesperson’s hiring agreement that pays out a full
commission on completed sales, a partial one on orders just received, and perhaps


8-3 Construct a Standard Commission Terms Table 157

even a small allowance on expected sales for which final orders have not yet been
received. The work required to complete this formula is highly labor-intensive
and frequently inaccurate, especially if an allowance is paid for sales which may
not yet have occurred (and which may never occur).

A better approach is to restructure the initial sales agreement to state that
commissions will be paid at the regular times after employee termination until all
sales have been recorded. The duration of these payments may be several months,
which means that the salesperson must wait some time to receive full compensa-
tion, but the accounting staff benefits from not having to waste time on a separate,
and highly laborious, termination calculation. Instead, they take no notice of
whether a salesperson is still working for the company and just calculate and pay
out commissions in accordance with regular procedures.

There are three problems with this approach. One is that if the commission
calculation is made automatically in the computer system, sales will probably be
assigned to a new salesperson as soon as the old one has left, requiring some man-
ual tracking of exactly who is entitled to payment on which sale during the transi-
tion period. The second problem is that if a salesperson is fired, most state laws
require immediate compensation within a day or so of termination. Though the
initial sales agreement can be modified to cover this contingency, one should first
check to see if the applicable state law will override the sales agreement. Finally,
this type of payout usually requires a change to the initial employee contract with
each salesperson; the existing sales staff may have a problem with this new
arrangement since they will not receive payment so quickly if they leave the com-
pany. A company can take the chance of irritating the existing sales staff by unilat-
erally changing the agreements, but may want to try the more politically correct
approach of grandfathering the existing staff and only apply the new agreement to
new sales employees. In short, delaying the final commission payment runs the
risk of mixing up payments between old and new salespeople, may be contrary to
state laws, and may only be applicable to new employees. Despite these issues, it
is still a good idea to implement this best practice, even though it may be several
years before it applies to all of the sales staff.

8-3 CONSTRUCT A STANDARD COMMISSION
TERMS TABLE WV Author’s Choice

As salespeople may make the majority of their incomes from commissions, they
have a great deal of interest in the exact rates paid on various kinds of sales. This can
lead to many visits to the commissions clerk to complain about perceived problems
with the rates paid on various invoices. Not only can this be a stressful visit on the
part of the commissions clerk, who will be on the receiving end of some very force-
ful arguments, but it is also a waste of time, since that person has other work to do
besides listening to the arguments of the sales staff.


158 Commissions Best Practices

A reasonable approach that greatly reduces sales staff complaints is a com-
mission terms table. It should specify the exact commission arrangement with
each salesperson so that there is absolutely no way to misconstrue the reimburse-
ment arrangement. Once this is set up, it can be distributed to the sales staff, who
can refer to it instead of the commissions clerk. There will be the inevitable rash
of complaints for the first few days after the table is issued since the sales staff
will want clarification on a few key points, possibly requiring a reissuance of the
table. However, once the table has been reviewed a few times, the number of
complaints should rapidly dwindle. The only problem with this approach is that
listing the commission deals of all the sales staff side-by-side on a single docu-
ment will lead to a great deal of analysis and arguing by those sales personnel
who think they are not receiving as good a commission arrangement. The best
way to avoid this problem is to separate the table into pieces so each salesperson
only sees that piece of it that applies to the individual. By following this
approach, the number of inquiries and commission adjustments that the account-
ing staff must deal with will rapidly decline

Cost: SS Installation time:

8-4 PERIODICALLY ISSUE A SUMMARY OF COMMISSION RATES

Even companies with a simplified and easily understandable commission struc-
ture will sometimes have difficulty communicating this information to the sales
staffs. The problem is that the information is not readily available for sales per-
sonnel to see, and so they are always breeding rumors about commission alter-
ations impacting their income. This causes a continuing morale problem, fre-
quently resulting in needless inquiries to the accounting department.

The simple solution to this problem is to periodically issue a summary of
commission rates. If management is comfortable with revealing the entire com-
mission structure for all personnel, it can issue a commission table to the entire
sales force. If not, it can issue a salesperson-specific commission listing. The
table should be issued no less frequently than annually. A good way to present the
commission information to a salesperson is to include it in the annual review,
allowing each salesperson time to review it and ask questions about it. Also, the
commissions table should be reissued and discussed with the sales force every
time there is a change in the table, which keeps the accounting staff from having
to explain the changes after the fact when the sales staff calls to inquire about the
alterations. In short, up-front communications with the sales staff is a good way
to keep the accounting department from having to answer inquiries about the
commission information.

8-5 SIMPLIFY THE COMMISSION STRUCTURE V Author's Choice

The bane of the accounting department is an overly complex commission struc-
ture. When there are a multitude of commission rates, shared rates, special
bonuses, and retroactive booster clauses, the commission calculation chore is
mind-numbing and highly subject to error, which causes further analysis to fix.
An example of such a system, based on an actual corporation, is for a company-
wide standard commission rate, but with special increased commission rates
for certain counties considered especially difficult regions in which to sell,
except for sales to certain customers, which are the responsibility of the in-
house sales staff, who receive a different commission rate. In addition, the
commission rate is retroactively increased if later quarterly sales targets are
met, and are retroactively increased a second time if the full-year sales goal is
reached, with an extra bonus payment if the full-year goal is exceeded by a set
percentage. Needless to say, this company went through an endless cycle of
commission payment adjustments, some of which were disputed for months
afterwards. Also, this company had great difficulty retaining a commissions
clerk in the accounting department.

The best practice that resolves this problem is a simplification of the overall
commission structure. For example, the previous example can be reduced to a
single across-the-board commission rate, with quarterly and annual bonuses if
milestone targets are reached. Though an obvious solution and one that can
greatly reduce the work of the accounting staff, it is only implemented with the
greatest difficulty because the sales manager must approve the new system, and
rarely does so. The reason is that the sales manager probably created the convo-
luted commissions system in the first place and feels that it is a good one for
motivating the sales staff. In this situation, the matter may have to go to a higher
authority for approval, though this irritates the sales manager. A better and more
politically correct variation is to persuade the sales manager to adopt a midway
solution that leaves both parties partially satisfied and still able to work with each
other on additional projects. In the long run, as new people move into the sales
manager position, there may still be opportunities to more completely simplify
the commission structure.

8-6 INCLUDE COMMISSION PAYMENTS IN
PAYROLL PAYMENTS

If a company has a significant number of sales personnel, the chore of issuing
commission payments to them can be a significant one. The taxes must be com-
piled for each check and deducted from the gross pay, the checks must be cut or a
wire transfer made, and, for those employees who are out of town, there may be


160 Commissions Best Practices

other special arrangements to get the money to them. Depending on the number
of checks, this can interfere with the smooth functioning of the accounting
department.

A simple but effective way to avoid this problem is to roll commission pay-
ments into the regular payroll processing system. By doing so, the payroll calcu-
lation chore is completely eliminated, once the gross commission amounts are
approved and sent to the payroll staff for processing. The system will calculate
taxes automatically, issue checks or direct deposits, or mail to employees,
depending on the distribution method the regular payroll system uses. This com-
pletely eliminates a major chore.

There are two problems with this best practice. One is that the commission
payment date may not coincide with the payroll processing date, which necessi-
tates a change in the commission payment date. For example, if the commission
is always paid on the fifteenth day of the month, but the payroll is on a biweekly
schedule, the actual pay date will certainly not fall on the fifteenth day of every
month. To fix this issue, the commission payment date in the example could be
set to the first payroll date following the fifteenth of the month. The other prob-
lem is that by combining a salesperson’s regular paycheck with the commission
payment, the combined total will put the employee into a higher pay bracket,
resulting in more taxes being deducted (never a popular outcome). This issue can
be resolved either by setting employee deduction rates lower or by separating the
payments into two separate checks in the payroll system in order to drop the
payee into a lower apparent tax bracket (though most payroll systems do not have
this feature). As long as these issues are taken into account, merging commis-
sions into the payroll system is a very effective way for the accounting staff to
avoid cutting separate commission checks.

8-7 LENGTHEN THE INTERVAL BETWEEN
COMMISSION PAYMENTS

Some commissions are paid as frequently as once a week, though monthly pay-
ments are the norm in most industries. If there are many employees receiving
commission payments, this level of frequency results in a multitude of commis-
sion calculations and check payments over the course of a year.

It may be possible in some instances to lengthen the interval between com-
mission payments, reducing the amount of commission calculation and paycheck
preparation work for the accounting department. This best practice is only useful
in a minority of situations, however, because the commissions of many sales per-
sonnel constitute a large proportion of their pay and they cannot afford to wait a
long time to receive it. However, there are some instances where salespeople


8-8 Only Pay Commissions from Cash Received 161

receive only a very small proportion of their pay in the form of commissions. In
this situation, it makes little sense to calculate a commission for a very small
amount of money and is better to only do it at a longer interval, perhaps quarterly
or annually. Though it can be used only in a few cases, this best practice is worth
considering.

Cost: SS Installation time:

8-8 ONLY PAY COMMISSIONS FROM CASH RECEIVED

A major problem for the collections staff is salespeople who indiscriminately sell
any amount of product or service to customers, regardless of the ability of those
customers to pay. When this happens, the salesperson is focusing only on the
commission that will result from the sale and not on the excessive work required
of the collections staff to bring in the payment from the supplier, not to mention
the much higher bad debt allowance needed to offset uncollectible accounts.

The best practice that avoids this difficulty is to change the commission sys-
tem so that salespeople are paid a commission only on the cash received from
customers. This change will instantly turn the entire sales force into a secondary
collection agency, since they will be very interested in bringing in cash on time.
They will also be more concerned about the creditworthiness of their customers,
since they will spend less time selling to customers that have little realistic
chance of paying.

There are a few problems that make this a tough best practice to adopt. First,
as it requires salespeople to wait longer before they are paid a commission, they
are markedly unwilling to change to this new system. Second, the amount they
are paid will be somewhat smaller than what they are used to receiving, since
inevitably there will be a few accounts receivable that will never be collected.
Third, because of the first two issues, some of the sales staff will feel slighted and
will probably leave the company to find another organization with a more favor-
able commission arrangement. Accordingly, the sales manager may not support a
change to this kind of commission structure.

A problem directly related to the accounting systems (and not the intransi-
gence of the sales department!) is that since commissions are now paid based on
cash received, there must be a cash report to show the amounts of cash received
from each customer in a given time period, in order to calculate commissions from
this information. Alternatively, if commissions are based on cash received from
specific invoices, the report must reflect this information. Most accounting systems
already contain this report; if not, it must be programmed into the system.

8-9 PERIODICALLY AUDIT COMMISSIONS PAID

Given the complexity of some commission structures, it comes as no surprise that
the sales staff is not always paid the correct commission amount. This is particularly
true of transition periods, where payment rates change or new salespeople take over
different sales territories. When this happens, there is confusion regarding the cor-
rect commission rates to pay on certain invoices or who to pay for each one. The
usual result is that there are some overpayments that go uncorrected; the sales staff
will closely peruse commission payments to make sure that underpayments do not
occur, so this is rarely a problem. In addition, there is a chance that overpayments
are made on a regular basis, since any continuing overpayment is unlikely to be
reported by the salesperson on the receiving end of this largesse.

The best way to review commissions for this problem is to schedule a periodic
internal audit of the commission calculations. This review can take the form of a
detailed analysis of a sampling of commission payments or a much simpler overall
review of the percentage of commissions paid out, with a more detailed review if
the percentage looks excessively high. Any problems discovered through this
process can result in some retraining of the commissions clerk, an adjustment in the
commission rates paid, or a reduction in the future payments to the sales staff until
any overpayments have been fully deducted from their pay. This approach requires
some time on the part of the internal audit staff, but does not need to be conducted
very frequently and so is not an expensive proposition. An occasional review is usu-
ally sufficient to find and correct any problems with commission overpayments.

8-10 INSTALL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION
MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

Commission tracking for a large number of salespeople is an exceedingly com-
plex chore, especially when there are multiple sales plans with a variety of splits,
bonuses, overrides, caps, hurdles, guaranteed payments, and commission rates. This
task typically requires a massive amount of accounting staff time spent manipulating
electronic spreadsheets, and is highly error-prone. Most of the other best practices in
this chapter are designed to simplify the commission calculation structure in order to
reduce the amount of accounting effort. However, an automated alternative is
available that allows the sales manager to retain a high degree of commission plan
complexity while minimizing the manual calculation labor of the accounting staff.
The solution is to install incentive compensation management software, such
as that offered by Centiv, Synygy, and Callidus Software. It is a separate package
from the accounting software, and requires a custom data feed from the accounting
database, using the incoming data to build complex data-tracking models that churn
out exactly what each salesperson is to be paid, along with a commission statement.


8-11 Post Commission Payments on the Company Intranet 163

The best packages also allow for the “what if” modeling of different commission
plan scenarios, as well as the construction of customized commission plans that
are precisely tailored to a company’s needs, and can also deliver commission
results to salespeople over the Internet. The trouble with this best practice is its
cost. The software is expensive and requires consulting labor to develop a data
link between the main accounting database and the new software; thus, it is only a
cost-effective solution for those organizations with at least 100 salespeople.

8-11 POST COMMISSION PAYMENTS ON
THE COMPANY INTRANET

A sales staff whose pay structure is heavily skewed in favor of commission pay-
ments, rather than salaries, will probably hound the accounting staff at month-end to
see what their commission payments will be. This comes at the time of the month
when the accounting staff is trying to close the accounting books, and so increases
their workload at the worst possible time of the month. However, by creating a link-
age between the accounting database and a company’s intranet site, it is now possi-
ble to shift this information directly to the Web page where the sales staff can view it
at any time, and without involving the valuable time of the accounting staff.

There are two ways to post the commission information. One is to wait until
all commission-related calculations have been completed at month-end, and then
either manually dump the data into an HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
format for posting to a Web page or else run a batch program that does so auto-
matically. Either approach will give the sales staff a complete set of information
about their commissions. However, this approach still requires some manual
effort at month-end (even if only for a few minutes while a batch program runs).

An alternative approach is to create a direct interface between the accounting
database and the Web page, so that commissions are updated constantly, includ-
ing grand totals for each commission payment period. By using this approach,
the accounting staff has virtually no work to do in conveying information to the
sales staff. In addition, sales personnel can check their commissions at any time
of the month, and call the accounting staff with their concerns right away —this is
a great improvement, since problems can be spotted and fixed at once, rather than
waiting until the crucial month-end closing period to correct them.

No matter which method is used for posting commission information, a
password system will be needed, since this is highly personal payroll-related
information. There should be a reminder program built into the system, so that
the sales staff is forced to alter their passwords on a regular basis, thereby reduc-
ing the risk of outside access to this information.

8-12 SHOW POTENTIAL COMMISSIONS ON CASH REGISTER

The sales manager can have difficulty in motivating the sales staff to sell those
products with the highest margins. This is a particularly galling issue when there
are so many products on hand it is almost impossible to educate the staff about
margins on each one. Consequently, the sales staff sells whatever customers ask
for, rather than attempting to steer them in the direction of more profitable prod-
ucts, resulting in less-than-optimal corporate profitability.

A rarely used best practice is to itemize the commission rates salespeople
earn on individual products right on the cash register. When combined with a list-
ing of the commissions on a range of related products, the sales staff can quickly
scan the data, identify those that will make them the most money, and steer cus-
tomers toward them. Since the products with the highest commissions will pre-
sumably have the highest margins, this practice should result in higher company
margins. The tool can also be used to emphasize sales on products the company is
discontinuing and wishes to clear out of stock. Thus, by bring detailed informa-
tion to the sales staff which is also tied to sales incentives, a company can
increase its margins while also better managing its mix of on-hand products.

One problem with listing commissions on cash registers is that this approach
is only useable in a retail environment where salespeople ring up sales on the spot.
It would not be functional at all, for example, if a salesperson conducts multiple
sales calls on the road, though the concept can be modified by loading commission
rates by product into a laptop computer, which the salesperson can consult during
sales calls. Given the cost of a computer, however, this can be an expensive option.
Another issue is that the commission database will be a very complicated one,
especially if commissions on products are changed frequently, necessitating a list-
ing of commissions by both product and date. This can be a major programming
job, requiring significant computer resources. Finally, the cash registers must
include video display terminals of a sufficient size to show multiple products and
their commissions—if such terminals do not exist, all retail locations using the
system must be equipped with them, a significant extra expense. If these problems
can be overcome, however, the posting of product commissions on cash registers
can lead to a major improvement in corporate profitability.

vast majority of these best practices are centered on the calculation of commis-

sales manager is required for several of these items, the end result— standardized

commissions that are regularly audited, automatically calculated, and only paid
from actual cash receipts—reduces the work of the accounting staff to a remark-
able degree. Those best practices affecting the payment of commissions have a
much smaller impact on accounting efficiency, while the one item affecting the
motivation of the sales staff does nothing to improve the accounting department.
Accordingly, the bulk of management attention in this area should go to improving
the efficiency of calculating commissions.

SUMMARY

This chapter concentrated primarily on ways to reduce the time, effort, and number
of errors in the calculation of commissions, with a reduced emphasis on better ways
to pay commissions once they have been calculated. They are mostly easy best
practices to implement. However, as noted several times in this chapter, several of
them will directly affect the sales staff and so require the approval of the sales
manager before they can be implemented. Since some of these changes will not
be popular with the salespeople, do not be surprised if that approval is not forth-
coming. If so, an occasional review of unapproved best practices may eventually
find a more malleable sales manager in place, with a different result. Thus, if at
first you don’t succeed, try, try again.

Costing Best Practices

This chapter is concerned with those best practices impacting the cost of products
and the valuation of inventory. They are grouped into three main areas: informa-
tion accuracy, cost reports, and costing systems. The first category, information
accuracy, covers several best practices that review the accuracy of key informa-
tion driving the costing of inventory: bills of material, labor routings, and units of
measure. The second category, cost reports, is covered by the largest number of
best practices. These are concerned with modifying or even eliminating the cur-
rent cost-reporting systems in favor of a tighter focus on direct costs, materials,
costs trends, and obsolete inventory. The final category, costing systems,
addresses the two costing systems that should at least supplement, if not replace,
traditional costing systems: activity-based costing and target costing. When the
complete set of best practices advocated in this chapter has been implemented, a
company will find that it has a much better grasp of its key product costs and how
to control them.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES FOR COSTING BEST PRACTICES

This section covers the general level of implementation cost and duration for each
of the best practices discussed later in this chapter. Each best practice is noted in
Exhibit 9.1, along with a rating of the cost and duration of implementation for
each one. Generally speaking, these are easy best practices to install because
most of them can be completed with no other approval than the controller’s, and
they have a short implementation duration and are quite inexpensive to install
and operate. The main exceptions are target costing and activity-based costing,
which require a major commitment of time and staff and the approval of other
department managers, depending on their levels of involvement in the imple-
mentations. However, despite the level of installation difficulty for these two
best practices, they both have the most significant positive impact of all the
improvements noted in this chapter and thus are well worth the effort.

There are also several cost-reporting changes advocated in this chapter.
Though the reports are not hard to alter or replace, it can be quite another matter
to convince the report recipients that they are now receiving better information,
especially if they are old-line managers who have received the same cost reports
for decades. Consequently, the time required to insert a new cost report into a

9-1 AUDIT BILLS OF MATERIAL V Author’s Choice

When the accounting department issues financial statements, one of the largest
expenses listed on it is the material cost (at least in a manufacturing environ-
ment). Unless they conduct a monthly physical inventory count, the account-
ing staff must rely on the word of the logistics department in assuming that
the month-end inventory listed on the books is the correct amount. If it is not,
the financial statements can be off by a significant amount. The core document
used by the logistics department that drives the accuracy of the inventory
is the bill of materials. This is a listing of the components that go into a prod-
uct. If it is incorrect, the parts assumed to be in a product will be incorrect,
which means that products costs will be wrong, too. This problem has the
greatest impact in a backflushing environment, where the bills of material
determine how many materials are used to produce a product. Thus, the accu-
racy of the bills of material have a major impact on the accuracy of the finan-
cial statements.


9-2 Audit Labor Routings 169

The best practice that improves the situation is following an ongoing pro-
gram of auditing bills of material. By doing so, errors are flushed out of the bills,
resulting in better inventory quantity data, which in turn results in more accurate
financial statements. The best way to implement bill audits is to tie them to the
production schedule, so that any products scheduled to be manufactured in the
near future are reviewed the most frequently. This focuses attention on those bills
with the highest usage, though it is still necessary to review the bills of less fre-
quently used products from time to time. The review can be conducted by the
engineering staff, the production scheduler, the warehouse staff, and the produc-
tion staff. The reason for using so many people is that they all have input into the
process. The engineering staff has the best overall knowledge of the product,
while the production scheduler is the most aware of production shortages caused
by problems with the bills, and the warehouse staff sees components returned to
the warehouse that were listed in the bills but not actually used; the production
staff must assemble products and knows from practical experience which bills are
inaccurate. Thus, a variety of people (preferably all of them) can influence the bill
of material review process.

Measuring a bill of material includes several steps. One is to ensure that the
correct part quantities are listed. Another is to verify that parts should be included
in the product at all. Yet another is that the correct subassemblies roll up into the
final product. If any of these items are incorrect, a bill of material should be listed
as incorrect in total. For a large bill with many components, this means that it will
almost certainly be listed as incorrect when it is first reviewed, with rapid
improvement as corrections are made. The target that a company should shoot for
when reviewing bills of material is a minimum accuracy level of 98 percent. At
this level, any errors will have a minimal impact on accuracy, cost of the inven-
tory, and cost of goods sold. Thus, it is not uncommon for a company to record an
initial overall bill of material accuracy of zero.

If a controller can effectively work with the engineering, production, and
logistics staffs to create a reliable bill of material review system, the result is a
much more accurate costing system.

9-2 AUDIT LABOR ROUTINGS

The labor a company charges to each of its products is derived from a labor rout-
ing, which is an engineering estimate of the labor hours required to produce a
product. Unfortunately, an inaccuracy in the labor-routing information has a
major impact on a company’s profitability for two reasons. One is that the labor
hours assigned to a product will be incorrect, resulting in an incorrect product
cost. By itself, this is not usually a major problem, because the labor cost is not a
large component of the total product cost. However, the second reason is the real


170 Costing Best Practices

problem — since the labor rate is frequently used as the primary basis upon which
overhead is allocated to products, a shift in the labor rate can result in a massive
change in the allocated overhead cost, which may be much larger than the under-
lying labor cost. Thus, an inaccurate labor routing can have a major impact on the
reported cost of a product.

The best practice that addresses this problem is auditing labor routings. By
doing so, one can gradually review all labor records and verify their accuracy,
thereby avoiding any miscosting of products. To do so, one must enlist the help of
the engineering manager, who must assign a staff person to review this informa-
tion on a regular basis and make changes as needed. The accounting department
can assist in the effort by comparing the labor routings of similar products to see
if there are any discrepancies and bring them to the attention of the engineering
department for resolution. Also, it can review computer records (if they exist) to
see when labor routings have been changed and verify the alterations with the
engineering staff. Finally, the accounting staff can work with the production plan-
ning department to see if the assumed production-run quantities noted in the
labor routings match actual production quantities. This last item is a critical one,
for the assumed per-unit labor quantity will go down as the run length increases,
due to the improved learning curve that comes with longer production runs, as
well as the larger number of production units over which the labor setup time can
be spread. Some unscrupulous businesspeople will assume very short production
runs in order to increase the assumed labor rates in their labor routings, resulting
in the capitalization of much higher labor and overhead costs in the inventory
records. Thus, a continual review and comparison of labor-routing records by the
accounting staff is a necessary component of this auditing process.

9-3 ELIMINATE HIGH-LEVERAGE OVERHEAD
ALLOCATION BASES

There is nothing more damaging to a company than to make a management deci-
sion based on inaccurate information. Though the accounting department is
devoted to presenting the best possible information to senior management at all
times, there is one area in which it continues to provide inaccurate data: overhead
costs. This is an increasingly large proportion of the costs of many companies,
and it is critical to allocate it to various activities and products properly. To be
blunt, most accountants do a very poor job of allocating these costs, resulting in
cost reports that show inordinately high or low overhead costs being assigned to
various items. When a manager acts upon this information, the decision may be a
wrong one because the overhead cost component of the information was wrong.
The reason why overhead costing information is incorrect in so many instances is
a faulty allocation base. For example, the most common allocation base is to


9-4 Eliminate Labor Variance Reporting 171

assign overhead costs to a product based on the amount of labor cost used to build
it. The trouble is that labor is an increasingly small component of total labor costs,
resulting in large overhead amounts being allocated based on tiny labor costs. The
ratio of overhead to labor costs can reach absurd levels, such as $10 for every $1
of labor. When there are large differences between the proportion of overhead to
the allocation base, even a slight change in the allocation base will result in a large
swing in the overhead costs. Thus, minute month-to-month differences in the allo-
cation base can falsely alter product costs by significant amounts.

The best practice that resolves this problem is to find new allocation bases
that are not so highly leveraged. By doing so, there is less chance of having
unusual cost swings based on small alterations in the allocation base. A good rule
of thumb is to keep the ratio of allocation base to overhead cost no higher than
one to one and preferably much less. This way, small changes in the allocation
base will result in similarly small changes in the overhead cost. If the allocation
base is not monetary, use an allocation base that is so large that any large changes
are unlikely. For example, if square footage is used as the allocation base, the
chance that the amount of square footage will suddenly change by an inordinate
amount is quite small. In either case, the goal of reducing wide swings in over-
head costs has been achieved.

This is a simple best practice to implement, usually requiring a modest
investment in investigation time in order to find new allocation bases to replace
the existing ones, as well as a few days of work to set up the allocation formulas.
Since there is little or no programming required, and the approval of other depart-
ments is unnecessary, there is no reason why this implementation cannot succeed
in short order.

This best practice addresses the problem of keeping overhead costs from
changing significantly. Another best practice reviews the problem from a different
angle, which is linking overhead costs to specific activities as tightly as possible,
resulting in a more informed allocation of costs to those activities that drive the costs.
For more information on this approach to overhead allocation, see the “Implement
Activity-Based Costing” section later in this chapter.

9-4 ELIMINATE LABOR VARIANCE REPORTING WV Author’s Choice

The cost components of work-in-process and inventory goods will inevitably include
some labor. However, the proportion of labor in the total cost mix has dropped
markedly over the years, with material and overhead costs now predominating.
Nonetheless, the costing reports the accounting staff has traditionally generated are
mostly concerned with labor. Examples of these reports are those detailing over-
time, comparing actual to standard labor rates or usage, and labor efficiency. By
comparison, the reports concerned with the materials expense typically cover only


172 Costing Best Practices

scrap rates and purchase price variances, while many companies have no reporting
for overhead costs at all. Hence, most accounting departments are misallocating
their time in reporting on the smallest component of product costs.

The best practice that addresses this problem is one of the easiest to imple-
ment—simply stop reporting on labor variances. The accounting staff will have
more time to spend on reports concerning costs that make up a larger proportion of
product costs. The problem with this best practice is the remarkable uproar it fre-
quently incites, especially on the part of traditional production managers who were
raised on the concept of tight control over labor costs. Thus, the best way to imple-
ment this item is to carefully educate the production staff on the following points:

¢ Direct labor is really a fixed cost. In many manufacturing situations, the direct
labor staff cannot be sent home the moment there is no work left to do. Instead,
a company must think about retaining them since they are trained and more
efficient than other people who might be brought in off the street. Accordingly,
it makes a great deal of sense to guarantee regular working hours to the direct
labor staff (within reason). By doing so, it becomes apparent that direct labor
is not a variable cost at all and requires much less detailed investigation and
reporting work for the accounting staff.

* Other reports are more valuable. If the accounting department only has enough
resources to issue a fixed number of reports, there is a good argument for elimi-
nating the least useful ones (labor reporting) in favor of ones involving more
costs, such as materials and overhead. One can reinforce this argument by for-
mulating trial report layouts for new reports that will replace the labor reports.

¢ Target costing is the real area of concern. Many studies have shown that
costs are not that variable once a product design is released to the factory
floor. Instead, the primary area in which costs can truly be impacted is during
the product design (see the ‘‘Implement Target Costing” section later in this
chapter). A strong argument in this area, especially if combined with visits to
other companies that have installed target costing, will go a long way toward
convincing management on this point.

If production management can be convinced that these three points are accurate,
it becomes much easier to eliminate labor variance reporting, either completely
or in part.

The only situation in which this best practice should not be implemented is
one where labor costs still make up the majority of product costs (an increasingly
rare situation) and where those costs are variable. If labor costs are highly fixed
in nature, there is not much point in continuing to issue reports showing that the
costs have not changed from period to period.

9-5 Follow a Schedule of Inventory Obsolescence Reviews 173

9-5 FOLLOW A SCHEDULE OF INVENTORY
OBSOLESCENCE REVIEWS WV Author’s Choice

A great many companies find that the proportion of their inventory that is obso-
lete is much higher than expected. This is a major problem at the end of the fiscal
year, when this type of inventory is supposed to be investigated and written off,
usually in conjunction with the auditor’s review or the physical inventory (or
both). If this write-off has not occurred in previous years, the cumulative amount
can be quite startling. This may result in the departure of the controller, on the
grounds that he or she should have known about the problem.

The best practice that resolves this problem is adopting and sticking to a
schedule of regular obsolete-inventory reviews. This is an unpopular task with
many employees because they must pore over usage reports and wander through
the warehouse to see what inventory is not needed and then follow up on disposal
problems. However, these people do not realize the major benefits of having a
periodic obsolete-inventory review. One is that it clears space out of the ware-
house, which may even allow for a reduction in the space this department needs,
resulting in a possible reduction in the overall square footage that a corporation
requires. Also, spotting obsolete inventory as early as possible allows a company
to realize the best salvage value for it, which will inevitably decline over time
(unless a company is dealing in antiques!). Further, a close review of the reason
why an inventory item is in stock and obsolete may lead to discoveries concern-
ing how parts are ordered and used; changing these practices may lead to a reduc-
tion in obsolete inventory in the future. Thus, there are a number of excellent rea-
sons for maintaining an ongoing obsolete-inventory review system.

The composition of the obsolete-inventory review committee is very impor-
tant. There should be an accountant who can summarize the costs of obsoles-
cence, while an engineering representative is in the best position to determine if a
part can be used elsewhere. Also, someone from the purchasing department can
tell if there is any resale value. Consequently, a cross-departmental committee is
needed to properly review obsolete inventory.

The main contribution of the accounting department to this review is a peri-
odic report that itemizes those parts most likely to be obsolete. This information
can take the following forms:

¢ Last usage date. Many computer systems record the last date on which a spe-
cific part number was removed from the warehouse for production or sale. If
So, it is an easy matter to use a report writer to extract and sort this informa-
tion, resulting in a report that lists all inventory, starting with those products
with the oldest “‘last used” date.

¢ No “where used” in the system. If a computer system includes a bill of
materials, there is a strong likelihood that it also generates a ‘where used”
report, which lists all of the bills of material for which an inventory item is


174 Costing Best Practices

used. If there is no ‘‘where used” listed on the report, it is likely that a part
is no longer needed. This report is most effective if bills of material are
removed from the computer system as soon as products are withdrawn
from the market; this more clearly reveals those inventory items that are no
longer needed. This approach can also be used to determine which inven-
tory is going to be obsolete, based on the anticipated withdrawal of existing
products from the market.

* Comparison to previous-year physical inventory tags. Many companies still
conduct a physical inventory at the end of their fiscal years. When this is
done, a tag is usually taped to each inventory item. Later, a member of the
accounting staff can walk through the warehouse and mark down all inven-
tory items with an inventory tag still attached to them. This is a simple visual
approach for finding old inventory.

¢ Acknowledged obsolete inventory still in the system. Even the best inventory
review committee will sometimes let obsolete inventory fall through the
cracks and remain in both the warehouse and the inventory database. The
accounting staff should keep track of all acknowledged obsolete inventory
and continue to notify management of those items that have not yet been
removed.

Any or all of these reports can be used to gain a knowledge of likely candi-
dates for obsolete-inventory status. This information is the mandatory first step in
the process of keeping the inventory up-to-date. Consequently, the accounting
staff plays a major role in this process.

9-6 IMPLEMENT ACTIVITY-BASED COSTING

The vast majority of companies only accumulate and report on costs by depart-
ment and product. The first method is tied to responsibility accounting, whereby
the costs of the specific department are tied to the performance bonus of its man-
ager. The second method assumes that the cost of overhead— mostly made up of
those departmental costs noted in the first method—is assigned to products based
on the amount of labor they accumulate. The problem with this approach is that
the two methods should be combined so that all company costs, to the greatest
extent possible, are tied to the actual cost required to produce a product. Without
this information, a company is doomed to make incorrect decisions related to the
correct pricing of products, or even if they should be continued or discontinued.
The same problem applies to determining the cost or profit associated with each
customer. Again, a company can work incorrectly to increase its business with a


9-6 Implement Activity-Based Costing 175

“high maintenance” customer that results in much lower overall profits, while
abandoning other customers that are really much more profitable. Poor costing
methodologies are at the bottom of many bad corporate decisions.

The solution to this problem is a system called activity-based costing. Under
this approach, a company summarizes all of its costs into a number of cost pools,
then allocates the expenses in those pools to a variety of activities, using a large
number of allocation measures. It becomes much easier to accurately assign the
costs of these activities to various products and customers, based on their usage
of the activities. Though this may seem like nothing more than an elaborate allo-
cation of overhead, it is actually a carefully constructed methodology for deter-
mining the true cost of a company’s products and services. Along with target
costing, it is the most significant advance in costing methodologies in the last few
decades, eminently worth the effort of putting in place.

However, installing an activity-based costing system is not that easy. The
cost pools must be constructed, allocation measures determined, and new sys-
tems created to store, calculate, and report all of this information. In addition, the
cooperation of other departments is necessary to ensure that new allocation mea-
sures are properly and consistently calculated. Finally, management must be
apprised of the content of the new reports that will come out of this system and
how they can be used. Given the considerable cost, time, and training required to
ensure that this system becomes fully operational and accepted by management,
it is no surprise that many such installations have not been completed, and even
completed ones do not enjoy the full support of upper management. Thus, it is
not so strange that activity-based costing is the best cost-accounting tool avail-
able and yet does not enjoy universal popularity or usage.

From the perspective of the accounting department, installing this system is
a difficult chore. Depending on the size of the company, one or more staff people
should be allocated to the project full-time for many months. In addition, the
existing accounting software almost certainly does not track activity-based costs;
a secondary software package must be purchased that takes information from the
general ledger, as well as allocation bases from a variety of locations, summa-
rizes data into cost pools, allocates it to activities, and charges costs to products.
Also, given the newness of this approach and the lack of instruction about it at the
college level, the services of a consultant may be worth the added cost. Further, a
considerable amount of management time must go into planning and controlling
the work effort, so that it is completed on time without exceeding the budgeted
expenditure level.

9-7 IMPLEMENT TARGET COSTING

A cost accounting staff can create the best costing reports in the world, constantly
update this information, and hound the production, engineering, and purchasing
staffs incessantly to improve the situation, and find little change in product costs.
The reason is that most product costs are locked in when the product is designed.
For example, a poor microwave oven design will lead to production inefficiencies
because the product was not designed for ease of manufacturability. Similarly, if
the oven was not designed to be sufficiently sturdy, there will be a number of cus-
tomer returns, resulting in added engineering and manufacturing costs to fix the
problem. Further, the oven may contain nonstandard parts that are both difficult
and expensive to obtain and that may not allow for the use of existing parts used
with other products. Thus, cost accounting is focusing on the wrong target—
product costs during production, instead of product costs during the design stage.

The best practice that addresses this issue is called target costing. Under this
concept, the existing market is reviewed and a target price is determined at which
a certain set of product specifications will probably sell quite well. A design team
is then brought together and assigned the task of creating a product with those
specifications and a maximum cost. The maximum cost figure allows a company
to sell for the previously determined price while still making an acceptable profit.
If it is impossible to produce the product for the maximum assigned cost, the pro-
ject is abandoned. This approach is in contrast to the more traditional method of
designing a product, determining how much it costs when the project is finished,
and then adding on a profit percentage to arrive at a selling price.

The obvious advantage of target costing is that a company has total control
over product costs before any product reaches the production floor. It is easy to
determine which products should be produced and which ones abandoned,
thereby keeping losing or marginally profitable products out of a company’s
product mix. From the accounting department’s perspective, its costing work
shifts away from tracking production costs and into tracking costs during the
design phase. This means that a cost accountant should be reassigned from the
first activity to the latter so that there is a daily review of the range of costs into
which target costs are likely to fall. By shifting the direction of the accounting
department’s costing analysis, one can report on the activities which truly have
the greatest impact on product costs.

9-8 LIMIT ACCESS TO UNIT OF MEASURE CHANGES

The unit of measure field, an innocuous field in the computer system, can have a
major impact on the accuracy of product costs. When the quantity in a bill of
material or inventory record is created, it has a unit of measure listed next to it.


9-9 Review Cost Trends 177

For example, one inch of tape on a bill of materials will have a quantity of one,
and a unit of measure of “IN,” or “‘inch.” However, if the unit of measure is
changed to “RL,” or “roll,” without a corresponding reduction in the amount of
tape listed in the quantity field, the amount of tape picked for production will
increase from one inch to an entire roll. The same problem applies to the inven-
tory, where a change to the unit of measure field without a corresponding change
in the quantity field will result in a potentially massive change in the amount of
inventory on the books. This seemingly minor issue can result in a major change
in the cost of goods sold.

The best practice that resolves this problem is limiting access to the unit of
measure field in the computer system, preferably to one person or position. By
doing so, all changes must be reviewed by one person, who will presumably be
trained well enough to realize the relationship between units of measure and
quantities. If access by multiple people cannot be avoided, then a less-reliable
variation is to require approval by a manager before making a change. However,
as someone can make a change without approval, this system is too easy to
bypass. A third variation is to carefully review changes in the unit of measure
fields after the fact, perhaps with an occasional internal audit, but this approach
only finds problems after they have already been made; the best solution is
always to keep the problem from occurring in the first place.

An excellent alternative is to set up the computer system so that multiple
units of measure are allowed. To use the previous example, the roll of tape can be
listed as both one roll or 1,760 inches in the same inventory or bill of material
record; this approach eliminates anyone’s need to change the unit of measure
field, since all possible variations are already described. Unfortunately, only the
more advanced accounting and manufacturing software packages contain this
feature; it is not normally available unless a company is willing to invest in some
complicated and expensive programming.

9-9 REVIEW COST TRENDS

The typical cost accounting report shows the current cost of each product, per-
haps in relation to a standard cost that was put in place when the product was first
created. Though this report does give management a snapshot of how existing
costs relate to standards, there is no way to see if the cost was gradually increased
or decreased from the preset standard cost, if the actual cost was ever close to the
standard cost, or if there have been sudden changes in costs which are probably
related either to step-costs in the overhead category (such as adding a new facil-
ity) or to material cost changes. Given the lack of information, management has
no way of knowing if the current costing situation reflects a deterioration in costs
or an improvement.


178 Costing Best Practices

The best practice that eliminates this problem is to switch to reporting based
on cost trends. An example is shown in Exhibit 9.2. As noted in the exhibit, the
report starts with a base cost established with actual cost data when the product
was first released to production. Then the series of columns in the middle of the
report show the historical total cost of each product, based on any time period
that is most appropriate (quarterly costs are shown in the exhibit). Then the pro-
jected target cost that the company is striving for is noted to the far right of the
report, with a final column noting the percentage difference in cost between the
most recent cost and the target cost, along with the date by which the company is
expecting to achieve the target cost. This format allows management to easily
determine where costing problems are developing, or if there are potential prob-
lems with reaching a targeted cost by the due date. This approach gives manage-
ment a much more potent tool to use in tracking product costs.

Supplemental information can enhance the information shown on the cost
trend chart. For example, it can include a column showing either unit or dollar
volume for each item, allowing management to quickly determine where it
should invest the bulk of its time in fixing problems—on those products that have
a large dollar impact on total revenues, as opposed to those that may have large
cost variances but that have only a negligible profitability impact. It may also be
useful to include the price and margin in the table, though this can be difficult to
determine if pricing varies significantly by customer, perhaps due to variations on
the volumes sold to each one. Another reporting possibility is to issue a sub-
sidiary-level report that breaks down product costs into multiple components, so
management can determine which costs are deviating from expected values. If
this option is used, there should be matching target costs for each component, so
management can compare actual to expected costs in all categories and see where
there are problems. Finally, if there are many variations on a standard product
design, the report may become too lengthy and unwieldy to be easily readable.

9-10 Review Material Scrap Levels 179

For example, this can happen when the same product is issued in 10 different col-
ors, resulting in a report with 10 line items—one for each product variation. In
this instance, it is useful to cluster product groups together into a single line item
for each group, resulting in a much shorter and more readable report. All or some
of these reporting variations can give management a better idea of the cost trends
to which their products are subject.

9-10 REVIEW MATERIAL SCRAP LEVELS

There are a number of ways to tell if a production process is not operating as effi-
ciently as it could. For example, labor hours are higher than expected, material
usage exceeds the standard, or delivery times are chronically late. However, the
accounting department does not do well in reporting on late deliveries, since this
does not involve the database of financial information that the accounting staff
normally accesses. Also, the direct labor pool tends to be relatively fixed in the
short term, and so is surprisingly difficult to reduce. Thus, accounting reports
showing excessive labor may not result in an immediate impact on this area.
However, reporting on material scrap rates is well worth the effort. The reason is
that a high scrap rate is the primary indicator of a host of potential problems in
the production process. For example, scrap can be caused by poor operator train-
ing, bad machine maintenance, an excessive level of work-in-process inventory,
and design flaws. By using material scrap as the prime indicator of problems in
the production process, management can further refine the reasons for it, target
those problems, and eliminate them.

The problem for the accounting department is how to issue a valid material
scrap rate report. If the report is inaccurate, management will not believe the num-
bers and will not use the information to improve the production process. It is vital to
derive the most accurate information possible from the evidence at hand. There are a
variety of scrap reporting methods available, noted in the following bullet points:

¢ Weigh the scrap. The simplest method for determining the amount of scrap is
to put it in a pile and weigh it. This is a practical approach if a company can
recycle the bulk of its scrap and therefore keeps it in recycling bins. One can
then weigh the bins and multiply the weight by the average cost of the scrap
to determine a total scrap cost.

¢ Summarize receipts from scrap purchasers. An even easier approach is to let
the scrap purchaser weigh the scrap bin and use this information to derive the
total cost of the scrap.

* Compare standard to actual material usage. The approach that results in the
most detailed information about exactly which material has been scrapped is


180 Costing Best Practices

a comparison of standard material quantities to actual usage. This requires
accurate bills of material, production records, and inventory counts; without
them, a comparison of these records will not result in an accurate determina-
tion of scrap costs.

* Create a floor reporting system. This is the approach used the most by those
companies with poor production records. If they cannot use the preceding
option due to the existence of inaccurate bills of material, production records,
or inventory records, they must require the production staff to manually track
the scrap they are generating. This approach tends to underreport scrap, since
production personnel do not like to report on the inefficiencies of their own
department. Also, the scrap reporting by the manufacturing personnel can be
voluminous and may require extra staff to summarize and analyze. Thus, this
approach is prone to inaccuracy and high reporting costs.

Of the previous scrap reporting methods, some are not accurate enough to pro-
vide more than a rough guess at the exact items that were scrapped; these include
weighing the scrap or perusing the receipts from scrap purchasers. The other two
reporting systems reveal the most useful information because they detail the exact
items that were scrapped. Of the two, comparing actual to standard usage is the eas-
iest to implement, since it requires no additional reporting by the manufacturing
personnel; however, the standards must be accurate, or the basis of comparison will
not function properly. If the standards (e.g., bills of material, production records,
and inventory records) are not accurate, one is faced with the problem of either cor-
recting the underlying information or implementing the final reporting option,
which is creating a shop floor reporting system for tracking actual material scrap
rates. The exact reporting method used will depend on the level of reporting detail
needed, as well as the accuracy of a company’s production database.

9-11 REVISE TRADITIONAL COST ACCOUNTING REPORTS

Though many of the other best practices advocated in this chapter involve doing
away with or replacing the existing set of cost accounting reports, there are
instances in which they can be modified sufficiently to still be of great use. This
section deals with a number of small changes that can greatly enhance these
reports. Though it would be best to install all of these upgrades, even using just
one or two of them would bring about an incremental improvement in costing
information. The changes are as follows:

¢ Assemble products into reporting groups. Too often, a cost report presents a
list of hundreds of products, sorted by product number. Though there may be


9-11 Revise Traditional Cost Accounting Reports 181

plenty of valid information in such a report, there is no easy way for a busy
executive to determine where it is. Instead, it should be grouped into relevant
categories, such as clustering all product variations into a single summary
number or clustering product sales by customer. These clusters should always
contain subtotals so managers can take in the total cost impact of each group at
a glance.

* Give rapid feedback. There is no point in compiling a perfect cost analysis if
it is done months after a product is produced. Instead, a good cost report
should be issued as soon as possible after a product is completed, allowing
management to make changes to improve costs the next time the product is
made. The best case of all is when a cost report is issued to management
while a product is still being made (and preferably near the beginning of a
production run) so immediate alterations will result in a rapid cost reduction.

* Only report on exceptions. Some companies have such enormously long cost
reports that there is no way to glance through them and spot the problem sit-
uations. To resolve this issue, reports should be issued that only show excep-
tions. For example, a report may only show those products with negative cost
variances of at least 10 percent. By doing so, a voluminous report can be
reduced to a short memo revealing those items requiring immediate atten-
tion.

¢ Report on costs by customer. All too many cost reports only focus on product
costs, not the total costs of dealing with each customer. By widening the focus
of a traditional cost report to include this extra information, one can reveal
some startling information, especially if a customer that was previously
thought to be highly profitable is eating up an outsized proportion of a com-
pany’s resources in such areas as purchasing, warehousing, and order entry.

¢ Use direct costing. Many costing reports only show product margins after over-
head is included in the total costing mix. However, if the overhead allocation is
not valid, management has no way of knowing what margins really are and usu-
ally ends up ignoring the cost reports entirely. An easy way to avoid this prob-
lem is to insert an extra pair of columns in the cost report, in which are inserted
the dollar margin after direct costs (i.e., price minus labor and materials) and
the direct cost margin percentage. Though this variation leaves no room for
any overhead cost at all, it does result in a good analysis of direct costs.

These best practices focus on assembling information into a format that is
easy to read, relevant, and does not require the reader to wade through vast
amounts of data, and presents information as rapidly as possible. By installing
them, one can make the existing cost reports much more relevant to the deci-
sions that management must make every day.

drastically improve the types of cost information that management can use to
make costing-related decisions.

Of all these best practices, it is difficult to pick out one or two that must be
implemented before all others, due to their impact. The reason is that these best
practices are highly interrelated. For example, an activity-based costing system
provides valuable new information, but no one will see it if the new data is shoe-
horned into the same old cost accounting reports. Similarly, new costing reports
are vital but will still contain inaccurate information unless the underlying data is
improved through regular audits. Thus, it is necessary to install these best prac-
tices as a group in order to obtain the maximum impact of quality information
presented in a new and informative format.

If all of these best practices are installed, the primary impact on the organiza-
tion will be much better costing information than what was previously available
to management. However, the reports will not have an impact on the organization
unless they are acted upon. This calls for a very active role for the controller, who
must peruse the new information, devise action plans based on it, and aggres-
sively market both the reports and his or her conclusions to management on a
continuing basis. Without this proactive approach, senior managers will receive
the new reports and not realize that they are holding a powerful new tool in their
hands. Thus, the controller is the key to the rapid acceptance and use of the new
costing data that will result from the best practices advocated in this chapter.

SUMMARY

This chapter described a number of best practices that impact inventory costing.
Some involve auditing those underlying documents with the greatest impact on
profitability, such as bills of material and labor routings. Others alter or replace
existing cost reports, resulting in better visibility of costing problems. Finally,
target costing and activity-based costing systems can be installed, giving much
control over costs (in the first case) and vastly more accurate information about
costs (in the latter case). These are generally easy implementations, with the
exception of the two new costing systems, but implementing the reports will
require the approval and acceptance of those members of management who will
read them. If properly implemented, all of these changes will result in much bet-
ter knowledge of costs, which, if acted upon, can make the difference between
profits and losses.

easy topic that it does not warrant its own chapter, there are actually many steps
that a progressive accounting staff can take to greatly enhance the efficiency of its
filing work.

This chapter does not focus on doing a better job of filing documents. On the
contrary, filing is a totally nonvalue-added activity, so the focus here is on finding
ways to completely avoid filing. This can be done through a variety of approaches,
including an increased use of electronic documents, standard procedures for destroy-
ing old documents, and keeping paper from being used in the first place. All of
these document prevention techniques are designed to keep paper from ever
reaching the filing staff, thereby allowing a company to reduce the clerical work
associated with filing, while also reducing the amount of space needed to store
documents. These major benefits deserve a separate chapter, no matter how minor
the subject matter may at first appear to be.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES FOR FILING BEST PRACTICES

This section discusses the relative ease or difficulty of implementation of the
best practices to be covered later in this chapter. Each best practice is noted in
Exhibit 10.1. For each best practice, there are columns that note the cost and
duration of implementation. These are relative measures and will vary consid-
erably depending on the circumstances in each company. In general, the overall
level of implementation is considered to be easiest if they are entirely within
the control of the accounting department, such as for adopting a document-
destruction policy. However, if they involve the cooperation of another depart-
ment, or if they require special computer programming to implement, which is
the case for many of the best practices related to storing data on a computer,
then the implementation is assumed to be much more difficult to complete.
The two most expensive best practices are document imaging and extending
the time period before computer records are purged from primary computer stor-
age. The reason for this assessment is data storage—document imaging requires
extremely large amounts of storage, usually involving a compact disc jukebox
with storage levels in the very high gigabyte range, as does increasing primary

storage to extend the time period over which records are kept in the computer
system. In both cases, one should carefully research costs with the assistance of
the computer department before taking any additional implementation steps.

The remainder of this chapter covers the best practices for the filing function
as presented in Exhibit 10.1.

10-1 ADD DIGITAL SIGNATURES TO ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS

One of the primary difficulties with converting paper-based forms to electronic
ones is that many documents require a signature to be affixed to them. This
results in an electronic form being printed out, signed, and then either scanned
back into a digital format or else used from that point forward as a paper docu-
ment. As a result, the multitude of benefits associated with digital documents —
minimal storage costs, infinite replication, ease of search, and so on—are lost.
This problem has recently been corrected through the passage of a new federal
law in June 2000 that legalizes the use of digital signatures.


186 Filing Best Practices

It is still unclear how the courts will rule on the multitude of variations that
can arise in relation to the type of digital signature used. At this time, it is quite
possible that a character-based name on a message will be sufficient, though
encrypted digital signatures that are much more difficult to duplicate will likely
become the norm.

As more companies take advantage of this new law, we will see efficiency
improvements in all of the following areas:

* Customer orders. A customer order typically requires a signature by a corpo-
rate manager, which is then hand-carried, mailed, or faxed to the receiving
company. Digital signatures can cut much of the delivery time out of this
process by sending orders by e-mail straight to the recipient, which will
greatly speed up the order fulfillment process. In addition, it reduces the risk
that an order will be lost (as is frequently the case when orders are faxed).

¢ Human resources. The human resources department is awash in documents
that require signatures—W-4 forms, I-9 forms, 401(k) forms, benefit forms,
and so on. By switching to digital signatures, a company could not only
avoid much of the physical paper flow that is currently needed, but also
reduce much of the face-to-face time between human resources staff and
other employees that is now needed to complete paperwork. This could be
replaced by a vastly greater degree of automation that would convert the
human resources staff from paper processors to managers of the process.

¢ Legal documents. Many business agreements require the transfer of docu-
ments back and forth between the concerned parties, usually by expensive
overnight delivery service, to ensure that signatures are appropriately affixed
before the documents are finalized. This extra time period can be avoided by
the use of e-mail documents.

¢ Purchasing. The purchasing staff can issue purchase orders to suppliers by
e-mail, with full digital authorization, rather than having to laboriously print
out a purchase order, find an authorized signer for it, and fax or mail it to a
supplier. This improved process will greatly increase the speed and effi-
ciency of the purchasing department.

The exact type of digital signatures used will become more apparent as the
cost-effectiveness and security of various solutions become more apparent in the
marketplace. At the moment, the market leaders include Entrust Technologies,
Verisign, and Baltimore Technologies.

10-2 ARCHIVE CANCELED CHECKS ON CD-ROM

The filing and retrieval of canceled checks is a continuing problem for the account-
ing department. Typically, the canceled checks for one month are wrapped up,
tagged with the date, and stored in a box that contains all of the checks for a given
year. This works well, unless someone wants to find a check. Then a staff person
must make a guess as to the month in which the check cleared, root through the
storage box to find the checks that were canceled in that month, open the packet,
and find the check. It may take several tries to even find the correct bundle of
checks, since the date on which a check was printed and the date it was canceled
may be several months apart, depending on the travels of the check in the interim.
After the check has been found, the entire process shifts into reverse in order to re-
store all of the checks. After several such check retrievals, one can expect the qual-
ity of the check filing system to have been downgraded considerably. Several
national banks have surmounted this problem by digitizing the checks.

The new approach is to scan the front and back of every check, digitize the
images, and then store them on a CD-ROM, which is issued on a periodic basis to
the company that cut the checks. Best of all, the CD-ROM comes with an index,
so that one can retrieve checks based on the dollar amount, a range of amounts,
the paid date, issue date, or check number. Given so many search criteria, it is
quite difficult not to find a check copy, and to do so in a matter of moments. Also,
there are no longer any check hard copies left on the premises, so storage issues
are reduced. The only troubles with this best practice are that it is offered by only
a few banks, and that an extra fee is charged for the service.

10-3 ARCHIVE COMPUTER FILES

Some companies have elected to use computer records as a direct replacement for
their paper documents (see the group of best practices shown later in Exhibit
10.4). When this happens, they have certainly eliminated the majority (if not all)
of their filing work, but they have also put themselves at risk of losing electronic
documents if they are not archiving computer records. In a typical organization,
all records are purged from the computer system after one or two years, usually
because maintaining a larger on-line database will require an inordinate amount
of expensive storage space. However, purging these records runs counter to the
document-destruction policies noted later in the section, “Adopt a Document-
Destruction Policy,” in which nearly all documents must be retained for longer
than one or two years. Consequently, storing all documents on a computer system
is not legally possible if the system is to be systematically purged of all records
from time to time.


188 Filing Best Practices

The answer to the purging problem is to archive data before it is purged. This
means that the database must be transferred to some reliable storage medium,
such as back-up tape or compact disc. By doing so, one can retrieve the back-up
storage medium at some later date and review it for data, extracting any elec-
tronic document needed. Though this may seem like a simple matter of inserting
an extra back-up tape into the daily computer back-up procedure and then putting
the extra tape in permanent storage, there are some extra issues to consider. One
is that back-up tapes are not especially reliable over many years. The data on
them will degrade. A better storage medium is a compact disc (CD-ROM),
though using it requires a company to purchase a special storage device that will
write onto the CD-ROM. The other main problem is that the archived data may
be in a format that will be unreadable a few years from now—after all, how many
companies today have equipment that can read data stored on one of the old stor-
age mediums from 20 years ago, such as paper tape or computer cards? The
answer to this problem is a difficult one. It is possible to transfer all key elec-
tronic document images to microfilm or microfiche, or to store all data in the
most “bombproof” of current data storage formats, American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (ASCII). However, technological trends may shift away
from using ASCII in the future, so storing in this format still has risks. Another
option is to go back to all archived data and convert it to whatever the current data
language may be whenever a company changes its systems, an expensive
endeavor. As there is no clear answer to these storage problems, a company may
need to store data in multiple file formats and carefully review the integrity of the
data from time to time to ensure that it is still readable.

Carefully archiving all key computer files prior to purging them from the pri-
mary computer system is a fundamental best practice necessary for a fully digi-
tized filing system to function properly.

10-4 IMPLEMENT DOCUMENT IMAGING

Many companies find themselves in the situation of constantly searching for files.
Perhaps several departments need them at once and the files are constantly shifted
back and forth, resulting in no one able to consistently locate them. Also, some
employees are better than others at returning files when they are finished with them,
while other companies just have a hard time obtaining a qualified group of staff
people who can reliably file documents in the right place. Whatever the case may
be, it is a common problem and one that can seriously impact operations.

One answer to this quandary is to convert all paper documents into digital
ones and store them in the central computer system so that, potentially, all
employees can access them from all locations —and do so at the same time. Digi-
tal documents have the advantage of never being lost (with one caveat, noted later
in this section), never being destroyed (as long as there are proper back-up rou-


10-4 Implement Document Imaging 189

tines taking place), and being available to anyone with the correct kind of access.
These are formidable advantages and have caused many larger corporations to
adopt this approach as the best way to avoid the majority of their filing problems.

To implement a document-imaging system, one must first obtain a document
scanner with a sufficiently high throughput speed and resolution to allow scan-
ning a multitude of documents, as well as scanning with a sufficient degree of
clarity to obtain a quality digital image. This scanner must be linked to a high-
capacity storage device, usually one using multiple compact discs that is called a
“CD jukebox” and a file server containing the index file that tracks the location
of all digital documents stored in the jukebox. A number of terminals are also
necessary to link to this system, so that users may access digitized documents
from as many company locations as necessary. A graphical view of this layout is
shown in Exhibit 10.2.

There are some problems with digital document storage that make it useful
in only selected cases. One is cost—the entire system, especially the storage
device, can easily bring the total cost into the six-digit range, with high-end sys-
tems for large corporations exceeding a million dollars. Also, there is a consider-
able workload required to set up the system, for a large portion of a company’s
existing documents must be scanned into the system, as do new documents that
are generated every day. There is also an issue with legality, for it may be neces-
sary to continue to retain some paper documents, given the murky nature of the
law regarding the acceptability of digitized documents in a legal action. In addi-
tion, if a document is not properly indexed when it is first scanned into the system
(i.e., given an access code that allows a user to more easily find it), it is possible

that there will be great difficulty in later locating it in the computer; in effect, the
document is lost in the storage device. Thus, there are a number of issues to be
aware of before installing such a system. Generally speaking, the cost considera-
tion alone will keep smaller companies from implementing this solution, unless
they are in industries that require enormous amounts of paperwork, such as the
legal or medical professions.

10-5 ELIMINATE STORED PAPER DOCUMENTS IF
ALREADY IN COMPUTER

Most companies store the bulk of their data in their computer systems and then
periodically print it all out and file it away—even though all of the data still exists
in the computer system. Though an argument can be made that employees are
accustomed to handling paper documents more readily than digital ones, and that
computer systems are too unreliable to constitute the sole repository of informa-
tion, these are objections that can be overridden with the proper degree of training
and system changes. In Exhibit 10.4, shown later in the “Total Impact of Best Prac-
tices on the Filing Function” section, there are a number of other best practices
listed that will make a computer system essentially ‘““bombproof;’ and therefore
make it available for use during normal business hours with very few exceptions.
Those best practices, which are described elsewhere in this chapter, are as follows:

¢ Archive computer files

¢ Avoid purging computer records

¢ Extend use of the computer database
¢ Improve computer system reliability

¢ Use document imaging

Once all or most of these best practices have been put in place, it is time to
implement the one described in this section—to eliminate any paper documents
already stored in the computer system. This is a step that must be completed with
extreme care, for the computer system must be thoroughly proven to be fully
operational and virtually incapable of failure before the paper files are removed
from the corporate premises. The logical sequence of steps to follow for this
implementation is to wait for a sufficient period of time to pass to verify that the
computer system is thoroughly “‘bombproof”; then to shift all paper documents
to an off-site location, so that they can still be called back in case of an emer-
gency, and then, after a longer interval, to completely eliminate those documents
except the ones required for legal purposes. This is a long implementation
process that may require several years to complete, but it is essential that the

elimination of paper documents does not interfere with the daily conduct of com-
pany business, which can fail or be severely impacted if the conversion to digital
documents does not go as planned.

10-6 EXTEND TIME PERIOD BEFORE COMPUTER RECORDS
ARE PURGED

An accounting department that relies on the data stored in its computer system to
handle day-to-day transactions has a problem when those records are purged. The
purging process usually occurs during the month-end or year-end closing
process, typically destroying all transaction records that are more than one year
old. When this happens, the accounting staff goes from having immediate access
to all records via their computer terminals to having to retrieve paper documents,
frequently from an off-site storage location. Clearly, this is a major reduction in
the speed and efficiency of the department as it relates to the retrieval of data.

The reason why records are purged is that they take up a considerable
amount of space in the hard drive storage of the computer system. By purging old
records from time to time, it is possible to reduce storage requirements, which
makes it unnecessary to purchase additional storage devices. The best practice
advocated here is actually a set of variations on retaining some or all storage
space, as noted:

¢ Delay purging old records. The most comprehensive way to avoid additional
filing work is to extend the period before which records will be deleted. For
example, an automatic purge after one year can be shifted to a purge after
two years. However, this policy will greatly expand a computer system’s
storage requirements, a serious consideration, especially when the purge
period extends so far back in time that there is a diminishing return on the
usefulness of the data in comparison to the cost of the extra computer stor-
age. Though this is the most common version of the best practice currently in
use, it should not extend storage too far back in time, given the high cost of
doing so.

* Only purge selected files. Rather than purge all records, it may be possible to
only purge those files containing specific types of records. For example,
management may not feel that it is necessary to retain accounts payable
records for more than one year, whereas it may want to retain sales records
for a considerably longer period. Accordingly, the best approach in this case
is to delete specific files regularly, while retaining others for longer periods.
This is an effective way to retain data in the system while spending less
money on computer storage. It is most effective when those files containing


192 Filing Best Practices

the largest numbers of records (and thus the ones that take up the most stor-
age space) are deleted first, such as daily inventory transaction files.

* Only purge obsolete records. An approach that is even more selective than
purging specific files is to purge only specific records. For example, manage-
ment may decide to eliminate the records of all customers with which the
company has not done business for at least two years, while retaining the
records of all current customers for five years. It is usually a simple matter to
extract data from the database that clearly shows which customers can be
deleted, along with all associated information. This method is more labor-
intensive than doing a blanket purge with a single keystroke, but it retains the
information that is most likely to be called into use.

¢ Use slower access storage media. Large corporations that can afford the expense
may transfer older computer files to slower and less expensive tape back-up
systems still linked to the primary computer storage system. By using this
approach, they can allow fairly rapid access to data, even if it is several years
old, by any employee with access to the computer system. However, since the
slower storage devices are still much more expensive than simply purging
data and leaving paper documents in a warehouse, this is typically an option
that is only explored by companies with large computer system budgets.

Any of these alternatives will give the accounting staff better access to old
records, which allows them to avoid the onerous task of manually picking through
old files for needed records. When selecting one alternative over another, it is
necessary to determine the need for various kinds of records, and to retain only
those for which there is a reasonable expectation that some data retrieval will
be needed.

10-7 EXTEND USE OF EXISTING COMPUTER DATABASE

Whenever the person responsible for filing makes the recommendation to have
everyone access data directly through the computer system, rather than through
documents, the response is usually that not everyone has access to the system.
That is, some employees cannot access the correct files they need, they do not
know how to access the information, or they do not have access to the computer
network in order to do so. In most cases, this is not an idle complaint; these peo-
ple really will not be able to function unless significant changes are made to the
computer system.

This best practice is a mandatory one if on-line access to data is to take the
place of paper documents. It involves several steps, which are needed to open up


10-7 Extend Use of Existing Computer Database 193

access to the computer system. This is not an item that can be completed in a hap-
hazard manner, for it is too complicated to complete without using a rigid, step-
by-step approach, which is as follows:

1. Determine who uses information. Before opening up computer access to
employees, it is necessary to determine who needs the access. For example,
it makes no sense to provide computer terminals to everyone in a company,
only to discover that half of them do not have the slightest need for informa-
tion. Accordingly, one should interview all employees to see what they need
and determine where in the computer system that information can be found.

2. Calculate changes in access volumes. If the new system will result in a mas-
sive increase in user access to the system, this should be calculated well in
advance, so that the central computer system can be upgraded to handle the
extra workload. Additional software licenses may also have to be purchased
to cover the extra users.

3. Construct new interface screens. Some of the data that is needed, as dis-
covered in the first step, may not reside in one place in the computer sys-
tem and may require the construction of new screens in the computer that
bring all of the necessary data together for easier use. This can be a labori-
ous step with a large programming budget. It is also next to impossible to
complete if a company uses a packaged software system that is regularly
updated by the supplier, since each update will probably wipe out any cus-
tom programming.

4. Determine type of access. Once all of the data has been clustered into the
appropriate groups for employee use, it is very important to determine who
gets to change the information. If some employees will not be allowed to,
they must be given read-only access rights in the computer system; these
rights may vary by screen, and should be set up well in advance, so that this
task does not interfere with later implementation steps.

5. Add terminals. There may be a need for extra terminals so that all employees
have easy access to the system. This may require stringing additional cable
or the addition of leased phone lines from other locations for off-site access.
It is also important to ensure that there are enough printers provided to meet
the needs of the additional users.

6. Train employees. The last step before going live with the new system is to
train employees in how to use the computer system. This training should
be custom-tailored to the exact needs of each group that will be accessing
different information in the system, and the employees should train on the
terminals, so that they know exactly what to do. They should also be given
one-page summaries that show them how to access the information they
need.


194 Filing Best Practices

These steps can take quite a long time to complete and will require a signifi-
cant budget, so it is important to verify in advance that there is a reasonable pay-
back to the company from implementing it—either through reduced filing costs
or by improving the efficiency of the corporation as a whole.

10-8 IMPROVE COMPUTER SYSTEM RELIABILITY

Many of the recommendations in this chapter are based on the assumption that
paper-based documents can be eliminated by calling up their electronic counter-
parts in a company’s computer system. However, many controllers find that this
assumption will not work, and it meets with great resistance throughout a com-
pany because the computer system has a bad reputation for not being functional
at all times. If the system is down and there are no paper documents that are
immediately available to serve as back-up information, a company can literally
stop functioning at once. Since many departments know this, they resist all
attempts to switch to a purely computer-based information system.

There are a number of steps that a company can take to improve the reliabil-
ity of its computer systems. As many as possible of the following actions should
be taken to improve system reliability. Though even one of them is helpful, the
entire group will go a long way toward creating a ‘“bombproof” system that
employees will have confidence in. The best practices for improving system reli-
ability are as follows:

¢ Battery back-ups. A computer system will experience power failures from time
to time, as well as power spikes or brownouts. All of these problems result in
computer system crashes, which corrupt data and keep the system down for
long periods of time. This problem is an especially vexing one in a manufac-
turing environment, where power spikes may occur when large machinery is
turned on in the same power grid as a company’s computer system. The solu-
tion to this problem is a simple one —just install a battery back-up, also known
as an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) on all file servers or larger com-
puters, as well as every personal computer, terminal, router, and hub—in short,
everything attached to a computer network that requires electricity. By doing
so, a computer system can be completely protected from all power fluctua-
tions. Also, batteries will become worn out and fail over time, so it is critical
to have a battery replacement schedule in place designed to replace batteries
shortly before their scheduled failure dates.

¢ Disk mirroring. Some companies that cannot afford to have any system down-
time at all will use two primary computers to record all transactions, rather
than the more traditional single computer. Under this system, all transactions
are recorded by two computers that are linked together and that mirror each


10-8 Improve Computer System Reliability 195

other’s functions. If one of these computers develops a problem, the other
one takes over all processing and continues operating on its own so that users
have no idea that there is a problem. The damaged computer can be repaired
while the other unit continues to operate. Though this is a more expensive
approach, it guarantees a very high level of system reliability.

¢ Emergency planning and testing. No matter how many precautions a com-
pany takes, it is likely that there will be system crashes from time to time.
Rather than passively hope that these incidents do not occur, it is better to
develop a formal plan for how to deal with them before they happen. By
writing down the precise recovery steps to be followed, one can save a sig-
nificant amount of time in fixing systems. This plan can also be used for
practice; by scheduling periodic training sessions for recovering from system
crashes, one can determine the weak points in the emergency plan, and fix
them before a real emergency occurs. By using this approach, a company can
keep system downtime to a minimum.

¢ Redo cabling. Some employees have difficulty staying on-line with their central
computer systems. This is caused by poorly constructed network cabling,
which may in turn be caused by excessive cable lengths without repeaters,
cables running near power sources (such as machinery), or the wrong types
of cabling. In some cases, the best way to eliminate this problem is to com-
pletely redo the cabling. This may require the installation of top-quality,
high-capacity fiber optic cabling, as well as new hubs. Also, if there are links
to distant locations, it may be necessary to convert from a dial-up modem
access, which runs on standard copper cabling, to a high-capacity T1 phone
line, which is much more reliable, although also much more expensive to
operate. By making these changes, a number of system reliability problems
can be eliminated.

¢ Scheduled downtime. One of the most common employee complaints regarding
system downtime is that maintenance occurs during regular business hours,
rather than at other times. When maintenance, such as system back-ups, test-
ing, or software upgrades, is going on, other users cannot access the system,
which keeps them from performing their jobs. To avoid this problem, it is
very important to cluster standard maintenance work together in a batch and
run it automatically during low-usage periods, such as late at night. Simi-
larly, any other system work that may bring the computer system down must
be carefully scheduled to match low-transaction periods during the work-
week, such as just before or after the regular working hours, or during the
lunch period. The best way to ensure that these times are properly scheduled
is to create a work schedule for the computer department that identifies well
in advance the periods when the system must be brought down, so employees
can be adequately prepared in advance for these periods, and so additional
planning can be done to ensure that the downtime periods are kept to an
absolute minimum.


196 Filing Best Practices

¢ System testing. There is a saying that all systems have bugs in them—you
just may not have found them yet. This is a major problem if a company
implements a new system without proper testing. A rigid testing program
will ensure that new systems have the appropriate back-up systems, will
operate as promised, can handle large transaction volumes, and will handle
unusual transactions. If a new system successfully passes all of these tests,
then it can be put into service. If not, it must be fixed and tested again. Only
by rigidly adhering to tough testing standards can a company provide reli-
able computer systems to its employees.

While all of the preceding system reliability improvements are being imple-
mented, it is extremely important to publicize the progress of the work. If the
improvements are undertaken quietly, employees may still be influenced by a
long tradition of system problems and their opinions will not be changed for a long
time. Instead, to more quickly bring employees to the point of accepting the com-
puter system as their primary source of documents, it is necessary to publicize
current system improvement projects, upcoming ones, and before-and-after mea-
surements that clearly show the improvement in system reliability. Advertising
system changes to employees is one of the best ways to get them to support a
move to eliminate paper-based backup systems.

10-9 ADOPT A DOCUMENT-DESTRUCTION
POLICY WV Author’s Choice

Many companies keep on storing more documents year after year because they
have no idea of when they are supposed to get rid of them. By default, they typi-
cally remain in a heap in the back corner of the most distant warehouse, eating up
space that can be put to better uses. For companies that have been in operation for
many years, this can become a considerable burden due to the many years paper
has been allowed to accumulate, especially if management has a habit of pur-
chasing expensive filing cabinets in which to store old records, rather than less
expensive cardboard storage boxes.

An easy best practice to adopt is to work with a company’s lawyers and certified
public accountants (CPAs) to construct a document-destruction policy similar to the
comprehensive one shown in Exhibit 10.3. The policy should take into account the
document-retention requirements of all federal, state, and local regulatory agencies,
always adopting the longest required retention period. Once this policy has been
completed, the existing pile of paperwork can be sorted through with an eye to elim-
inating all items for which there is no legal reason to keep them. When conducting
this elimination process, however, it is important to keep all documents for which

Once a document-destruction policy has been created to eliminate unneces-
sary paperwork, a common result is for a company to realize a significant savings
in storage space as well as filing cabinets, both of which may be sold off or used

for other more profitable purposes.

10-10 Eliminate Attaching Back-up Materials to Checks for Signing 199

10-10 ELIMINATE ATTACHING BACK-UP MATERIALS TO
CHECKS FOR SIGNING

A common cause for extra filing work is that many check-signers require back-up
documentation to accompany all checks presented to them for signing. They want
the extra information so they can tell exactly why a payment is being made. The
extra paperwork typically includes the complete packet of accounts payable doc-
uments: the supplier’s invoice, the company’s purchase order, and receiving doc-
umentation. To fulfill the wishes of the check-signers, the filing staff must extract
the accounts payable items from files, attach them to checks, wait for the checks
to be signed, and then detach them from the checks and file them away again. All
of this movement of paper also raises the risk that documents will be misfiled
during the process of taking them out of files and then putting them back in.
When this happens, an inordinate amount of time may be required to locate and
refile the missing documents. These activities can take up a considerable propor-
tion of the filing staff’s time.

The best practice that eliminates all of the aforementioned filing work is to
stop attaching accounts payable backup information to checks about to be signed.
Though this seems like a simple and obvious step, it can be a difficult one to con-
vince the check-signers to agree with. By eliminating the back-up materials, the
check-signers have no way of knowing what the company is paying for. The best
way to deal with this complaint is to set up control points earlier in the accounts
payable process, so that the check-signers are so comfortable with the level of
control that goes into creating a check, they no longer care about what they are
signing. Typically, the best control point is the purchase order. If no checks are
cut without a purchase order in hand approved by the correct manager, there is no
need for the additional control point of having one last review of the back-up
documents by the check-signer. It can take some time for a good purchase order
control system to be implemented; it is especially important that all exceptions be
rooted out of the accounts payable system so that all payments are authorized by
a purchase order. The check-signers may want proof of the efficacy of the new
system before they relinquish the back-up documentation, so the controller
should work with the internal audit staff to schedule a review of the purchase
order control system and make any changes that the auditors recommend, in
order to ensure that the new control system works properly. If these changes can
be made, there is no longer any need for back-up documentation for the check-
signers, and a significant proportion of filing time can therefore be eliminated.

200 Filing Best Practices

10-11 ELIMINATE REPORTS V Author's Choice

Most companies are awash in reports. Typically, someone asks the accounting
department to generate a report, which it does—and continues to do for the fore-
seeable future because no one has told it to stop doing so. The majority of these
reports are really only needed once—perhaps to check on the profitability of a
specific product line, or the cost of a service, or the usage of some equipment.
Even though their usage is limited, the accounting department continues to churn
them out and distribute them because the recipients are not aware of the cost of
creating them. A further problem is the distribution of the reports. It is common
for someone who does not realize the expense of distributing a report to have it
sent to everyone in the company who might use it and to many who most cer-
tainly do not. Over time, the accumulation of, in many cases, hundreds of reports,
and the enormous distribution lists creates a startlingly large filing burden. Not
only are these reports stored, in case someone needs them, but they are distrib-
uted, and it is the job of the filing staff to do both things.

The solution to the reports problem is to reduce the number of reports as well
as the number of recipients, but the method of implementing this best practice is
worth some careful consideration. A common approach is to simply stop distrib-
uting reports and to see who complains. However, this is not a very astute politi-
cal move by the controller, since an abrupt halt to reporting can irritate the heads
of any departments who are receiving the information. Instead, it is better to use
the following steps:

1. Issue a list of outstanding reports and distributions. Sometimes it is suffi-
cient to bring to the attention of other departments the extent of the report list
that is being used. If issued along with a list of report recipients, as well as a
plea from the controller to review the lists and cross out any reports and
recipients that are no longer needed, it is usually possible to put a consider-
able dent in the accounting department’s reporting and filing chore.

2. Notify recipients of the cost of reports. If a simple notification of the number
of reports does not result in any significant change, it may be necessary to
notify management of the total cost of creating and issuing those reports. If
the cost is considerable, the management team may authorize the elimination
of several additional reports.

3. Combine reports. Once the report list has been pruned with the previous
steps, it is time to interview the report recipients and see what information on
each report is actually being used. It may then be possible to combine the
data on several reports, resulting in fewer reports that are really needed. For
many companies, these first three steps will bring about a sufficient reduc-
tion in the number of reports without having to proceed to the final two steps.

4. Charge recipients for reports. If there are still a number of reports left to pro-
duce, it may be necessary to charge back the recipients for the cost of both


10-12 Move Records Off-Site 201

creating and distributing the reports (with an extra charge for each additional
person who is sent each report). Incurring an expense for information almost
invariably will cause department managers to take a serious look at cutting
back on their use of reports, which bodes well for the filing staff.

5. Post reports on the computer network. This last option can be substituted for
the previous step of charging for report usage. This one allows the filing staff
to avoid all work by posting electronic reports on the computer network,
where users can access it for themselves. This approach may not work for
some reports that do not convert readily to a readable format for all computer
terminals, nor is it available to those report recipients who do not have a
computer or access to one. Still, given the recent surge in the use of corpo-
rate intranets, this may be the preferred approach of the future for the distrib-
ution of reports.

These steps, taken in the order presented, are usually sufficient to bring about
a drastic reduction in the number of reports being used and issued, which has a
correspondingly large and favorable impact on the quantity of filing work that
can be eliminated.

10-12 MOVE RECORDS OFF-SITE

A controller can have an exceedingly inefficient accounting operation for no
other reason than the presence of an immense amount of records in the account-
ing area, which makes it difficult to find a sufficient amount of operating space
and renders it difficult to find the most current information. Frequently, these
records are kept near the accounting staff on the erroneous grounds that there will
be times when they are needed and that it will be an exceptional hassle to recover
them if they are stored elsewhere. This is a particularly difficult problem if the
accounting staff has been in place for many years and is accustomed to having
records kept close at hand.

The best practice to resolve clutter caused by too many records is to review
the dates of the records and move the oldest items to a secondary location. The
cut-off date for which records will be moved is usually for anything that is not in
the current year of operations. There may be a few cases where additional records
should be kept, such as records from the previous year that the auditors might
request during their annual audit. However, in general, these records can be
moved out with minimal impact on current operations.

The main objectors to this approach will be those staff members who have
grown accustomed to keeping files close at hand, but this objection will usually
recede over time, especially if a good index clearly identifies which storage box


202 Filing Best Practices

contains which records, so that retrieving paperwork is an easy affair. The result-
ing benefits from the change will be a considerable increase in working space and
less need for expensive office space and fewer expensive filing cabinets. The best
improvement of all is that it contributes to overall efficiency, for the amount of
paperwork remaining will be so greatly reduced that it will be an easy matter to
determine where the really crucial files are located, which reduces search time.
Moving records off-site is an excellent method for reducing occupancy costs and
clutter in the accounting area.

10-13 REDUCE NUMBER OF FORM COPIES TO FILE

Over time, it is a common occurrence for a company to continually add to the
number of copies of printed documents. For example, an invoice that starts
with two copies—one for the customer and one for the company —may later
have another copy added, so that invoices can be filed in numerical order, and
perhaps another copy, so that the customer service department (or some other
department) can have an extra copy. These additional documents are usually
added without much thought to the consequences for the filing staff, which
must put away all of those extra copies. Also, additional document copies
result in more expensive documents (since there is more paper involved), as
well as, in some cases, a much more heavy-duty printer that can punch
through such a thick sheaf of documents (which can also bunch up quite eas-
ily, causing a printer jam). Thus, a large number of document copies results in
a multitude of problems, not the least of which is a considerable increase in
the workload of the filing staff.

The best practice that eliminates this problem is to reduce the number of
copies. However, this is not a simple matter of ordering new documents with
fewer parts. Both costs and politics can become an issue when implementing
what appears to be, on the surface, a very simple matter. The main cost is that
there may be many documents still in stock with extra copies. If so, it makes
little sense to throw them all out. Instead, use them up, throwing away the extra
copies that are generated, and then order new documents when the old ones are
gone. The main problem is politics. If there is an extra copy being generated, it
is a good bet that someone in the company asked for the extra copy and that
person will not be happy when the copy is eliminated. If the person who wants
the extra copy is a highly placed manager, it is unlikely that the change will go
unnoticed or tolerated. Instead, if persuasion does not work, it is probable that
implementation will be impossible until that person leaves the company or
moves to a position having less influence over the decision. Also, before decid-
ing to stop using a document copy, it is mandatory that the exact use of the


Summary 203

copy be clarified with all users to ensure that there is not a problem if it is no
longer printed.

Despite the number of possible problems, this is a best practice that can usu-
ally be implemented at least in part and will result in immediate gains for the fil-
ing staff in exchange for a moderate amount of implementation effort.

TOTAL IMPACT OF BEST PRACTICES ON THE FILING FUNCTION

This section groups together all of the best practices described in this chapter
and shows how they can be applied in a typical corporate environment. As
opposed to the best practices in most other chapters of this book, all of the fil-
ing best practices can be installed together, for they are not mutually exclu-
sive. They tend to cluster into two categories: those that are concerned with
the reduction of manual filing labor and those that are intended to completely
avoid filing by using a company’s computer system as the primary data stor-
age point. Though the computer system is obviously the more advanced and
efficient method of storage, it takes a long time to convert a company entirely
to that storage medium (if only because of employee resistance), so it is rec-
ommended that all of the best practices, including those for manual filing, be
implemented.

As noted in Exhibit 10.4, there are six best practices that are associated with
the manual filing function. Some involve cleaning up the work area by either
moving old documents off-site or by using a document-destruction policy to
entirely eliminate them. Other best practices eliminate documents before they
ever have a chance to be filed, by such means as stopping the use of reports and
reducing the number of form copies. The other main category of best practices
assumes that there will be less need for filing work if documents are stored in a
company’s computer system. If so, the main focus is on increasing computer
access to the largest possible number of employees, while also increasing the
reliability of the computer system and storing the largest possible amount of
information on it. By implementing the largest possible combination of these
activities, one can, at a minimum, bring about a reduction in a company’s filing
workload, and may even be able to eliminate the majority of the work.

SUMMARY

practices covered how to use a computer system as the logical storage location
for information, rather than a filing cabinet. This second alternative is the pre-
ferred approach, since it gives everyone with computer access the ability to call
up a document without any risk of damaging or losing the information on the
digitized document. However, there are a number of steps that a company must
take to ensure that information is properly stored on its computer system and
that the system is sufficiently operational during working hours to act as a
proper substitute for a manual filing system. Thus, the best practices described
in this chapter cover the two main filing alternatives —the filing cabinet and the
computer system.

Finance Best Practices

This book is primarily about improving the accounting function, not the finance
function. However, this area is commonly integrated into the accounting depart-
ment in smaller organizations, where the cost of a treasury staff cannot be justi-
fied. Thus, this area becomes part of the accounting function, and so a limited set
of best practices are included here. They are primarily oriented toward treasury,
risk management, and investor relations applications that can be located on the
Internet. The reason for so many Internet-based best practices is that they can be
readily accessed and used at a moderate cost, since there is no software to install
on one’s computer or large up-front costs to incur. These are important issues for
the controllers of smaller companies, who can quickly browse through the Web
site addresses that are sprinkled throughout this chapter, and see which applica-
tions will be of the most use to them.

Only in one case is an expensive and time-consuming best practice listed —
the use of a treasury workstation. It is really only cost-effective for a larger com-
pany, but is included here because it does such a good job of integrating and
improving on a number of rote treasury functions. It is highly recommended for
those organizations that can afford it, but its substantial cost should be carefully
reviewed before a decision is made.

This chapter begins with a short review of the level of implementation diffi-
culty for each finance best practice, and then moves on to individual discussions of
each one. There is no final section that describes how these items can be used in
concert, since these functions operate just as well if implemented individually —
there is little efficiency to be gained through overlapping finance best practices.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES FOR FINANCE BEST PRACTICES

This section notes in Exhibit 11.1 the level of implementation difficulty that one
can expect when installing the finance-related best practices in this chapter.
Exhibit 11.1 describes the cost and duration of implementation for each best
practice. Since most of the best practices are Internet-based, there is no up-front
acquisition cost, which keeps the cost of implementation squarely in the “inex-
pensive” category. However, many of these services are fee-based or require extra
fees for advanced services, so there will be incremental charges associated with
their use.

The duration of implementation for these Internet-based applications is
listed as “medium” in the exhibit, though a company can make them operational

in a relatively short time. The reason for the longer expected implementation
duration is that one may find that a specific Web site does not precisely match
one’s expectations, which may result in some shopping among related sites to
find a better match. Alternatively, some missing functionality may have to be
shifted in-house, which also requires more time to implement.

11-1 OBTAIN FINANCING THROUGH INTERNET LENDER SITES

Obtaining financing can be a slow and laborious process for the chief financial
officer. In particular, he or she must fill out the same lending applications for each
lender contacted—the information provided is almost the same for each lender,
but each one has a different form that must be completed in order to process an
application. Also, if a company’s needs are quite specialized, it may require an
extensive search through dozens of lenders to find one willing to extend funds. In
addition, the accounting staff must retain a voluminous file of lending documents
for each loan outstanding, which can be a considerable amount if there are a mul-
titude of leases and loans.

These problems can be avoided by shifting a company’s lending activities to
an Internet-based lending site, such as www.capital.com or www.puremarkets.com.
These sites have established electronic links to several hundred lenders, to which
the company can send its lending application. By having access to so many
lenders, the CFO has an excellent chance of making contact with a qualified
lender in short order. Also, because the Web site requires one to complete only a
single standardized borrower application, the request for proposals effort is vastly
reduced—many CFOs feel that this is the primary reason to use an Internet-based
lending site. Further, some sites address more complex financing needs, such as the
funding required for rollups, turnarounds, management buyouts, and recapitaliza-
tions. In addition, some sites even offer to store all the text in one’s completed
lending documents, thereby taking the document maintenance chore completely
away from the accounting staff. However, one must be cognizant of the chance


11-3 Take a Business Unit Public 209

that all lending information stored on-line could evaporate if the Web site goes
out of business. Also, most lending deals available on these sites are only for
loans or leases of at least $1 million, which blocks out the financing needs of
many smaller companies.

11-2 PURCHASE DEBT DIRECTLY FROM THE GOVERNMENT

A company that has excess cash is typically constrained by its lending policies to
investments in a limited number of high-grade debt instruments that carry mini-
mal risk and can be easily liquidated. In many cases, the only allowable invest-
ment are Treasury notes, bills, and bonds of the United States government. How-
ever, companies have been forced to pay commissions to brokers and resellers in
order to obtain these types of investments.

But there is no transaction fee for purchasing government debt directly from
the United States Treasury through its www.publicdebt.treas.gov Web site. One
can use the site to create a TreasuryDirect account for making electronic pur-
chases of debt. Though the intent of the site is to sell debt that is held to maturity,
one can request a debt sale through the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago via the
Treasury’s Sell Direct system; the government will then sell one’s debt invest-
ments on the open market in exchange for a $34 fee per security sold. The usual
investment will be in Treasury bills, since they have the shortest term to maturity
and can therefore liquidate prior to any need for a commissionable sale to a bro-
ker or reseller. More information about this service is available by downloading
the TreasuryDirect Investor Kit from the aforementioned Web site.

11-3 TAKE A BUSINESS UNIT PUBLIC

A company with multiple business units can have numerous problems related to
them: Investors are unclear about the operating results of each unit, there may be
significant differences in the perceived market value of some units, other units do
not fall into the core business area, and unit managers have no incentive to
improve their stock performance when their units have only a minor impact on
overall corporate results. All of these issues can be addressed to some degree by
taking a business unit public.

One approach for going public is the equity carve-out. Under this approach,
a company creates a separate legal entity for a subsidiary, with a separate board
of directors, and sells shares in it to the public through an initial public offering.
This approach is usually taken when the unit has a high perceived value by the


210 Finance Best Practices

equity markets that will result in a high share price, and therefore considerable
cash received by the corporate parent. Usually, the parent company retains some
measure of ownership over the business unit.

Another option is the spinoff, which is a simple distribution of shares in the
business unit to existing shareholders as a stock dividend. This approach is usu-
ally taken when the corporate parent wishes to completely sever its ownership of
a business unit, frequently because it does not fit into the overall area of corporate
focus.

Finally, the corporate parent can issue a tracking stock in a business unit.
This requires no new legal entity, and therefore no separate board of directors.
Shares are usually issued as a stock split from the shares of the corporate parent,
with shareholders receiving a claim on the future earnings of the designated busi-
ness unit; the parent continues to control the unit. This approach is usually taken
when the parent feels the value of the unit will increase on the equity market,
resulting in gains for shareholders.

No matter which of these approaches is taken, there are a number of benefits.
First, investors receive operating and financial information about a specific busi-
ness unit, which gives them more information upon which to make investment
decisions. Second, the value of shares is more tightly linked to the performance
of specific business areas, which is also of use to investors. Third, business units
can bring in equity capital for their own use, which may improve the amount of
cash available to them than would be the case if they were competing for corpo-
rate funding with other business units. Fourth, subsidiaries can use their own
stock to engage in merger and acquisition activities. Finally, creating stock for a
business unit is a powerful incentive for its business managers if they are given
stock options that are linked to those shares, since the managers have a major
impact on the future value of the business unit.

11-4 USE INTERNET-BASED TECHNICAL ANALYSIS SERVICES

Some investors believe that the future performance of a stock can be determined
by a careful evaluation of how it has performed in the past. While others feel that
this is akin to driving down a road by looking in the rearview mirror, it may still
have some validity for reviewing historical trends and making investment deci-
sions based on this information.

Technical analysis information can now be obtained on the Internet by
accessing www.techrules.com. This site uses a simulation laboratory, in which
prospective investors can enter either a single stock or a weighted portfolio, and
determine their historical performance, including the impact of trading costs and
profit reinvestment. There is also a page that converts this information into a

graphical representation of performance and variability. The site also includes
direct access to a variety of brokers who can execute orders.

11-5 PHASE OUT SMALL INVESTORS

A recent study by PriceWaterhouseCoopers indicates that it costs a public corpora-
tion more than $19 each year in servicing costs for each of its shareholders, regardless
of the number of shares held. Since many shareholders only own a few shares, a large
part of this expense is needed to support a group of inconsequential shareholders.

Some of the expense can be eliminated by conducting a periodic “odd-lot”
shareholder program. Under this program, a company contacts those shareholders
with very small holdings and either offers to buy back their shares at a modest
premium or asks the shareholders to buy enough additional shares to bring their
holdings up to a minimum of 100 shares. Though the offer is generally taken by
fewer than half of these small shareholders, it does help to gradually reduce the
number in this group of shareholders.

The trouble with this program is the cost of periodically contacting share-
holders to make them the offer, especially since there tend to be diminishing
returns from the program, with the initial offer clearing out the largest number of
shareholders, while the remaining pool of investors is less likely to accept later
offers. However, one can spread out the timing of successive rounds of offers to
shareholders in order to lower the cost.

11-6 OPEN CONFERENCE CALLS TO THE PUBLIC

The Securities and Exchange Commission recently issued Regulation FD, which
requires full disclosure of all information normally released by public companies
to investment analysts to the entire investing public. Some companies have
reacted to this ruling by issuing as little information as possible to anyone. How-
ever, the majority have taken the opposite course and become more open in their
informational releases.

A good way to be in compliance with Regulation FD is to open all investor
conference calls to the public. A number of companies provide conference call
services, such as A+ Conference, CogniConference, and RCI. The conference call
services and prices of these companies can be compared on the www.conference
callcompany.com Web site. Besides the price per minute charged, one can also
rate the various services on their ability to provide a Web interface for calls, tran-
scribe calls, mute callers, and so on. One can then arrange with a number of Web-


212 Finance Best Practices

based investor notification services, such as www.bestcalls.com, www.vcall.com,
and www.companyboardroom.com to automatically notify their subscribing
investors of the times when they can access these calls. The only limitation on
this approach is the number of investors allowed on a conference call, which one
can select based on the type of conference call paid for. For example, one confer-
ence call company only allows 16 participants in a call, but offers the lowest rate
per minute, while another allows 5O participants but at a slightly higher cost to
the company.

11-7 OUTSOURCE THE COMPANY STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

Many publicly held companies have a stock purchase plan, which they use to
attract incremental investments by long-term investors who wish to buy small
numbers of shares on a regular basis. Some plans even take regular deductions
from investor bank accounts on an ongoing basis, so repeat contributions require
no effort by investors. An additional feature is that some plans automatically re-
invest dividends (known as dividend-reinvestment plans, or DRIPs). Such plans
are valuable, because they attract those investors who are least likely to sell off
shares at the slightest sign of earnings volatility. The only problem with these
accounts is the cost of servicing them, which is typically in the range of $19 per
year for each investor. Though this may seem insignificant, it can add up if there
are thousands of participating investors.
A simple best practice that relieves a company of this cost is to shift the
plans over to a brokerage firm. A brokerage firm is more than happy to take on
these plans, since they can then charge fees to the participating investors. In
essence, the company has shifted the cost of the stock purchase plan to investors.
However, if making the investment experience as simple and trouble-free for
investors as possible is more important to a company, then retaining the function
in-house in order to avoid charging brokerage fees to investors may be a better
approach. Another problem with this method is that on-line brokerages that handle
these accounts allow investors to sort through the various plans for such features
as the size of the initial investment and the required size of ongoing investments,
which means that a company’s plan is essentially competing for investor attention

11-8 SELL SHARES IN AN INTERNET-
BASED AUCTION! WV Author’s Choice

Any initial public offering (IPO) is an exceedingly expensive process, due to the
massive accounting, legal, and underwriting fees involved. In addition to these
expenses, it is entirely possible that the initial stock issuance will be somewhat
underpriced, because the underwriters have usually committed to purchase the
entire stock issuance from the company, and so want to flip their investment over to
investors as soon as possible. There is also some suspicion that they are pricing an
issuance low in order to sell shares to parties to whom they owe favors. Whatever
the case may be, the traditional IPO share sale tends to result in low prices, which
takes cash away from the company and forces it to issue more shares in order to
reach its cash target, thereby ceding more share voting control to outside entities.

An alternative to the traditional sale of stock through an underwriter is to use
an “OpenIPO” auction. Under this approach, potential investors download a
prospectus over the Internet from an underwriter that specializes in this type of
offering. If they wish to bid on the shares, they open an account with the under-
writer, select a bid price and the number of shares desired, and send the under-
writer a check for that amount. This bid can be withdrawn at any time prior to the
offering date. Based on the range of bids received, the underwriter then creates a
public offering price at which share purchases will be accepted (which matches
the price of the lowest bid received, below which all other bids exceed the num-
ber of shares to be offered). All investors bidding above this price will be issued
their full share allocations, while those whose bids were below the price will be
refunded their money. Those investors bidding the exact amount of the public
offering price will receive some portion of their requested number of shares,
depending on how many other investors requested shares at that price, and how
many shares are still available for sale. This approach tends to result in higher
share prices, resulting in either more proceeds flowing to the company or fewer
shares being sold (resulting in more control by the original shareholders).

For example, a company wishes to sell 1 million shares to the public.
Investors bid for 500,000 shares at $14 each, while bids are also received for
300,000 shares at $13.50 and 600,000 at $12.00. Since the entire offering can be
sold at a price of $12, this becomes the public offering price. All investors bid-
ding at prices of $14 and $13.50 per share will receive their full allocations of
shares, and will pay $12 per share. Of the 600,000 shares bid at $12, investors
will receive only one-third of their requested amounts, since this will result in 1
million shares being sold, which was the original target.

11-9 USE WEB BROADCASTING FOR PUBLIC REPORTING

Publicly held companies are supposed to issue financial information to the public
through the quarterly reporting process. However, this has, until recently, only
required the issuance of standard quarterly financial statements and an annual
meeting. Any further information was frequently limited to meetings with
selected Wall Street analysts. This reduced level of information dispersal has now
come to an end, thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s new Regu-
lation FD (for Fair Disclosure). This new rule requires companies to make a
broad disclosure, through a press release at a minimum, whenever company offi-
cers release important information about the company to any outsiders. Though
the traditional press release is sufficient for compliance with the regulation, it is
also possible to generate much broader distribution of this information through
the use of a webcast.

A webcast is simply a conference call that is posted on the Internet for gen-
eral access. It allows virtually anyone to listen in on the discussions between
company managers (usually the chief executive officer or chief financial officer)
and outside analysts regarding company-specific information. This is a very inex-
pensive approach to disseminating information. It also keeps analysts from get-
ting access to tidbits of company information that they can in turn send out to
their clients as hot tips (especially since their clients may have been listening to
the same webcast), unless the webcasts are issued on a time-delayed basis.

A provider of webcasts is Corporate Communications Broadcast Network,
whose Web site can be reached at www.ccbn.com. This company facilitates webcasts
by setting up basic audio webcasts for quarterly conference calls; it also offers an
enhanced audio webcast that is set up through a separate Web page that looks like
a page from a company’s regular Web site but that has special features, such as a
time delay on the broadcast and access to detailed audience reporting, in order to
find out who has monitored the webcast. The company also offers an advanced
feature called “Virtual Presentations” that synchronizes audio presentations with
PowerPoint slides, using its TalkPoint™ technology. This option can be used for
other purposes, such as training presentations, product demonstrations, and
advertising.

11-10 AUTOMATE OPTION TRACKING

When a large number of employees have company options, either the finance or
human resources department will be the target of ongoing questions about the vest-
ing, valuation, and tax implications of these options. Because the tax laws are so
complex in this area, employees keep coming back with follow-up clarification
questions, as well as to run “what if” scenarios on what they should do under various


11-12 Automate 401(K) Plan Enrollment 215

circumstances. Given a large number of employees with many option grants, this
can turn into a major drain on company resources. In addition, a company runs the
tisk of giving bad advice to its employees, which may have legal repercussions if
employees using this advice lose money through the exercise of options.

A solution for larger companies is to purchase an options tracking package,
which they can use alternatively as an in-house solution or as a featured service
on the external site of an application service provider. An example of such soft-
ware is Express Options, which is sold by Transcentive, Inc. The system stores all
options information in a single database, allowing one to handle multiple grant
types, determine vesting schedules, track option exercises and cancellations, and
provide employees with tax-related information. It also calculates option valua-
tions, exports data to the company stock transfer agent, and provides a variety of
reports for regulatory purposes. By using Transcentive’s add-on product, Express
Desktop, employees can access such information about their options as portfolio
valuations based on different stock pricing assumptions, “what if” modeling,
transaction histories, and frequently asked questions. They can also place orders
to exercise their options through the system.

For this type of service, one can expect to pay a minimum of $15,000 annu-
ally, with the price exceeding one-third of a million dollars per year for larger
installations. Given its cost, this best practice is most applicable to corporations
with at least several hundred option holders.

11-11 USE INTERNET-BASED OPTIONS PRICING SERVICES

Any accounting or treasury staff that deals with options knows that this is a difficult
area to analyze in terms of whether an options price is reasonable or excessive. One
can now gain assistance in this effort by accessing the excellent www.ivolatility.com
Web site. This site compares the historical volatility of a stock to its estimated
activity for the next few months, as determined through an examination of
options purchased. If the forward-looking volatility is greater than the historical
volatility, then the options on that stock may be overpriced. The site also includes
daily charts and statistics about market performance, as well as linkages to news
sources for each selected stock. There is a wealth of information at this site.

11-12 AUTOMATE 401(K) PLAN ENROLLMENT

In smaller organizations, the accounting department is tasked with the manage-
ment of 401(k) plan additions, changes, and deletions. This is not an efficient


216 Finance Best Practices

process, for someone must arrange for a meeting with each employee who has
now been working for the minimum amount of time, as specified in the plan
documentation, explain the plan’s features to them, wait for them to take the
plan materials home for review, and, finally, enter the returned documents into
the system of the 401(k) provider. This is a lengthy and time-consuming
process.

An alternative is to automatically enroll employees in the 401(k) plan. This
is also known as a “negative election,” since an employee must make a decision
not to be enrolled in the plan, rather than the reverse. This approach has the con-
siderable advantage of reducing the paperwork needed to enter a person into the
401(k) plan, since it is done as part of the hiring process, along with all other
paperwork needed to set up a new employee.

There are only minor downsides to this best practice. With more employees
in the plan, there will be somewhat higher fees charged by the 401(k) service
provider (which are typically charged on a per-person basis). Also, there will still
be some paperwork associated with those employees who do make a negative
election. Finally, since the group of employees who tend to be added to the
401(k) plan through this method are at the lower end of the income stratum, it is
more likely that they will want to take out loans against their invested funds, each
of which calls for more paperwork.

Cost: SS Installation time:

11-13 GRANT EMPLOYEES IMMEDIATE 401(K) ELIGIBILITY

The most common way to enroll employees into a company’s 401(k) pension
plan is to make them wait either 90 days or a year from the date of hire. This calls
for the maintenance of a list of dates for newly hired employees that must be
watched to ascertain when someone become available for this benefit. Then they
must be contacted and scheduled for a short lecture about how the plan works and
how to invest in it. Then they complete paperwork to enroll, which is forwarded
to the payroll department so that deductions can be made from their paychecks
for advancement to the 401(k) plan administrator. All of the steps can more easily
be compressed into the hiring process, as was just noted in the “Automate 401(k)
Plan Enrollment” section in this chapter. However, the issue can be taken one
step further by not only completing all of the paperwork at the time of hire, but
also by actually allowing immediate participation in the plan at the time of hire.
This represents less a matter of improved efficiency than of giving new employ-
ees a fine new benefit, for they can begin investing funds at once, which may lead
to a reduced level of employee turnover.

The main problem with this best practice is that new employees can impact a
company’s ability to pass pension plan nondiscrimination tests, especially if the
new hires are at low pay scales. If these new employees do not invest a reason-


11-15 Obtain Advance Rating Assessments 217

able proportion of their salaries in the 401(k) plan, this can force highly compen-
sated employees to limit their plan contributions to less than the maximum
amounts. Nonetheless, if there is a perception that immediate eligibility for the
plan will improve the employee turnover rate, then this should be considered the
overriding issue.

Cost: SS Installation time:

11-14 CONSOLIDATE INSURANCE POLICIES

Insurance policies are frequently added to a company’s insurance portfolio in a
piecemeal manner. Someone on the management team decides that some addi-
tional coverage is needed to mitigate a perceived risk, and so an additional pol-
icy is added—sometimes beginning at a different time of the year from the other
policies already in existence, and perhaps with different insurance companies.
This can be an expensive approach, for each insurer must factor in potential loss
costs plus operating expenses and profit—on each policy it issues.

A better alternative is to aggregate the policies with a single insurer. By doing
so, insurers can see that their administrative cost will be the same, despite the
much higher volume of insurance, and so they can reduce their insurance prices.
Also, there is little risk that claims will arise on every single policy held, so the
overall risk to the insurer declines — which in turn can reduce prices yet again.

This option is best used by large companies with large-dollar insurance poli-
cies, since insurers will want their business badly enough to be willing to reduce
prices based on the factors just noted.

Cost: SS Installation time:

11-15 OBTAIN ADVANCE RATING ASSESSMENTS

A company with publicly held debt can never be sure about the change in its rat-
ing by a major rating service after it has taken some significant action, such as an
acquisition or a major capital investment. If the rating agency decides after the
fact that the company’s action has downgraded the credit level on its debt, then
the reduced ranking may trigger a number of adverse financial items—such as a
drop in the market price of the debt in order to increase its effective interest rate,
or difficulty in obtaining additional debt at a reasonable price.

This problem can be overcome by using Standard & Poor’s Rating Evalua-
tion Service. This service allows a company to obtain a confidential review of its
credit rating by a Standard & Poor’s analyst who will issue a prospective credit
rating based on the proposed action. This is a particularly valuable service when a
company has a range of action items to choose from and is willing to change its


218 Finance Best Practices

strategic direction based on which action results in the best credit rating. Since
the ratings derived by Standard & Poor’s are based on prospective actions that
may never be implemented, the ratings will be kept confidential until such time as
the company makes its plans public. Examples of possible activities that could
require a prospective credit analysis are asset sales or divestitures, stock buy-backs,
mergers or acquisitions, financial restructurings, recapitalizations, expansions
into new lines of business, and modifications to the corporate legal structure.

The primary difficulty with this best practice is the considerable fee required
to have these analyses performed. The fee charged will increase for each addi-
tional strategic option a company wishes to have analyzed, so having a broad
range of possible actions reviewed will be expensive.

11-16 RENT A CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANY

Companies are having increasing difficulty obtaining reasonably priced insurance
of all types, if they can obtain insurance at all. Captive insurance companies have
been used to provide access to insurance. They are run by a single company, an
association of companies, or by an entire industry in order to solve particular
insurance problems. Though the use of captive insurance companies has been a
longstanding option for obtaining at least some of the necessary insurance, this
option has required extensive legal analysis, incorporation costs, and significant
initial capitalization fees that have limited their use. Also, sharing a captive with
other companies has, until now, meant that a company must share in the risks
incurred by other companies, which can present an uncomfortably high risk profile.

Over the past few years, changes in the legal requirements for captive insur-
ance companies have brought about the creation of the rent-a-captive. Under this
legal structure, a captive insurance company has already been created by a third
party that rents it out for use by multiple companies. The structure is usually in
the format of “protected cells,’ whereby each company using one can shield its
contributed capital and surplus from other renters that are also using the captive.
Not only does this format prevent a company from dealing with the initial start-up
costs of a captive insurance company, but it also allows it to retain any underwriting
profit and investment income from contributed funds. The company can even
recover a low-claim bonus at the end of the rent-a-captive contract, though it can
also be liable for additional claims payments that exceed its initial or subsequent
contributions into the captive. This format is especially useful for those companies
faced with moderate risks that have reduced their frequency of claim incurrence.
Conversely, it is less useful for companies seeking catastrophic coverage or that
have high volumes of small-claim activity.

The creators of rent-a-captive insurance companies usually charge a percent-
age fee of premiums paid into the captives in exchange for their use, while some

also take a share of the investment profit. This option is cost-effective for those
companies paying at least half a million dollars in insurance expenses per year.
One should also pay for up-front legal advice on both the applicability of this
approach and the tax deductibility of contributions made into a rent-a-captive.

11-17 USE INTERNET-BASED RISK MEASUREMENT SERVICES

Anyone who invests in various types of equity on behalf of a company may, from
time to time, have a queasy feeling that there is some degree of risk associated with
those investments, but has no way of quantifying it without paying for the services
of a finance expert. Also, it may be useful to report to senior management on the
measured risk of the current basket of investments, if only to provide a defense in
case there is a drop in their value at some point in the future. This valuable risk
analysis tool is now available through the Internet at www.riskgrades.com.

This on-line service grades the risk of any equity that the user enters into the
system, reviewing its equity, interest rate, currency, and commodity risk. This
results in a “RiskGrade” that is an indicator of risk based on the volatility of
returns. RiskGrades are determined by comparing the current estimated return
volatility of an asset to the market-cap weighted average return volatility of a set
of equity markets during normal market conditions. A RiskGrade of zero indicates
price volatility of zero (as would be the case for pure cash holdings), with higher
RiskGrade ratings indicating a higher degree of volatility. These RiskGrade
scores can then be used to compare the risks of various assets or entire portfolios.

11-18 CENTRALIZE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MANAGEMENT

A company that has multiple divisions conducting business with other countries
may be spending too much money hedging its foreign exchange risk. Each divi-
sion will hedge its exposure without regard to the exchange positions of the other
divisions, which may result in excess hedging costs. The reason for the excess
costs is that one division may have a large account receivable that is payable in
(for example) British pounds, while another division may have a payable in
British pounds. Each one may pay to hedge the risk on pounds, when in reality,
from the perspective of the entire company, the receivable and payable positions
of the two divisions offset each other. Only the difference between the two posi-
tions needs to be hedged, which is less expensive.


220 Finance Best Practices

Another problem is that there are intercompany payments between sub-
sidiaries located in different countries; these transactions should be netted to
arrive at the minimum possible flow of foreign exchange.

To take advantage of these offsetting positions, a company needs to central-
ize its foreign exchange management in one place, so that a coordinated effort to
net out all exchange risks can be created. This is not just a matter of moving all of
the foreign exchange people from outlying locations into one building, but also
(and much more importantly) a matter of channeling the flow of foreign
exchange information from all divisions into a single location. This may call for
customized interfaces from each division’s accounting systems to the central
database, or perhaps an extract of data from a centralized data warehouse (see
Chapter 14). This function can also be outsourced to a bank that specializes in
foreign exchange netting, such as CitiBank or Bank of America, though one
should periodically comparison-shop their foreign exchange rates to ensure that
they are competitive. It can even be manually stored in an electronic spreadsheet,
though this approach requires some attention to the transfer of all intercompany
payables and receivables to the person who is netting out the transactions; this
involves setting a timetable that specifies a monthly settlement date, and then
works backwards from that date to determine the deadlines by which all sub-
sidiaries must report their payables and receivables. Once this information is
gathered, it must then be merged to determine a company’s net foreign exchange
position at any given time. Once this information is available, a company will be
able to achieve significant cost reductions in its hedging activities.

There are two other factors favoring the use of centralized foreign exchange
management. One is that the reduced amount of currency being shifted between
corporate subsidiaries results in a smaller amount of cash float within the organi-
zation (though this can be eliminated entirely with the use of wire transfers instead
of checks). The other possibility is to use the netting of intercompany payables
and receivables to make leading or lagging payments, which are effectively short-
term loans that may assist in dealing with short-term cash flow problems at cer-
tain subsidiaries. However, these changes in the timing of payments can take on
the appearance of intercompany loans, so expert international tax advice should
be obtained before trying such an activity.

11-19 INSTALL A TREASURY WORKSTATION

The multitude of treasury-based transactions can take up a large part of the finance
staff’s workday and is highly subject to error. These tasks involve management of
a company’s cash position, investment and debt portfolio, and risk analysis. The
normal approach to these tasks is to track, summarize, and analyze them on an
electronic spreadsheet, with manual input derived from all of the company’s banks


11-19 Install a Treasury Workstation 221

and investment firms on a daily basis. In addition, any changes that result from this
analysis, such as the centralization or investment of cash, must be manually
shifted to the general ledger. Given the highly manual nature of these tasks, this
frequently results in errors that must be corrected through the bank reconciliation
process. A treasury workstation can greatly reduce many of these work steps.

A treasury workstation is a combination of hardware and software that will
manage cash, investments, debt issuance and tracking, as well as provide some
risk analysis functions. It is an expensive item to purchase, typically ranging
from $30,000 for a bare-bones installation to $300,000 for a fully configured one.
The difference between these prices is the amount of functionality and bank
interfaces added to the treasury workstation—if a buyer wants every possible fea-
ture and must share data with a large number of financial suppliers, then the cost
will be much closer to the top of the range. Given these costs, this best practice is
not cost-effective for companies with sales volumes under $50 million. Also,
because of the large number of interfaces needed to connect the workstation to
other entities, the installation time can range from one to nine months.

Why spend so much money and installation time on a treasury workstation?
Because it automates so much of the rote finance tasks. For example, if an employee
enters an investment into the system, it will create a transaction for the settlement,
one for the maturity, and another for the interest. It will then alter the cash forecast
with this information, as well as create a wire transfer to send the money to an
investing entity. Here are some of the other functions that it can perform:

¢ Bank reconciliation. It can do the bulk of a bank reconciliation, leaving just a
few nonreconciling items to be resolved by an employee.

* Cash forecasting. It can determine all company cash inflows and outflows
from multiple sources in order to derive a cash forecast.

* Cash movement. It can originate electronic funds transfers.

¢ Debt tracking. It can follow short-term debt with a link to a dealer-based
commercial paper program.

¢ Financial exposure. It can identify and quantify financial exposure.

¢ Foreign exchange. It can determine a company’s cash positions in any cur-
rency.

¢ Investment tracking. It can track and summarize a company’s investment
positions in money markets, mutual funds, short-term and fixed-income
investments, equities, and options.

¢ Risk analysis. It allows an employee to use it as a giant calculator, perform-
ing “what if” analyses with yield-curve manipulation and scenario analysis.

Based on this lengthy list, it is evident that a large company can derive a suf-
ficient benefit from a treasury workstation to offset its substantial cost. For more

11-20 OPTIMIZE CASH MANAGEMENT DECISIONS
THROUGH THE INTERNET

The accounting and finance staff is confronted with a daily quandary — what to do
with any excess cash that is spun off by operations? Should it go into a simple
money market account, or perhaps commercial paper? How long should the
investment periods cover—1 day, 10 days, a few months? The people doing the
daily investing rarely have enough time to make these determinations, and do not
try to—they have generally settled into the use of a few tried-and-true investments
that cover the same investment period. In short, the same investment strategy is
used all the time, even if there is a better approach for making investments that
will result in more interest income.

There is a better way, and it can be found at www.treasurypoint.com. This
Web site contains an analytical tool called the Optimizer that reviews a wide array
of investment choices, using as inputs a company’s current cash position, its short-
term (up to 90 days) cash forecast, and a user-updated set of risk criteria. It then
spends from 5 to 15 minutes churning through thousands of possible investment
variations, guided by a rules-based expert system, before arriving at an optimal
set of investments that will yield the best possible return, given a user’s invest-
ment criteria. The Optimizer makes no attempt at estimating short-term changes
in interest rates; instead, it bases all calculations on current rates, thereby avoid-
ing any risk due to incorrect estimations. These investment choices will vary
daily based on the current interest rate structure of the market and changes in user
cash positions, so the investing staff should access the site every day to glean new
recommendations.

11-21 OPTIMIZE THE ORGANIZATION OF
TREASURY OPERATIONS

A large multinational company typically became large at least in part through
acquisitions, which leaves it with a complex set of banking relationships and
accounts, as well as a highly dispersed treasury management group that resides in
a multitude of locations. This results in the inefficient use of cash, which in turn
reduces interest income and does not allow a company to pay down the optimal
amount of debt.


11-22 Process Foreign Exchange Transactions over the Internet 223

These problems can be mitigated by implementing regional treasury manage-
ment centers, usually one per continent. By doing so, the treasurer can concen-
trate those treasury staff with the highest levels of expertise in the same locations,
while also achieving a much higher level of control over the underlying cash
pooling and foreign exchange transactions, not to mention better clerical tracking
of any resulting intercompany loans. By concentrating activities into this smaller
number of regional treasury centers, the treasurer can also more easily obtain on-
line access to the overall status of cash flows for the entire company.

The price of this increased level of efficiency is a considerable amount of
resistance by individual companies within the corporate conglomerate, since local
controllers and chief financial officers will be reluctant to hand over the adminis-
tration of their cash flows to a regional center that is outside of their control. Also,
such a high level of cash management calls for centralized information flows that
can only be provided by a companywide enterprise resource planning (ERP) sys-
tem, which is an extremely expensive system to purchase and install. Consequently,
the multinational optimization of treasury activities is so expensive that it is a rea-
sonable option only for the largest companies.

11-22 PROCESS FOREIGN EXCHANGE
TRANSACTIONS OVER THE INTERNET V Author’s Choice

Companies typically purchase or sell spot or forward contracts in foreign curren-
cies in order to hedge their transaction activities that involve other currencies.
However, this is a labor-intensive process involving calls to several banks to see
which ones quote the best price. In many cases, the accounting staff simply does
not have time to make a number of calls, and so chooses by default to deal with
the same bank every time, thereby sidestepping the chance to obtain lower prices
on its foreign exchange transactions. In addition, the incidence of errors in orders
placed by phone is high, due to communication or transcription problems.

These problems can be avoided through the use of an Internet-based foreign
exchange transaction site, such as www.currenex.com or www.gaincapital.com.
These sophisticated trading sites allow one to request prices from multiple banks
that provide executable live quotes using a reverse auction method. Under this
approach, banks offering quotes know the identity of the trader, but do not know
which other banks are bidding. This method results in the best price for a trader,
and in addition yields great efficiency in the trading process, since there is no need
to waste time making multiple phone calls to banks to obtain a range of quotes.

These on-line systems have other advantages, too. For example, one can
download information about a completed trade into the corporate treasury man-
agement system, as well as create audit reports detailing the results of each trans-
action. It is also possible to create reports that summarize trading patterns and


224 Finance Best Practices

transaction reports with banks, as well as print or download trade ticket informa-
tion. There are also no transactional errors, since the Web site automatically
matches and stores the financial and settlement details for each party to a foreign
exchange transaction. Also, most sites give traders access to research, analytical
tools, and current news reports. Further, some sites offer customization of the
interface, so that one can see only specific fields, create templates for repetitive
trades, and modify standard reports. It is even possible to use instant messaging
between both parties to a transaction! In short, there is a wide array of advantages
to these excellent sites that make them a clear improvement over other methods
for completing foreign exchange transactions.

Financial Statements
Best Practices

This chapter covers the best practices that can be used to issue financial state-
ments more rapidly. This creation process can be one of the most convoluted and
time-consuming of all activities, with a long time needed to complete a quality
set of statements. When a long interval is regularly required to complete financial
statements, it has two significant impacts: not allowing any time for the account-
ing staff to complete other activities, and an irate management team that never
receives its information on time. These are serious problems that can be com-
pletely eliminated by the best practices noted in this chapter.

The primary purpose of the two dozen improvement suggestions in this
chapter is to streamline the entire process of financial statement production. This
is done in a variety of ways, such as completing some tasks before the end of the
month, avoiding the bank reconciliation, and automating the month-end cutoff
process. Most of these steps are simple ones and can be quickly and easily
inserted into the existing process. A few, however, such as automating the period-
end cutoff, require a significant amount of extra work and may carry some risk of
providing imperfect financial information. Consequently, it is necessary to review
each recommended best practice carefully and only use those that will most eas-
ily be inserted into the existing system without causing either a stoppage in finan-
cial statement production or a reduction in their quality.

This chapter begins with a brief analysis of the level of implementation diffi-
culty for each of the best practices, proceeds to a detailed review of each one, and
finishes with an overview of how most of them can be grouped together into a
highly efficient financial statement production process.

people within the accounting department, which makes it a simple matter to alter
the tasks of just that small group. Also, these are mostly procedural changes, ones
that do not require expensive and problematic computer programming alter-
ations. Further, there is little need for the participation of other departments.
Thus, for all these reasons, the risk and investment associated with most of these
best practices are low.

The two glaring exceptions are automating the period-end cutoff and using
inventory cycle counting to avoid month-end inventory counts. In the first case,
there is a need for programming; and in both cases, the complete cooperation of
the warehouse staff is required. Given these two additional variables, these best
practices become not only the most expensive and time-consuming ones to
implement, but also the ones that are most likely to fail.

However, with these two exceptions, best practices for the production of
financial statements are generally easy to implement.

12-1 MOVE OPERATING DATA TO
OTHER REPORTS WV Author’s Choice

A major factor in the delay in sending financial statements is the inclusion of
operating data in the statements. The reason is that this information, such as scrap
rates or employee turnover, is not contained in the financial information that the
accounting staff normally deals with, nor is it readily obtained by creating ratios
or comparisons of the financial data. In short, this information can be hard to
obtain. The situation is worsened by the lack of control of the accounting staff
over who tracks the information, as well as its accuracy once it is obtained. For
example, a subsidiary may forward information about its customer backlog that
seems suspiciously high; the controller has the options of including the provided
data in the financial statements or of holding off on the financial statement distri-
bution while requesting and waiting for a review of the numbers by the sub-
sidiary — which is under no obligation to do the review. Thus, including operating
data in the financial statements not only can delay the issuance of the statements,
but also does nothing to ensure the accuracy of the operating information.


228 Financial Statements Best Practices

An easy way to avoid these problems is to separate all operating information
from the financial statements so the statements can be issued in a timely manner,
with the operating information sent out later in a separate document. By using
this approach, there are fewer steps to complete when issuing financial state-
ments, leaving fewer steps to delay the overall process. Also, if there are prob-
lems with the operating data, the controller can review the information at his or
her leisure and verify that the information is correct before releasing it. Not only
is this an easy best practice to implement, but it is also one that has no associated
expense.

12-2 POST FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN AN EXCEL
PIVOTTABLE ON THE INTERNET

A number of companies have found that an effective way to increase investor
knowledge of their activities is to post their financial statements on their Web
sites. These tend to be a summary-level duplication of the most recent quarterly
or annual results, as well as any accompanying financial notes. Though this is
certainly a good way to communicate with investors, the concept can be taken a
step further by loading the financial information into an Excel PivotTable, which
is essentially a three-dimensional spreadsheet that reveals different layers of
information to the user. By using a PivotTable, a reader of a financial statement
can access the results for multiple years, or even different lines of business,
within a summary-level financial statement. A good example of this layout can be
found in the Investor Relations section of the Microsoft Web site. This is a rela-
tively easy best practice to implement. The only downside is that investors must
download the file, which creates the highly unlikely, yet possible, risk of import-
ing a computer virus through the spreadsheet file.

12-3 RESTRICT THE LEVEL OF REPORTING

Over time, many older companies have gradually gotten into the habit of demand-
ing (and receiving) immensely detailed financial statements from the accounting
department. Besides the usual balance sheet and income statement, as well as
departmental reports, there can be a plethora of additional schedules, such as
sales by customer or region, inventory levels by type of inventory, and a complete
activity-based costing analysis of every customer. Though some of these reports
may be set up to run automatically as part of the regular package of financial
statements (and thereby requiring no additional work), other reports may require


12-4 Write Financial Statement Footnotes in Advance 229

the transfer of information to a different format, such as an electronic spread-
sheet, for further analysis and regrouping into a customized report. In this case,
the amount of time required to assemble and independently prepare the reports
may exceed the time needed to create the primary financial statements. Thus, the
more reports included in the financial statements, the more time it takes to issue
the statements.

The best way to avoid this problem is to make a list of all the reports
included in the financial statements, ignore those that are automatically created
by the accounting software, and focus on eliminating or delaying those that are
created separately. It may be possible to strip these reports out of the basic finan-
cial reporting package, allowing the accounting staff to issue the basic underlying
statements much more quickly. To achieve this goal, it may be necessary to
explain to management that the reports will no longer be provided at all (which is
normally not received well). Other variations are to issue the reports separately
and at a later date, or to issue them less frequently, such as once a quarter or year.
Usually, there is some combination of methods that will be agreeable to manage-
ment, thereby allowing a controller to restrict the level of reporting in the finan-
cial statements to only the most basic information.

Management may take a better view of this reduction in the information pro-
vided if the controller or CFO makes it known that, while information will be
delayed, other information will be provided more frequently in order to meet the
operating needs of the company. For example, the accounting department could
promise daily access to information about changes in revenues, discounts given
to customers, and expenses, and weekly access to changes in headcount informa-
tion. By providing this information so rapidly, it reduces the negative impact of
restricting some information from the financial statements, while also providing a
service by issuing key information even sooner than it had previously been
issued.

12-4 WRITE FINANCIAL STATEMENT FOOTNOTES IN ADVANCE

There are many footnotes that accompany a well-documented set of financial state-
ments. These typically include an executive summary, notes on the accounting
methodologies, the amount of long-term debt (as well as the years in which it
comes due), a commentary on insurance coverage, any customers with a high pre-
ponderance of a company’s sales, and a historical comparison of the current results
to prior years. Depending on the number of footnotes added to the financial state-
ment package, this can be a considerable amount of work to update every period.
The best way to avoid much of the work required to create footnotes is to
separate them into two categories: boilerplate information that is rarely changed,
and information that is closely linked to current financial results, requiring a great


230 Financial Statements Best Practices

deal of updating. All footnotes in the first category should be clustered together to
the greatest extent possible, reviewed prior to the end of the month, and even
printed out and ready for inclusion with the remainder of the financial statements.
By handling these items well in advance, there is less work to be done during the
crucial period immediately following the end of a reporting period, when there is
little time available for such work. Unfortunately, many footnotes do require
updates based on current financial results and so cannot be completed in advance.
In these cases, it is still possible to highlight those portions of each footnote that
must be changed, either with different font sizes, underlining, or color changes in
the computer, so that everything requiring examination can be spotted and
checked easily. In addition, it is a good idea to create a checklist containing all of
the data to be updated in each footnote. This checklist is an excellent way to
avoid situations where footnotes are distributed that have not been updated to
account for the most recent results.

12-5 AUTOMATE RECURRING JOURNAL ENTRIES

The average financial statement many require several dozen journal entries
before it is completed. Some of these entries can be quite large, perhaps to
redistribute payroll costs to a large number of departments or to allocate occu-
pancy costs in a similar manner. If they are substantial, it is easy to incorrectly
enter them occasionally, resulting in revenues and expenses being sent to the
wrong accounts, making the financial statements very difficult to compare from
month to month. If the journal entries have been highly inconsistent over time,
it may even be necessary for the general ledger accountant to review all of them
and create new journal entries to correct the original entries. All of this work
takes time, of course—and time is in short supply during the financial state-
ment closing process.

Many general ledger accounting software packages have a feature that
allows one to avoid the continual reentry of journal entries every month by set-
ting up recurring journal entries which the system will automatically generate
every month, with no further manual interference. This type of entry is only for
those situations where the exact amounts of the entries do not change from month
to month (e.g., for the allocation of occupancy costs), so it will only apply to a
portion of the total number of journal entries. Nonetheless, by setting up recur-
ring entries in the computer, there are fewer journal entries to make.

The only problem with using recurring entries is that they will change at
long intervals, necessitating a periodic update. To use the earlier example, occu-
pancy costs may be reallocated based on changes in the square footage occupied
by each department, so the closing schedule should include an annual review and
updating of the amounts used in this entry. Another way to update recurring


12-6 Automate the Cutoff 231

entries is to create a schedule of entry updates, so a controller knows the exact
month or year in which a recurring entry is scheduled to change and can ignore it
in the meantime. Either approach gives a sufficient amount of control over this
type of journal entry, while still reducing the total amount of accounting time
allocated to it.

Cost: SS Installation time:

12-6 AUTOMATE THE CUTOFF

The single most difficult issue at the time of each financial statement closing is
the cutoff. This involves matching the invoices from suppliers with receipts to
ensure that all expenses carry with them a corresponding benefit within the same
period. The main problem in this area is the cost of goods sold, where large quan-
tities of goods are received every day, usually comprising the bulk of all expendi-
tures. If even a single high-value delivery is recorded in the wrong period, the
cost of goods sold can be off significantly, either too high, because an expense is
recorded without the corresponding receipt, or vice versa. To exacerbate the
problem, the incorrect entry will reverse itself in the following accounting period,
resulting in a continual fluctuation in the cost of goods sold, one period being too
high and the next too low. This can be very embarrassing for a controller and is a
grave matter for publicly held companies, which can be sued by shareholders for
incorrectly reporting financial results. To avoid this problem, most controllers
allocate an inordinate amount of manpower to the comparison of accounts
payable and inventory records.

To avoid the entire cutoff problem, it is absolutely mandatory that a company
strictly adhere to a policy of turning away from the receiving dock any deliveries
that do not have an accompanying purchase order number. By closely following
this policy, it is possible to entirely automate the period-end cutoff. The reason
why automation then becomes easy is that by immediately logging in all receipts
against purchase orders in the computer system (thus the additional need for
immediate data entry), it is possible to generate a computer report that compares
all inventory receipts to the purchase orders entered into the computer system, as
well as all received supplier invoices that match up against the purchase orders.
The net result of this report is a complete list of all receipts for which there are no
supplier invoices, making it a simple matter to accrue for all missing invoices.
This carries with it the double benefits of not only avoiding the manual labor of
determining a clean cutoff, but also eliminating the wait time that would other-
wise be required before supplier invoices arrive.

Unfortunately, there are several problems with this excellent approach that
limit a controller’s ability to install it. One is that it requires the cooperation of
the computer services and warehousing departments—the first to program the
changes needed to make it run in the computer system and the latter to agree to


232 Financial Statements Best Practices

reject all items without purchase orders, as well as to enter all receipts in a com-
puter at the receiving dock. Whenever additional departments are involved, the
chances of completion drop, since there are more supervisors who can interfere
with it. Also, due to the programming needs, this is an expensive implementation
(unless there is already a packaged software solution on hand that contains the
appropriate features). Further, the purchasing department must be persuaded to
enter all purchase orders into the computer system in a timely manner. All of
these issues, particularly the involvement of multiple departments, makes this a
difficult and expensive best practice to implement, though it is also one of the
most rewarding ones to have in place.

12-7 AVOID THE BANK RECONCILIATION

The last item completed before issuing financial statements is usually the bank
reconciliation. A company’s bank takes a few days to compile bank statements
for all of its customers following the end of the month, then a few more days pass
while the statement travels through the mail. The typical company then receives it
on about the fifth business day of the month, and someone in the accounting
department must scramble to complete the bank reconciliation. Usually, there are
bank fees noted on the statement that must be recorded on a company’s books, as
well as any unrecorded checks (always manual ones that were never entered into
the computer system) that must be recorded. Because of the delay built into
receiving the statement and the time needed to complete the bank reconciliation,
many companies cannot reduce the time needed to complete their financial state-
ments to less than five or six days.

To reduce the time needed to produce financial statements, one must not
include the bank reconciliation in the month-end closing procedure. By doing so,
there is no need to wait for the bank statement to arrive, nor is there any last-
minute rush to complete the bank reconciliation.

However, there is a significant risk to consider, which can be greatly miti-
gated. The risk is that there is an expense located on the bank statement that, if
not recorded, will have a major impact on the level of reported profits in the
financial statements. For example, a large manual check representing a major
expense is listed on the bank statement as having been processed; this check
will eliminate all monthly profits when recorded in the general ledger. This
possibility is the main reason why many controllers insist on waiting for the
bank reconciliation to be completed before they will consider issuing financial
statements. Luckily, there are several steps one can take to reduce this risk. One
is to accrue banking fees. These are usually about the same amount each month
and so can be accrued and then reversed after the actual bank statement arrives.
Second, one can call the bank and advance the date on which the bank statement


12-8 Defer Routine Work 233

is issued, say to the 25th day of the month, which allows the accounting staff to
complete the bank reconciliation much sooner, though there is still a risk that
the final few days of the month may contain an unrecorded expense that will
not be found until the following month’s bank statement. Also, the outside
auditors will object to a bank statement that does not extend to the last day of
the month, so the final statement of the year must be converted back to the tra-
ditional month-end variety. Third and best, the accounting staff can subscribe
to its bank’s on-line transaction review system (assuming it has one), which
allows someone to review all checks received every day and to maintain a run-
ning bank reconciliation. By using this final approach, the bank reconciliation
is always perfect and all expenses are spotted on the same day they are
recorded by the bank. As a result, there is no need to worry about unexplained
expenses appearing on the bank statement and the reconciliation can safely be
shifted out of those few frenzied days when the financial statements are being
produced. Though any of the three variations noted in this paragraph can be
used, only the last one is a completely foolproof way to avoid missing some-
thing on a bank statement that should be recorded as a current expense.

12-8 DEFER ROUTINE WORK

An accounting department is usually overwhelmed by its ongoing volume of
work, without the extra crushing load of creating and distributing the periodic
financial statements. Many of these tasks, such as payments to suppliers, invoic-
ing to customers, daily or weekly reports to management, or the processing of
cash, are vital ones, and cannot be delayed for long. As a result, the accounting
staff is accustomed to working long overtime hours during the first week of each
month, not to mention a blackout on vacation time during this period. Also, the
following week is sometimes a frenzied one as well, since the accounting depart-
ment must catch up on the necessary work it did not quite have a chance to com-
plete in the previous week. In short, producing the financial statements is a hard
lump for the accounting department to swallow.

The solution is to carefully review the tasks currently scheduled for comple-
tion during the first week of the month and see if there are ways to eliminate them
or shift them into a (much) later week. For example, management may be accus-
tomed to receiving a daily report of sales and cash receipts; it may be possible to
completely eliminate this report for a few days during the beginning of the month
so that the workload is completely eliminated, rather than being shifted into the
next week. Completely avoiding work is always the best option, but for some
tasks, there is no alternative to shifting it forward a few days. Examples of this
kind are paying suppliers or billing customers—this must be done, but a judi-
cious delay of a few days will not do an excessive amount of harm to these basic


234 Financial Statements Best Practices

processes. However, there may be a few cases, such as invoicing very large dollar
amounts or paying suppliers in order to take a large early payment discount,
where it pays to go ahead with the work in the current period, but only for key
items; the remaining smaller items can still be deferred for a short time. This
solution is an easy way to reduce the amount of overtime required to complete
the financial statements.

Cost: aS Installation time:

12-9 ELIMINATE MULTIPLE APPROVALS

A typical problem when financial statements are produced is to have employees
wait for approvals before they are allowed to complete their tasks, or to pass
along work to other employees, who cannot begin until the approvals are given.
When there are many approvals to obtain, especially in areas where the approvals
are holding up key work products, there can be a substantial impact on the speed
of financial statement completion. Typical spots in the financial statement process
that include approvals are journal entries, footnotes, the final version of the state-
ments, and the final results from all of the major accounting modules: accounts
payable, accounts receivable, payroll, and fixed assets. Given the number of
approvals in some companies, it is a wonder that the financial statements are ever
produced in less than a month.

There are several solutions that bypass the approvals problem. When reviewing
them, one must consider the underlying reason for using approvals, which is to
ensure that information is correctly processed. Without an approval, there must be a
countervailing system in place to ensure that accurate information is still transmitted
to the financial statements. Some solutions to the approvals dilemma are as follows:

¢ Designate a back-up approver. If there is a continuing problem with finding
the person who is allowed to issue approvals, then there should be a back-up
approver available. This should still be a person who has a sufficient level of
technical expertise, and so this solution is only a viable option for those com-
panies with some extra employees on hand who are sufficiently qualified.

¢ Increase training levels. An excellent way to avoid approvals is to train the
accounting staff in the closing procedures so that they all become experts in
their jobs. After heavy and repeated training, it is quite common to find that
the staff is more technically proficient in their tasks than their bosses, with
little need for any approval. Also, newcomers to the accounting department
must receive similarly high levels of indoctrination.

¢ Issue ranges within which approvals are not required. The best way to handle
the approval problem is not to require approvals at all. To do so, determine the
comfort level of the controller in regard to how much an accountant is allowed
to do without any supervisory review. For example, one can establish a limit


12-10 Eliminate Small Accruals 235

of $2,500 for any journal entry, above which approvals are still required. This
approach usually eliminates the bulk of the approvals, while still reserving the
oversight privilege for those transactions that are large enough to truly warrant
a review. This method usually requires a periodic review of all transactions
to ensure that the preset ranges are being observed.

¢ Reduce to one approver. In cases where there is more than one approver, there
is rarely a need for it. For example, if a journal entry for more than $5,000
must be approved by an assistant controller, but anything over $25,000
requires the approval of the controller, it is usually sufficient to give the
assistant controller a much higher signoff authority, reserving only the most
unusual situations for the involvement of the extra person. If a controller still
insists on requiring a secondary review of all approvals, then either the con-
troller is a certifiable micromanager (which may require counseling) or else
the person issuing the first approval is not sufficiently qualified to give it (in
which case he or she should have no approval authority at all).

¢ Shift the approver to an available person. A common occurrence is that a
high-ranking person is the only one allowed to approve certain transac-
tions. If that person is commonly traveling or in meetings, then a process
cannot be completed until the person becomes available to give an
approval. Consequently, the best approach is to reassign the approval to a
different person who is always on-site, usually an assistant controller or
accounting manager.

All of these approaches are targeted at reducing the processing time required
to track down a designated approver. Given a company’s individual circum-
stances, especially involving the risks of not approving a processing step, the
ultimate solution to this problem will be a mix of these solutions. The key issue
to remember is that some situations do indeed require some kind of supervisory
control, so there is always some approval requirement for at least a few key
deliverables.

12-10 ELIMINATE SMALL ACCRUALS

In some companies, there is a focus on achieving perfectly accurate financial
statements, no matter how many extra accruals are needed to ensure that expenses
are recorded absolutely perfectly. Though there is a certain degree of professional
satisfaction in issuing a set of absolutely accurate financial statements, this can
use up a considerable amount of accounting resources, which could be better
used elsewhere. For example, it may require 20 extra accruals, along with the
attendant analysis, review, and approval effort, to yield financial statements that
now have a profit altered by one or two percentage points. Realistically, such a


236 Financial Statements Best Practices

slight change in the financial results will not have a noticeable impact on the
decision making of the managers, stock analysts, or creditors who review the
financial statements. So, despite an inordinate amount of extra effort, no one
really cares about the slightly more accurate results.

The answer to this problem is to review all existing accruals and throw out
all of the ones that result in only very small accrual amounts. By doing so, less
time is needed to produce the financial statements, opening up resources for other
uses. However, when conducting the accrual review, it is important to check on a
number of past journal entries to ensure that each accrual is always a small one—
if there is even a slight chance of an accrual occasionally being a large one, it is
best to keep it in place on the grounds that financial statement accuracy could be
severely impacted by its absence at some point in the future. Thus, as long as an
appropriate degree of caution is used when eliminating accruals from the finan-
cial statement closing procedure, it is reasonable to permanently eliminate the
use of small accruals.

Cost: aS Installation time:

12-11 REDUCE INVESTIGATION LEVELS

Before issuing the financial statements, they are subject to an intensive review
by the controller, who compares each line item to the budgeted level and thor-
oughly investigates each item that varies significantly from the budget. This is
an admirable and necessary practice, since it catches errors and also prepares the
controller for any questions from the management team regarding those same
variances. However, the practice can be taken too far. For example, it is almost
impossible for any revenue or expense line item to match exactly the budgeted
amount (unless it is related to a long-term contract that ensures totally pre-
dictable amounts), so a controller who investigates virtually all variances will be
doomed to review every line item in the general ledger. This is an enormous task
and also an unnecessary one, for the vast majority of variances are so small that
there is no point in reviewing them—even if there is an error somewhere, the
total impact is so insignificant that there will be no noticeable impact on corpo-
rate profitability.

A very simple best practice that eliminates the bulk of this review work is
to reduce investigation levels to the point where only the largest variances are
checked for accuracy. This can take several forms. For example, a minimum
dollar amount, such as $10,000, can be set for the amount of a variance that a
controller will bother to investigate. Alternatively, it can be on a percentage
basis, such as anything over a 30 percent variance. Also, there may be some
accounts, such as payroll, that are better reviewed by checking headcount fig-
ures each month, thereby entirely eliminating them from the variance analysis.
The best approach is usually a combination of all three techniques, which means


12-12 Assign Closing Responsibilities 237

that anything over a specific dollar variance is always reviewed, plus any large
percentage variances that may fall under the preset dollar level, with the excep-
tion of certain accounts reviewed in other ways. This system can then be modified
over time to allow for changes in the controller’s comfort level with variance
investigation, as well as to cover new accounts that may be added. By creating
such a system of variance review levels, it is possible to greatly reduce the amount
of review work that must be completed prior to issuing financial statements.

12-12 ASSIGN CLOSING RESPONSIBILITIES WV Author’s Choice

The typical financial statement preparation process can be a jumbled affair. It is
not clear who is completing which task or when anything needs to be completed.
This leads to disarray in the ranks of the accounting staff whenever the financial
statements are to be produced.

A simple best practice is to produce a document that clearly states exactly
who is responsible for each task required to produce financial statements. As
noted in Exhibit 12.2, it states the job position that must complete each task. In
order to fully utilize this document, it is necessary to have a staff meeting prior to
each closing period so the controller can go over the closing responsibilities. This
reinforces the need for each person to complete each task exactly on time, so the
accounting team can reliably issue financial statements every period. When com-
bined with a detailed closing schedule, as described later in this chapter under the

12-13 CONDUCT TRANSACTION TRAINING

Once the preliminary financial statements have been completed, the controller
must carefully review all expense, revenue, and balance sheet items to see if there
are unusual variances, investigate all of them, and make corrections that result in
an accurate financial statement. Depending on the number of errors and the time
it takes to research them, this error-checking phase can seriously extend the time
required before financial statements are produced.

The best practice to eliminate a large number of these errors is to conduct
detailed transaction training for all employees who have a role in entering trans-
actions into the computer system (typically a sizeable group). The reason for
doing this is that the controller’s final review of the financial statements is only a
method for removing errors after they have already been made; by eliminating
these errors before they happen through proper training, the number of errors that
the controller must later research will drop dramatically.

The training must be very specifically targeted at eliminating recurring errors.
This is done through a feedback loop. All errors discovered in the financial state-
ments should be noted in a log, along with the name and position of the person
most likely to have caused the error. This information is reviewed each month,
and a short training program is created, targeted both at the specific person who
made the mistake and the type of error that occurred; if the error appears to be a
common one for many employees to make, the training can be given to everyone
who enters the same transaction. Also, the training programs may be used to update
the initial training that all employees receive in transaction processing, thereby
avoiding errors in the initial training program. Mandatory reinforcement training
is also useful, both as a reminder for experienced staff and as a part of the core
training for new recruits, thereby keeping the focus on error reduction over the
long term.

The main problem with this approach is the cost of training. If there are
many people entering transactions, the training required to cover all of them can
be considerable. In these cases, it may be necessary to scale back to a small num-
ber of seminars per year, or else to issue bulletins describing problems, or to use
on-line training through the computer system. All of these approaches are less
expensive than comprehensive and frequent training, but are also less effective.
At worst, there should be a follow-up program with the specific individuals who
make errors, so the worst offenders can be targeted for immediate improvement.
Also, some of the people who need training may work for other departments, so
the controller may have to exercise some tact in asking other department heads

for permission to repeatedly train their employees. However, these issues are
minor ones, given the benefits of reduced transaction error rates.

12-14 CONTINUALLY REVIEW WAIT TIMES

A lengthy financial statement completion process has a number of spots built into
it where there are long wait times. For example, the typical company waits five
days before it receives a bank statement from the bank for each of its accounts
necessary to complete a bank statement. Also, there is usually a wait of a few
days while supplier invoices arrive, just to make sure that all expenses have been
properly recorded. It is pauses like these that make it nearly impossible to issue
financial statements in a rapid manner, no matter how quickly all other tasks are
completed. For example, it may be possible to blaze through a bank reconcilia-
tion in an hour, but if one is still waiting five days to receive the bank statement,
one is focusing on the speed of the wrong activity.

The best practice that helps to resolve this issue is a continual review of wait
times. This focuses attention on those activities a controller should really be
attempting to reduce in size or eliminate. To review wait times, the best tool is a
Gantt chart. This shows the typical start and stop dates for each closing activity.
By closely examining the start dates for each activity and questioning why those
dates cannot be accelerated, it brings attention to bear on any activities that are
dependent on the prior completion of other activities. However, this is only a tool
for pointing out where there are problems; it does not actually resolve them. To
use the example from earlier in this section, a Gantt chart will only tell a con-
troller that there is a substantial wait involved before all supplier invoices are
received—the controller must still do something about it (that particular item is
addressed in the “Automate the Cutoff” section earlier in this chapter).

There are no problems with using this best practice, for it is easily imple-
mented, requiring only a brief review by the controller after each financial state-
ment closing to determine if there have been any wait-time changes. It also needs
no programming and does not involve other departments. In short, it is a simple
best practice to install and provides valuable information for the targeting of fur-
ther improvements.

12-15 CONVERT SERIAL ACTIVITIES TO PARALLEL ONES

A common problem, especially in smaller accounting departments, is that a con-
siderable amount of wait time is built into the process because there are too many


240 Financial Statements Best Practices

activities being conducted in a serial manner—that is, one process does not start
until another is finished. A good example is in a small organization where just
one person is in charge of completing several processing steps and does not have
time to advance to additional tasks until the first one is complete. The same prob-
lem occurs in large organizations but usually not due to a lack of manpower.
Instead, the information that flows into one process must be supplied by another
task, so the preceding step must be completely finished before the next one can
be started. These issues create a great deal of difficulty in reducing the time
needed to complete financial statements.

The best practice that eliminates serial activities is to convert them into
parallel ones. A parallel activity is one which can be completed without any
need for data from a preceding process. An example of several parallel closing
activities is shown in Exhibit 12.3, which depicts the accounts receivable,
accounts payable, fixed assets, and payroll processes. Only in one case, where
the final detail of the accounts payable process is needed as the starting point
for the fixed assets process, is there any linkage between the separate
processes. The trick to making this best practice work is to separate the individ-
ual processes that make up a financial statement closing so that they can be
independently processed. An example of this is using a preliminary set of
financial statements as the input into an allocation base from which occupancy
costs are allocated to various departments. By using older information in the
allocation base (see the “Complete Allocation Bases in Advance” section later
in this chapter), there is no longer a linkage between the two processes, so that
they can now be processed as parallel activities. Similarly, the accounts payable
function is not normally closed until several days have passed, while the com-
pany waits for a few supplier invoices to arrive. This serial processing issue is
readily avoided by using computer systems and real-time entry of receipts at
the warehouse (see the ‘“‘Automate the Cutoff” section earlier in this chapter) to
create an accrual for all missing supplier invoices without waiting for the actual
invoices to arrive. Conducting a comprehensive review of all closing activities
and systematically converting serial activities into parallel ones is one of the
best ways to reduce the time needed to produce financial statements.

12-16 CREATE A CLOSING SCHEDULE WV Author’s Choice

The worst enemy of a financial statement process is a disorganized closing. With-
out a sufficiently detailed procedure, no one will know when any deliverables are
needed or if some deliverables are needed at all. Further, there is no sequence to
the process so some steps are waiting for the completion of previous steps that no
one is working on. For example, the accounts payable module must be completed
before anyone can complete the fixed assets module since it is possible to over-


12-16 Create a Closing Schedule 241

look last-minute fixed asset additions if some of the accounts payable have not
been entered. A disorganized closing can drastically delay the completion of
financial statements.

The best practice that resolves this issue is to create a closing schedule such as
the one shown in Exhibit 12.4. This schedule itemizes all tasks that must be com-
pleted during each day of the closing process. By creating such a schedule, it is
immediately obvious when all tasks must be completed so that the controller can
follow up with employees and apply extra resources to those tasks that are falling
behind the schedule. Please note that a number of activities scheduled in Exhibit
12.4 should be completed prior to the end of the reporting period, leaving much
less work to do at the end of the process. This schedule is most effective when com-
bined with a schedule of responsibilities, such as the one noted earlier in Exhibit
12.2. The two schedules can even be combined so that the name or title of the
responsible person is listed at the beginning of each activity in the closing schedule.

The only issue with creating a closing schedule is that it is a constantly chang-
ing document requiring regular updating and communication to the accounting
staff. The reason for the regular updates is that the schedule will initially allow for a
substantial number of days before statements are completed, but management will
gradually shrink the number of days, requiring a constant reshuffling of tasks and
responsibilities. The accounting staff will only follow changes to the schedule if the
alterations are clearly communicated to them. In particular, the controller must lis-
ten to their objections regarding a reduction in the time to complete tasks so their
requirements can be incorporated into the schedule. As long as these factors are
considered, the closing schedule becomes the foundation document that drives the
timely completion of the financial statements.

12-17 DOCUMENT THE PROCESS

Some organizations have created closing procedures and established responsibil-
ities for those accounting people who are involved with the production of finan-
cial statements, which helps them to some degree in organizing the flow of work.
However, they meet with great resistance when they take the next step and man-
date reductions in the time needed to complete the statements. Employees grouse
that there is not enough time to complete their work, that upstream work is not
completed on time (which does not allow them to start their tasks on time), and
that management does not know all the details required to complete their tasks.
As a result, though the process appears to be more organized, there is no way to
reduce the time and resources allocated to it.

The underlying reason why this problem arises is that the employees are
right—the managers who are driving for shorter completion dates do not really
know the process and cannot understand the plethora of additional necessary
changes before the process will become truly streamlined. The only way to avoid
this quagmire is to document the process thoroughly. This means that a team must
interview all employees who are involved in the reporting process, write down


244 Financial Statements Best Practices

detailed descriptions of what they do, and flowchart all activities. Only after these
steps are completed can one see the bottlenecks in the process that must be elimi-
nated. For example, an employee may be using a painfully slow allocation method
for spreading occupancy costs, which can be easily altered by switching to a sim-
pler method—but a controller will never know this without a complete documen-
tation of exactly how the current allocation calculation is made. The documenta-
tion process can be a slow one, especially for a multidivision company including
many employees and locations in the process. Nonetheless, it is the only way to
gain a better understanding of the process, which leads to better decisions regard-
ing how other best practices can be inserted to ensure better results.

It is possible to short-circuit some of the documentation process. The best way
is to determine which people in the process are causing the obvious bottlenecks,
since the work seems to pile up at their desks. Their work should be documented
and acted on first, while the efforts of others, whose work products are clearly com-
ing in on time, can wait until any changes alter the process enough to make them
the cause of the new bottlenecks. By using this variation on the documentation
process, it is possible to more rapidly institute changes to the overall process.

12-18 RESTRICT THE USE OF JOURNAL ENTRIES

Journal entries can be the bane of the general ledger accountant who is desperately
trying to issue accurate financial statements. The reason is that in the midst of
cleaning up the general ledger in preparation for the issuance of financial state-
ments, this person will sometimes find that a journal entry has miraculously
appeared in the ledger, requiring a hurried investigation to determine who made the
entry, why it was made, and whether the entry was already duplicated by the gen-
eral ledger accountant. After this added work, there is always the chance that even
more entries will be made prior to the closing of the books for the reporting period.
A particularly irritating problem is when a journal entry is made between the time
when the financial statements are issued and the accounting period is closed in the
computer system, since the change appears in the beginning balance for the next
month, but does not show up in the financial statements! This can be an exceed-
ingly difficult item to trace. Thus, allowing multiple people to create journal entries
can lead to significant delays during the production of financial statements.

A much simpler approach is to restrict the task of making journal entries to a
single person, the general ledger accountant. Even the controller should not be
allowed to create journal entries. By using this approach, there is a single easily
controlled point of entry into the general ledger, ensuring that the information
entering the ledger has been verified in advance. The inevitable result will be
fewer problems with the production of financial statements.


12-19 Train the Staff in Closing Procedures 245

There are a few problems with this approach. Some accounting personnel
will probably complain that they are entitled to make journal entries, while there
may also be a problem if the general ledger accountant is not available at month-
end to make entries; if so, there should be a back-up person on hand authorized to
handle journal entries. Another issue for larger corporations is what to do if there
are a number of general ledger accountants, all of whom must make entries at the
same time, simply because of the volume of entries required. In this case, it is
necessary to maintain a log, either manually or in the computer, in which every
accountant must record all entries. By referring to other entries already in the log,
any of the general ledger accountants can easily see what entries have already
been made and can thereby avoid any duplicate entries.

12-19 TRAIN THE STAFF IN CLOSING PROCEDURES

One of the biggest problems with a new accounting staff, or one in which the
responsibilities for producing financial statements have changed recently, is that
they do not know what they are supposed to do. This results in a general level of
confusion regarding responsibilities, as well as the slow completion of deliver-
ables and their probable inaccuracy even when they are done. This is a nightmare
situation for a controller, who must review everyone’s work in great detail and
check on everyone’s progress to make sure that they will complete their assigned
tasks on time. This scenario is almost guaranteed to result in the late production
of financial statements, and probably ones with errors, as well.

A key factor that will reduce the level of confusion is proper training of the
accounting staff. By doing so, error rates will decline, while the time needed to
complete assigned tasks will drop dramatically. To achieve this end result, one
must first have an adequate set of procedures from which to conduct training (see
the ‘Document the Process” section earlier in this chapter). Once these proce-
dures are written, one can use them to conduct personalized training of every per-
son who is involved in the creation of financial statements. It is important to con-
duct training prior to the end of the reporting period so that the training can be
done in a leisurely manner, giving everyone time to ruminate over the informa-
tion and to have their questions answered thoroughly. If the training is conducted
in the midst of the closing process, there will not be enough time for an adequate
level of training. Also, once the initial training is complete, the controller must
still monitor the progress of all the people on the accounting team and provide
follow-up training as needed to ensure that they have fully absorbed what they
have been taught and that any errors are corrected. Finally, the procedures that
were used as a training tool must be given to the accounting staff for referral pur-
poses, as well as being updated at once to reflect any ongoing changes to the closing

procedure. Training is an extremely cost-effective method for ensuring that the
accounting staff completes the financial statements in an efficient and effective
manner.

12-20 USE CYCLE COUNTING TO AVOID
MONTH-END COUNTS WV Author’s Choice

A common effort for companies with poor inventory record-keeping systems is to
count the inventory at the end of every reporting period. By doing so, the con-
troller is assured of a reasonably accurate cost of goods sold figure, though at the
cost of shutting down the business while the counting process goes on (since this
may interfere with accurate inventory counts), which not only runs the risk of los-
ing some business, but also requires paying some employees to conduct the
decidedly not value-added inventory counting activity. Over the course of a year,
this represents either a major loss of revenue, addition to expenses, or both.

The solution is to stop taking periodic inventory counts. By doing so, there
is no stoppage of sales activities, nor is there any need to redirect anyone’s activ-
ities to counting inventory. In addition, the accounting staff no longer has to
spend valuable time during the end of the month to participate in the inventory
count, which gives the staff more time to complete the financial statements more
quickly. Unfortunately, this happy state of affairs brings with it some risks. The
main one is that inventory may become quite inaccurate over time, resulting in
cost-of-goods-sold numbers in the financial statements that will, over time,
depart quite a long way from the actual situation. If this number is inaccurate,
the borrowing base information a company presents to the bank will also proba-
bly be wrong, which may give the bank grounds for withholding additional bor-
rowings. A final problem is that if the financial statements are incorrect, the con-
troller may pay for this oversight by losing his or her job. The best way to avoid
all of these issues is to use cycle counting. This process involves a continual
count of the entire inventory so that all items, especially the high-value or high-
usage ones, have their quantities verified frequently. In addition, a trained cycle-
counter is much more likely to obtain accurate inventory figures than the less
knowledgeable group of counters typically employed for period-end counts. A
good cycle-counter is trained to investigate why there are counting variances,
resulting in changes to the underlying systems that originally caused the errors.
By using this approach, it is very unlikely that the inventory will be very far off
at any time, which gives a controller much greater confidence that the inventory
figures at the end of the month are accurate, without the need for a periodic
physical inventory count.

12-21 Use Internal Audits to Locate Transaction Problems in Advance 247

12-21 USE INTERNAL AUDITS TO LOCATE TRANSACTION
PROBLEMS IN ADVANCE

The financial statement is, in a manner of speaking, the cesspool into which all
corporate information flows—that is to say, all transaction errors will wend
their way into this final repository of corporate information. This means that
there can be a large concentration of incorrect data in the general ledger, which
unfortunately is the only source of information from which the financial state-
ments are created. Accordingly, poorly completed transactions upstream from
the general ledger will eventually appear in the financial statements. This
causes a great deal of extra work for the accounting staff, who must frantically
research all of the problems that were caused upstream from the financial state-
ments and issue journal entries to correct them—all in the few days during
which the statements must be completed and issued. This problem will occur
month after month unless something is done to find out where these problems
are occurring and why.

The internal auditing staff can be brought in to discover where these prob-
lems are occurring, why they are happening, who is causing the problems, and
what can be done to fix them. By using the internal auditing staff, the controller
can determine the exact nature of all the problems plaguing the financial state-
ments. Though this best practice does not solve the problems, it at least identi-
fies them, making it much easier for a controller to determine an appropriate
response to each one. The long-term result of this approach is a gradual reduc-
tion in the number of errors in the financial statements, resulting in much less
analysis time by the accounting staff to correct the preliminary version of the
financial statements.

The main problem with this best practice is caused by the internal audit
department and its controlling audit committee. The department recommends to
the audit committee (which is usually composed of members of the board of
directors) a set of investigative projects for the upcoming year, which the com-
mittee typically approves without much discussion. The department creates this
list based on the perceived payback from each potential audit, or because they
are in potentially high-risk areas. If the controller cannot get the transaction
review audit onto this annual project list (and repeatedly so, since this audit
must be repeated time and again), there is no way that the best practice can ever
be completed. It may take a considerable amount of influence with the internal
audit manager or the audit committee to make sure that these audits are regularly
conducted.

248 Financial Statements Best Practices

12-22 USE STANDARD JOURNAL
ENTRY FORMS WV Author’s Choice

The production of a typical set of financial statements requires the entry of a large
number of journal entries. These must be made for a variety of reasons that even the
best-run accounting department cannot avoid, such as cost allocations, accrued
expenses for which a supplier invoice has not yet arrived, or the shifting of an
expense to a different account than the one into which it was initially recorded.
Recording each one of these entries can take a considerable amount of time, for a
great deal of thought must go into which accounts are used, their account numbers,
the amounts of money to be recorded in each account, and whether there will be a
debit or credit entry. Consequently, the use of journal entries can take up a signifi-
cant amount of the total time required to produce financial statements.

One way to reduce the amount of time devoted to journal entries is to create
a standard set of journal entry forms. These are used for the recording of standard
journal entries where the amount of money to be recorded will vary, but the
account numbers will stay the same most of the time. An example of such an
entry is noted in Exhibit 12.5. This type of entry is a common one and probably
applies to a majority of the journal entries every month. This type of journal entry
standardization can also be taken a step further by creating recurring journal
entries, which can be used for any entries that have the exact same amount of
money in the entry every time. For more information on this approach, see the
“Automate Recurring Journal Entries” section earlier in this chapter.

Cost: SS Installation time:

12-23 COMPLETE ALLOCATION BASES IN ADVANCE

A number of expenses must be allocated among departments. These can include
occupancy, telephone, insurance, and other costs. For each allocation, there is
usually an allocation base. For example, occupancy may be based on the square
footage occupied by each department, while telephone costs are allocated based
on the number of employees in a department. For each allocation base, someone
in the accounting department must update all of the information based on the latest
financial results, prior to creating a journal entry to allocate the costs to various
departments. Because an allocation base usually includes the latest financial
information before a final cost allocation is made, it tends to be one of the last
action items the accounting department completes before it issues the financial
statements. Because it falls so late in the process, it can have a direct impact on
the total time required to issue financial statements.

The best practice that solves this issue is a straightforward one —use informa-
tion from the previous month as an allocation base. By doing so, there is no allo-
cation base to update in the midst of the frantic release of financial statements.

Instead, the update can be completed at everyone’s leisure, since it does not have
to be ready until the next month’s financial statements are put together. In case
there are any concerns regarding the relationship between the previous month’s
allocation base and the current month’s expenses to be distributed, one can always
release a study that shows the (almost invariably) minor changes in the allocation
base from month to month. An alternative approach that may quash any fears of
this sort is to use a three-month averaging allocation so that any unusual variations
in the monthly allocation base can be spread out. The only remaining problem is
the outside auditors, who may insist on an allocation base that uses information
from the end of the year; if so, the allocation base can be updated for the final
month of the fiscal year, but the system can revert to a previous-month system for
all other months of the year. This is an easy way to shift some of the workload
away from the busy days immediately following the end of an accounting period.

12-24 CONDUCT DAILY REVIEW OF THE
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Sometimes the initial review of the period-end financial statements comes as
quite a shock—the revenues or expenses may be wildly off from expectations.
This results in a great deal of frantic research, while the controller investigates
possible causes, rapidly makes changes, and issues bland statements to the rest of
the management team that the financial statements might be issued a bit late this
month. If the financials are indeed substantially different from what management
has been led to expect, the blame may even be pinned on the controller, who may
lose his or her job as a result.


250 Financial Statements Best Practices

The best way to avoid this problem is to conduct a daily review of the financial
statements. Yes, this means prior to the end of the month. By doing so, a controller
can review revenues as soon as they are billed, and expenses as soon as they are
incurred so that any obvious discrepancies can be resolved right away. In addition,
if there is a real problem with the financial results, the controller will know about it
immediately, rather than being taken by surprise at month-end, which carries the
additional benefit of being able to warn the management team immediately, setting
their expectations for the period-end financial results. Also, by finding and correct-
ing problems well in advance, there are hardly any issues left to deal with by the
end of the month, so the financial statements can be issued much more quickly.
Thus, a daily review enhances the controller’s knowledge of how the financial
statements are likely to appear and gives advance warning of problems.

Many controllers would say that a daily review of the financial statements is
an excessive use of their time, since a review on each business day of the month
piles up into a formidable block of time. This is true, so the time must be used
wisely. For example, if there are repeated accounting problems with just the rev-
enue-recording part of the financial statements, it may be sufficient to review
only the sales each day. Similarly, if transactions are only posted into the general
ledger once a week, then the financial statements will only be updated once a
week, reducing the number of times when it is necessary to review the state-
ments. Also, if there are lots of minor problems throughout the financial state-
ments, the daily review chore can be assigned to a financial analyst, with instruc-
tions to only notify the controller of major issues. By selecting a review interval
that meets the needs of the specific situation, a controller can reduce the amount
of labor assigned to this task.

TOTAL IMPACT OF BEST PRACTICES ON THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS FUNCTION

This section gives an overview of how and when the best practices described in
this chapter should be implemented, and the total impact of these changes on the
financial statement reporting function.

The “‘how” of implementing best practices in this area is answered by: “Do
them in big blocks.” The reason is that, in general, these best practices are very
easy to implement and can be installed in clusters. Given their minimal impact on
department operations, they rarely have much of an impact on employee morale,
so there is no restriction on multiple implementation projects at the same time. A
key issue to consider is that a number of these implementations do not have a
clear beginning and end. For example, training the staff in closing procedures, or
reviewing wait times, will always require continuing review, because the state of


Summary 251

the art will continually change, making it necessary to go back to these items
constantly. Thus, the best approach is multiple best practice implementations,
which are constantly reviewed.

The other key issue is the timing of the implementations. For most of these
best practices, it is best to conduct an implementation outside of the period when
financial statements are prepared. This point is best illustrated by perusing
Exhibit 12.6. This exhibit clusters all of the best practices into the time before the
end of the reporting period, in the midst of it, or after it. The vast majority of the
practices fall into the first category. This means that most financial statement best
practices can be completed at leisure, when there is not a rush to produce finan-
cial information. The main benefits of this timing issue are that implementations
can be completed more smoothly; there is time to correct mistakes; and if there is
an implementation problem, it can be deferred in favor of the procedure it is
replacing. Therefore, timing of the changes tends to be a minor issue.

The overall impact of best practices on the financial statements function falls
into two areas. One is that financial statements can be completed much more
quickly, efficiently, and with fewer errors, all of which are greatly appreciated by
upper management. The standard for world-class companies with multiple sub-
sidiaries is to issue financial statements in two working days, while single-loca-
tion companies have been known to issue them in as little as one day. These
benchmarks are quite attainable if all of the best practices noted in this chapter
are not only installed, but also constantly reviewed to ensure that they are being
used in the most efficient manner. The other impact of best practices is that the
workload for producing financial statements partially shifts into the week prior to
the end of the reporting period from the week following it. The evidence of this
shift is amply illustrated in Exhibit 12.6, where there are 16 listed activities that
can be completed prior to the end of the reporting period. All accounting man-
agers should integrate this shift in workloads into the schedules of their staffs,
ensuring that there are no excessively high or low work periods resulting from the
change in systems.

SUMMARY

This chapter covered a variety of techniques for improving the speed with which
financial statements can be distributed. These methods vary from shifting the
work of the closing process to before the end of a reporting period to avoiding
some of the closing work entirely. Most of the suggestions noted here will work
in all companies, irrespective of the closing systems they already have in place. A
few items require a careful appraisal of the current situation, however, such as
avoiding the completion of the bank reconciliation and using an automated cutoff
system—these require either special training or new computer systems and must
be used with an eye to the risk of system or training failures and their impact on

the accuracy of the financial statements. No matter which best practices are cho-
sen from the list in this chapter, one overriding issue remains constant—this is a
carefully choreographed dance of many people working together, requiring a

General Best Practices

There are a number of best practices that do not fall into any of the categories
listed in the other chapters of this book. They can be clustered into three primary
areas: activities related to processes, personnel, and reporting, as shown later in
Exhibit 13.9. These are all key areas that deserve special management attention
to ensure that they operate properly. Examples of best practices related to
processes include process centering and consolidating accounting functions,
while examples of best practices for personnel include policies and procedures
manuals and training programs. Finally, examples of best practices related to
reporting include the use of on-line and balanced scorecard reporting. A review
of this array of best practices allows one to enhance a number of key activities.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES FOR GENERAL BEST PRACTICES

This section covers the general level of implementation difficulty that will arise
when installing the best practices discussed later in this chapter. This information
is primarily contained in Exhibit 13.1, which shows the cost and duration of
implementing each best practice.

The best practices noted in this chapter tend to require larger levels of manage-
ment time than those noted in other chapters, as well as a longer project duration
and higher cost. Examples of this are the consolidation of accounting functions and
switching to on-line reporting, which require a great deal of planning and program-
ming work, as well as (in the first case) the geographical transfer of employees.

Even if these difficult best practices are excluded, the remainder will at least
require some advance planning, along with a week or more of work before they
are fully operational. The biggest problem with most is that they are systems —
they require their own procedures, training, and measurements to ensure that they
work properly. Examples of systems best practices are the continual review of
process cycles, training, and process centering. Due to the extra work required to
create and maintain an entire system, one must be aware of the time and effort
needed before some payback will be realized.

Finally, a few best practices are simple to initiate and complete, require min-
imal management attention, and need only a modest amount of follow-up work
from time to time. These best practices include the creation of a contract terms data-
base, issuing activity calendars, and outsourcing tax form preparation. However,

restricting one’s implementation of best practices to just these items would be a
mistake, for the level of accounting efficiency will rise dramatically when the
more difficult implementations are successfully completed.

The remainder of this chapter is grouped into sections, each of which covers
one best practice. In each section, there is a discussion of the problems that a best
practice can alleviate, how the best practice works, and any implementation prob-
lems that may arise.

13-1 COMPARE PERFORMANCE TO PEER METRICS
ON THE INTERNET

The accounting staff may be asked to issue reports to management that compare
the company’s performance to that of other companies. Previously, obtaining this
comparative information can be a painful process of poring through 10-K or 10-
Q reports, extracting information for multiple companies, and summarizing it for
use in internal reports. Now the www.cfo.com Web site has created a simpler
approach to obtaining peer information through its free PeerMetrix service. The
site contains four possible scorecards, which cover comparisons for cash, cost
management, working capital, and tax efficiency. Select one of these options,
pick a time frame for the collected information, and enter one of two options for
defining which companies to use in the sort criteria. These options include up to
five company tickers or a three-digit Media General Financial Services (MGFS)
industry code that will automatically include all public companies in the selected
industry category. The Web site will respond with the following types of informa-
tion:

* Cash metrics. Number of days operating expenses held in cash, cash on
hand, change in cash on hand, change in operating revenue, cash on hand as
a percent of operating revenue, and cash per common share


256 General Best Practices

* Cost management metrics. Cost management index, improvement in the
index, sales, general, and administrative (SG&A) as a percent of revenue,
and cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue

¢ Working capital metrics. Cash conversion efficiency, number of days of
working capital, number of days sales outstanding, inventory turns, and
number of days payables outstanding

° Tax efficiency metrics. Effective tax rate and change in effective tax rate

The information provided can also be sorted into smaller groups by access-
ing a list of all companies that are summarized into the metrics when using the
MGEFS industry code, clicking on only those companies one wants to include in
the metrics and then recompiling the data. The site also lists company revenues,
in case this is needed for selecting only those companies in a certain size range.
This approach is a fast and easy way to obtain key metrics information for com-
pany reports.

13-2 CONSOLIDATE ALL ACCOUNTING FUNCTIONS

A company with many locations will frequently have a separate accounting staff
in each location. By doing so, the overall cost of accounting tends to be much
higher than the industry average because there is a great deal of staff duplication.
For example, each location requires its own controller, assistant controller, and
accounting manager. Also, transaction volumes may not be great enough to fill the
time of the accounting staff in each location, leading to underutilized personnel.
Also, the quality of management may vary significantly between locations, resulting
in differences in the level of efficiency, with locations experiencing the same trans-
action volume requiring significantly different volumes in the number of required
accounting staff. Further, with accounting conducted in many locations, a well-run
company must schedule a large number of internal audits in all of those locations
to ensure that procedures are completed in accordance with corporate standards.
Finally, extra labor is needed at corporate headquarters to consolidate all of the
accounting records for financial reporting purposes. This formidable array of inef-
ficiencies results in a significant increase in accounting expenses.

The best practice that resolves this tangled web of accounting problems is to
consolidate all or most of the functions into the smallest possible number of locations.
By doing so, fewer accounting managers are needed, while procedures can be stan-
dardized and enforced much more easily. Also, given the smaller number of locations,
the work of consolidating financial results is much easier. The only case in which
this solution does not work well is if a company has an extremely diversified set of
subsidiaries. For example, the accounting operations of a railroad, an oil refinery,
and a cement plant are so different that consolidating these functions would be


13-3 Continually Review Key Process Cycles 257

extremely difficult. Conversely, the consolidation task becomes much easier for
those companies that do business in a single industry and have many locations that
conduct the same kind of business using approximately the same procedures.

Here are the most common areas in which companies have had success in
centralizing into shared services centers:

¢ Accounts receivable collections

* Cash application

* Cost accounting

¢ Employee expense report processing

¢ Intercompany accounts payable and receivable processing
¢ Inventory accounting

¢ Invoice processing

¢ Payroll processing

The difficulty with this best practice is that it requires a great deal of manage-
ment skill and money to consolidate accounting operations. For example, combining
the accounts payable functions of many locations requires the construction of a
central processing facility, along with the transfer of staff to that location, retraining,
the design of new systems, new audit procedures, and the orderly transfer of sup-
plier invoices from many locations to a single one —and in the midst of this massive
change, suppliers must still be paid on time so there is no disruption of deliveries to
the company from suppliers. Given the size of this task, the major factors needed to
ensure success are the appointment of an excellent manager to the consolidation
process, the complete support of this project by top management, and sufficient
funding to see it through to completion. In addition, given the amount of disruption
involved, it would be wise to consolidate only one function at a time so that most
activities are not interrupted at the same time. By taking these steps, the odds of
successfully finishing a consolidation project are greatly enhanced.

13-3 CONTINUALLY REVIEW KEY PROCESS CYCLES

As a general rule, any system will begin to degrade as soon as it is created. For
example, a new purchasing process cycle will begin almost immediately to
encounter exceptions to the rules, as well as special situations that spawn a subset
of extra procedures that do not appear anywhere in the procedures manual. Fur-
ther, the process will not be maintained very well, resulting in lots of excess data
in the system, such as the records of suppliers that have not been used in years,
perpetually open purchase orders, even though the orders were filled long ago,


258 General Best Practices

and supplier invoices that have a permanent “‘hold” slapped on them so that they
cannot be paid. The example is only for accounts payable, but the same problem
applies to all processes. Thus, over time, all of an accounting department’s
processes will be in desperate need of a tune-up.

That tune-up is provided by a rarely used best practice in which a designated
employee is in charge of constantly reviewing process cycles. In some compa-
nies, this person is called the “process owner,” with responsibility for the flow of
information through a specific process and for any changes to it. When someone
is assigned to review process cycles, there should be a very detailed set of tasks to
be reviewed. To use the previous example, the process owner should review the
list of suppliers in the computer to see which can be deleted, check on open pur-
chase orders to see what can be closed, review the list of suppliers with early pay-
ment discounts to verify that discounts are taken, check with the receiving staff to
make sure that they receive only goods labeled with valid purchase order num-
bers, and review payment packets to verify that all payments were only for items
authorized by the purchasing department. If the process is complex enough, one
or more people may be assigned to it—otherwise, one person may be assigned
multiple cycles and rotate through a review of them all so all primary cycles
receive a tune-up several times a year.

One advantage of constantly reviewing process cycles is that few exception
transactions will occur, resulting in far less research work to correct problems.
Another factor is that employees who are involved in creating transactions will
receive constant advice from the process owner regarding how they are supposed
to be conducting their work, resulting in much better standardization of output.
Further, the process owner constantly reviews why old transactions have not yet
been completed, tracks down the reasons for the problems, and corrects them at
the source. None of these changes are major, but when taken as a whole, they rep-
resent a considerable improvement in the way a company’s key processes operate.
This work is well worth the effort.

The main disadvantage of this best practice is that the process owner is a new
position and adds to overhead. However, the number of mistakes this person finds
and corrects will frequently pay back his or her salary. For example, finding and fix-
ing a hole in the revenue cycle that lets shipments disappear from the system may
keep a company from missing billings to customers. Similarly, keeping the accounts
payable staff from making unapproved payments to suppliers will also save money.
Another problem is that this position tends to step outside the boundaries of the
accounting department since the processes being reviewed are impacted by other
departments, such as the shipping and receiving departments and the purchasing
department. Because this may be looked on as interference by the accounting
department, a process owner must be a very tactful person and strongly supported by
upper management. If these issues can be overcome, the process owner becomes a
major contributor to the smooth functioning of any company.

13-4 CREATE A POLICY AND
PROCEDURE MANUAL WV Author’s Choice

As is noted several times in this chapter, an unorganized accounting department
is inefficient, suffers from a high transaction error rate, and does not complete its
work products on time. While other best practices noted in this chapter, such as
general training, cross-training, and calendars of events, will contribute to a more
structured environment, one of the very best ways to create a disciplined account-
ing group is to create and maintain a policies and procedures manual.

This manual should list the main policies under which the accounting depart-
ment operates, such as those listed in Exhibit 13.2. These are the key issues that
confront each functional area and are usually limited to just a few pages. Any-
thing longer probably indicates an excessive degree of control or some confusion
in the difference between a policy and a procedure.

A good example of a policy is one that sets a boundary for an activity. The
first policy noted in Exhibit 13.2 states that an accounts payable clerk is allowed
to process any supplier invoice within 5 percent of the amount listed on the origi-
nal purchase order. By doing so, this policy clearly defines what the clerk is
allowed to do. A procedure, on the other hand, defines the precise activities that
take place within the boundaries the policies create. An example of a procedure is
shown in Exhibit 13.3, where there is a definitive listing of the exact steps one
must follow in order to create and issue the annual budget. A procedure is usually
sufficient to use as a guideline for an employee who needs to understand how a
process works. When combined with a proper level of training, the policies and
procedures manual is an effective way not only to increase control over the
accounting department, but also to enhance its efficiency.

Though there are few excuses for not having such a manual, there are some
pitfalls to consider when constructing it, as well as for maintaining and enforcing
it. They are as follows:

¢ Not enough detail. A procedure that does not cover activity steps in a suffi-
cient degree of detail is not of much use to someone who is using it for the
first time; it is important to list specific forms used, computer screens
accessed, and fields on those screens in which information is entered, as well
as the other positions that either supply information for the procedure or to
which it sends information. It may also be helpful to include a flowchart,
which is more understandable than text for some people.

¢ Not reinforced. A procedures manual does not do much good if it is imme-
diately parked on a remote shelf in the accounting department. Instead, it
should be made an integral part of all training programs and included in
periodic discussions regarding the updating and improvement of key
processes. Only through constant attention will the manual be used to the
fullest extent.

¢ There is no reimbursement for lunch mileage.

 

¢ Not updated. Even the best manual will become obsolete over time, as
changing circumstances alter procedures to the point where the manual no
longer describes conditions as they currently exist. When this happens, no
one bothers to use the manual. Accordingly, it is necessary to update the
manual whenever changes are made to the underlying systems.

¢ Too many procedures. A common problem is that the manual is never released
because the controller is determined to include a procedure for every conceiv-
able activity the accounting department will ever encounter. However, the
main principle to follow is that the manual must be issued soon, so it is better to
issue it quickly with procedures that cover the bulk of accounting activities and
address the remaining procedures at a later date. This approach gets the key
information to those employees who need it the most, and does so very quickly.

The single most important factor in the success of a policies and procedures
manual is an active accounting manager. This person must reinforce the use of the
manual with the staff so it is not simply ignored as a one-time report gathering
dust on a shelf. Only through continual attention by the entire staff will it become
the foundation of how all key accounting processes are completed.

262 General Best Practices

Exhibit 13.3. Sample Procedure Page

Procedure: Update the annual budget
Responsibility: Controller
Steps:

1. Expense update. As of mid-November, issue each department a listing of its
expenses, annualized based on actual expenses through October of the cur-
rent year. The listing should include the personnel in each department and
their current pay levels. Request a return date of 10 days in the future for this
information, which should include estimated changes in expenses.

2. Revenue update. As of mid-November, issue the sales manager a listing of
revenue by month by business unit, through October of the current year.
Request a return date of 10 days in the future for this information, which
should include estimated changes in revenues.

3. Capital expenditure update. As of mid-November, issue a form to all depart-
ment heads, requesting information about the cost and timing of capital
expenditures for the upcoming year. Request a return date of 10 days in the
future for this information.

4. Automation update. As of mid-November, issue a form to the engineering man-
ager, requesting estimates of the timing and size of reductions in headcount in
the upcoming year due to automation efforts. Request a return date of 10 days
in the future for this information. Be sure to compare scheduled headcount
reductions to the timing of capital expenditures, since they should track closely.

5. Update the budget model. This task should be completed by the end of
November, and includes the following steps:

1. Update the numbers already listed in the budget with information
received from the various managers. This may involve changing “‘hard-
coded” dollar amounts or changing flex budget percentages. Be sure to
keep a checklist of who has returned information so you can follow up
with those personnel who have not returned it.

2. Update the “Prior Year” cells on the left side of the budget model with
estimated year-end balances (primarily for the balance sheet).

3. Update the “Last Year” cells on the right side of the budget model, using
annualized figures.

4. Verify that the indirect overhead allocation percentages shown on the
budgeted factory overhead page are still accurate.

5. Verify that the Federal Insurance Contributors Act (FICA), State Unem-
ployment Tax (SUTA), Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA), medical,
and workers’ compensation amounts listed at the top of the staffing bud-
get page are still accurate.


13-5 Eliminate All Transaction Backlogs 263

Exhibit 13.3 (Continued)

6. Add job titles and pay levels to the staffing page as needed, along with
new average pay rates based on projected pay levels made by department
managers.

7. Run a depreciation report for the upcoming year, add the expected depre-
ciation for new capital expenditures, and add this amount to the budget.

8. Revise the loan detail budget based on projected borrowings through the
end of the year. Be sure to list only loan balance reductions based on prin-
cipal pay-downs, not interest payments.

6. Review the budget. Print out the budget and circle any budgeted expenses or
revenues that are significantly different from the annualized amounts for the
current year (do this by comparing the last two columns on each page). Go
over the questionable items with the managers who are responsible for them.

7. Revise the budget. Revise the budget, print it again, and review it with the
president. Incorporate any additional changes.

8. Issue the budget. Bind the budget and issue it to the management team.

9. Update accounting database. Enter budget numbers into the accounting

software for the upcoming year. All tasks should be completed by mid-
December.

 

13-5 ELIMINATE ALL TRANSACTION BACKLOGS = WAuthor’s Choice

Accounting departments get in trouble when they develop a permanent backlog
of standard accounting transactions, usually in the areas of cash receipts process-
ing, billings, and payables. When a backlog arises, the focus of the department
shifts to the servicing of this backlog, to the exclusion of all other value-added
activities, such as improving processes or providing better customer service.
Also, backlogs tend to create piles of paperwork in which other documents can
be lost, resulting in extra search time to locate needed materials.

A crucial best practice is to eliminate these backlogs, usually by allocating
extra staff time to them. Once the piles are eliminated, the controller can focus on
increased levels of training and process improvement in order to reduce the num-
ber of people required to keep the backlog from reoccurring. If a company has a
highly variable amount of transaction volume, some backlog may reappear in
periods of high activity, though this can be avoided through the careful use of the
preplanned hiring of part-time workers to assist the regular staff. There is also
likely to be some buildup in the backlog on a temporary basis at the end of each
month and especially at the end of the fiscal year, as closing activities take priority.

However, these are temporary issues whose impact on the backlog can be elimi-
nated within a few days.

13-6 IMPLEMENT PROCESS-CENTERING

A major problem at many companies is the inordinate amount of time it takes to
complete a process. For example, insurance companies are famous for spending
many weeks to review an insurance claim and issue a payment check, when the
total amount of work required is under an hour. The long time period from the
beginning to the end of the process is usually due to the number of transfers
between employees. For example, the insurance branch office may forward a claim
to an insurance adjuster, who passes it along to a manager if the amount exceeds a
set level, or who hands it off to another person who checks to see if the claim may
be fraudulent or if the claimant has an unusually long history of claims, then moves
the paperwork to another person who issues checks, and then returns the entire
packet to the insurance branch office. Insurance is just an example—upon further
investigation, it is common to find that all companies invest a shocking amount of
time in moving paperwork between a multitude of employees. A related problem is
that transactions can be lost when they are moved between employees. Further, it is
difficult to pin blame on anyone when a transaction is improperly completed
because there are so many people involved in the process. Thus, spreading work
among too many people opens a virtual Pandora’s box of troubles.

The best practice that resolves this problem is called process-centering. Its
underlying principle is to cluster as many work tasks for a single process as pos-
sible with a single person. By doing so, there are fewer transfers of documenta-
tion, which reduces the amount of time lost during these movements, while at the
same time eliminating the risk that paperwork will be lost. Further, employees
have much more complete and fulfilling jobs since they see a much larger part of
the process and have a better feeling for how the entire process works. And best
of all for a company, the time needed to complete transactions drops drastically,
sometimes to less than 10 percent of the amount previously needed.

The main problem with process-centering is employee resistance. This is a
reengineering best practice, which means that the old process is ripped up and
replaced with an entirely new workflow, which makes many employees nervous
about their jobs, or if they will even have a job when the changes are complete.
Accordingly, they usually are not pleased with the prospect of a new system and
resist vigorously, or at least are of any assistance. Only excellent communications
and a strong commitment by top management to completing the project will
make this best practice operational, given the likely level of resistance to it.

13-7 ISSUE ACTIVITY CALENDARS TO ALL
ACCOUNTING POSITIONS WV Author’s Choice

The bane of any accounting department is disorganization. This department,
above all others, is responsible for consistently completing the same tasks, day
after day and year after year, with a great deal of reliability. If the employees can-
not organize themselves properly so key tasks are completed on time, the entire
function can fall into disarray, resulting in payments and billings not being com-
pleted on time. Also, financial statements, the most subject to delays if there is
disorganization, will be released much later than expected, possibly containing a
large number of errors. Clearly, some instrument of organization must be found.

An excellent tool for straightening out the timing of accounting work is the cal-
endar. One can create a calendar on the computer, either with a scheduling software
package or an electronic spreadsheet, and load it with all of the tasks that must be
completed each day. An example of such a calendar is shown in Exhibit 13.4.
Though some employees are naturally well-organized and will already have it in
place, many others will be in desperate need of this simple organizational tool. The
best way to distribute these calendar schedules is to keep the schedules for all
employees in a single location, update them at the end of each month, and have a
staff meeting to distribute them so the controller can emphasize all calendar changes.
It is then a simple matter to refer to copies of all employees’ calendars each day and
follow up with them to ensure that they are completing the scheduled tasks.

The calendar is only one way to assist in managing the operations of the
accounting department. Another excellent tool is the policy and procedure man-
ual, which was discussed earlier in this chapter, in the “Create a Policy and Pro-
cedure Manual” section.

13-8 POST THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MANUAL
ON THE COMPANY INTRANET SITE

When the accounting staff is widely scattered through many locations, it is diffi-
cult to make available to them a current version of the accounting policies and
procedures manual. This can be a real problem, for the accounting department is
much more procedurally driven than any other department, and operating with
antiquated procedures can cause significant differences in operations between
various locations. Traditionally, this problem has been addressed by creating an
internal procedure-writing and publishing department that constantly updates
documents, maintains a list of authorized recipients, and mails the changed docu-
ments to them. This group is expensive, and does not always result in updated
manuals at outlying locations, especially if those outlying personnel take a dim
view of spending their valuable time replacing pages in their procedures manuals.

A significant improvement on this method is to convert each page of the man-
ual into an HTML or Adobe Acrobat format, so that it can be posted directly to the

corporate intranet site. By doing so, there is no need to publish and distribute any
more paper-based documents. In addition, an on-line index can allow users to
quickly search through the database to find the exact procedural references they
need. In addition, there is no longer a need to gradually compile a lengthy list of
procedure changes and then issue all of the changes at the same time; instead, a
procedure writer can quickly make any change and immediately post it to the
intranet site. The only problem with this approach is that all accounting personnel
must have ready access to the site where the documents are posted. This requires a
reasonably advanced level of networking ability within a company.

13-9 SELL THE SHARED SERVICES CENTER

Larger corporations have been working for the last decade to centralize their far-
flung transaction processing operations, on the grounds that increasing the trans-


13-10 Switch to an Application Service Provider 267

action volume in a single location will reduce the cost per transaction processed.
This theory has proven to be true, resulting in the centralization of such functions
as accounts receivable, accounts payable, payroll, and cash application. It is even
listed earlier in this chapter as a recommended best practice.

As a result of this intense focus on efficiency, many organizations have
achieved remarkably low costs per transaction. However, one must ask if the
focus of company management should be centered on activities that are generic
transactions or on value-added activities —in short, has the drive toward excellent
operations been in the wrong area of the company? If the answer to this question
is “yes,” then perhaps the next step is to sell the shared services center.

By selling the center to a supplier that specializes in outsourced services, a
company can realize a cash gain from the sale for a one-time jump in profits and
cash flow, while also writing into the sale agreement a clause that requires the
buyer to continue to use the center to provide services to the company for a des-
ignated period of time and at prespecified rates. This approach eliminates the
management time invested in the process, continues to result in low transaction
costs, and yields a cash payment. Why would a supplier agree to such a deal?
Because it gains a large block of business from the seller for a period of years,
while also gaining the expertise of the employees running the center. The supplier
can then sell the services of this group to other customers, thereby expanding the
scope of the shared services business. Consequently, this best practice is one that
enhances the position of all involved parties.

13-10 SWITCH TO AN APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDER

The typical accountant has a great deal of training and experience in how to
process accounting transactions, but much less in how to select, install, and main-
tain an accounting software package. Despite this shortcoming, often an accoun-
tant will be called on at some time to either fix or maintain an existing accounting
software package or select and install a new one. The most common issue of all is
the continuing addition of software upgrades, and dealing with the technical
issues caused by them. Not far behind is dealing with the problems that arise
when a software system crashes. Given the lack of expertise in this area, it is no
surprise that many accountants do not show a high degree of competence when
this happens, which can have a significant impact on their careers.

Luckily, it is now possible to leave the software problem to someone else
through the use of an application service provider (ASP). This is a company that
maintains accounting (or other) software on its own computer system, and is
responsible for its upkeep and reliability. Users of the ASP’s services simply log
in to process their transactions, and depart when they are done—leaving all sys-
tem maintenance worries to the ASP’s staff.


268 General Best Practices

This is a particularly fine option for smaller companies that cannot afford the
cost of purchasing and implementing their own accounting software and hard-
ware, which can run over $100,000 for even a modest installation. It is also a
good alternative for any company that needs to switch to a new system in a hurry,
since the existence of a functioning software system eliminates the many imple-
mentation steps associated with system installation and testing. Further, any orga-
nization that wants to focus its attention on its key strategic values will like this
option, since it can use it to avoid investing valuable management time in the
oversight of the information systems department.

A good example of the uses to which ASP software can be put is the order
entry function. Traditionally, the sales staff mails, calls, or faxes orders to the
accounting staff, which then enters this information into the accounting system.
This approach results in lost or miskeyed orders, and therefore unhappy cus-
tomers. However, with an ASP, the sales staff can directly access the order entry
system over the Internet and enter their orders directly into it, without worrying
about any of the just-noted problems.

There are a few problems with ASPs. One is that they do not want to cus-
tomize their software for any but the largest customers, since their business model
depends on selling the same type of software product to as many companies as
possible. This is a particular problem for those companies that have so extensively
modified their computer systems for competitive purposes that a change to a more
“vanilla” package may seriously jeopardize their profitability. Another issue is that
most ASPs do not offer a complete solution that covers the functions of all key
areas of a company (as is now the case with enterprise resource planning systems
that are installed in-house). At the moment, the most comprehensive software
offerings are by Usinternetworking, which has available software for accounting,
finance, human resources, sales force automation, and human resources.

Another issue is the security of the company data that is stored at the ASP
location. There may be many companies using the software, and there should be
no way that anyone from one company can accidentally access the data owned by
someone else; these issues should be addressed by a set of security provisions
and guarantees that are outlined in a service level agreement (SLA). A final con-
cern is that any stoppage in the Internet connection to an ASP will bring down a
company’s computer access to its ASP-based software; this will become less of a
problem as Internet connections become more reliable.

More than 300 companies offer ASP services. Examples of this group are Oracle
Business Online, Asera, NetLedger, Usinternetworking, Corio, and mySAP.com.
When deciding on which one to select, a key factor is the range of different soft-
ware systems offered by each one. If a supplier only maintains software that has
limited applicability in a company’s field of operations, then a different supplier
may be the answer.

13-11 Switch to On-line Reporting 269

13-11 SWITCH TO ON-LINE REPORTING

In organizations that occupy a large geographical area, the accounting staff faces
the chore of somehow sending financial and operational reporting information to
many locations. This can mean a mass mailing once a month, or perhaps more
frequently if daily or weekly reports are required. If there is some urgency to this
information, overnight express mail delivery may be necessary, which is quite
expensive, especially when used many times a year for many locations. Faxing
this information is frequently not an allowable option, for the information being
transmitted may be so sensitive that there is too great a risk that the wrong person
will retrieve the information from the fax machine. Thus, sending paper reports
throughout a company, and especially a large one, is a major hassle.

An effective means for eliminating the problems with paper-based reports is
to switch to electronic transmission. By doing so, there is no need to send any
paper documents and there is also no transmission time interval before the infor-
mation is available to recipients. The only difficulty with this approach is that a
few of the more formal documents, such as audited financial statements, with
their accompanying footnotes and graphics, cannot be sent easily by electronic
means. However, for the bulk of all reports, this remains an effective approach.

Information can be sent electronically in either a passive or “push” mode. In
the passive mode, the accounting department simply posts the information in a
file and waits for employees to go to the file to scan the data. The ‘‘push” method
involves sending information to employees by e-mail. The “‘push” method is gen-
erally more effective, since there is no way for employees to avoid the data,
unless they are in the habit of deleting their e-mail without first reading it.

This approach can be an expensive one with a long implementation interval,
but only under certain implementation approaches. It is certainly more expen-
sive if a special file structure is created to contain the on-line reports, especially
if the data is to be contained in a data warehouse (a major undertaking that is not
recommended). Even the less difficult approach of sending out reports by e-mail
requires the previous installation of a companywide e-mail system, which can be
a problem if there are many locations that must be linked. However, the distribu-
tion of data is made vastly easier by the presence of the Internet; any company
location can now obtain an e-mail address from a third-party e-mail provider at
minimal cost and receive electronic transmissions through this electronic mail-
box. Another alternative is to spend a moderate amount on a corporate intranet
site, on which financial reports can be posted under an icon. Though an effective
and easy-to-use approach, it does require access to the intranet from outlying
locations. Consequently, there are a range of implementation alternatives for all
possible budgets, starting with distribution by the Internet, progressing through
an intranet site, and ending with a custom-made file structure with comprehensive

user access. The best approach will depend on a company’s budget, existing sys-
tems, and information distribution requirements.

13-12 TRACK FUNCTION MEASUREMENTS WV Author’s Choice

The role of the accounting department does not just include completing daily
transactions and issuing financial statements. In addition, it must issue periodic
measurements to the rest of the company that show the results of key activities. A
poorly organized accounting department may issue this information only grudg-
ingly when senior management demands it and then stop immediately once the
complaints cease. This approach does not allow the accounting staff to derive a
set of standard procedures for the collection of measurement information, nor
does it build up much goodwill with the management team.

A better approach is to create a standardized set of performance criteria that the
accounting staff will calculate and distribute at set intervals. An example of such a
report is shown in Exhibit 13.5. By using this report, management can spot opera-
tional problems at once and correct them. Also, the controller can play a key role in
determining which measurements are used; this can be a pivotal item in some situa-
tions, for other department managers may not want to have their poor performance
measured and reported. Also, with a standardized set of measurements, the controller
can build the measurement task into the accounting department’s daily work sched-
ule in a manner that does not interfere with other operations, while also allowing for
the construction of a procedure that standardizes the calculation of each measure-
ment (ensuring the consistency of calculations from period to period). These are all
good reasons for implementing a reporting system for key corporate measurements.

13-13 USE BALANCED SCORECARD REPORTING

The typical controller only reports on the financial situation of a company. Unfor-
tunately, this is the information that is the result of many other activities that the
accounting department does not normally have anything to do with. For example,
profits are impacted if the customer is not satisfied (impacted by quality, pricing,
and on-time delivery), if internal business processes do not function properly (which
are impacted by such issues as machine utilization and the level of automation),
and if employees are not well trained in their jobs (which is impacted by training
and any factors leading to high employee turnover). A controller is not accustomed
to reporting on any of these issues, but they all impact company profitability, the
controller’s primary reporting responsibility.

272 General Best Practices

Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton have addressed this issue in their
landmark book, The Balanced Scorecard (Harvard Business School Press, 1996).
In it, they argue a strong case in favor of an entirely new method of reporting that
itemizes the key factors that impact company profitability. An example of such a
report is shown in Exhibit 13.6, where measurements are clustered into blocks,
each one concerned with a different aspect of key success factors: financial, cus-
tomer, internal business processes, and employee learning and growth. Kaplan
and Norton feel that these four areas must be closely managed as a whole in order
to attain truly exceptional levels of profitability.

Where does this leave a controller? This person is the one whom most of a
company relies on to issue reports regularly on company status, even though
those reports are only concerned with finances. Since reporting is already a part
of this person’s job, it only makes sense to expand the range of information cov-
ered to include those Kaplan and Norton advocate. This will require new report-
ing systems, as well as direction from senior management, since the exact mea-
surements selected will require some thought by that group. In addition, the
company will certainly want to see the traditional set of financial information as
well, so this will be an added task for the controller—but one that management
can use to track the performance of many more key functions than were previ-
ously covered by any sort of accounting reports.

13-14 CREATE A CONTRACT TERMS
DATABASE WV Author’s Choice

It is a common occurrence for the accounting department to forget about the
terms of various agreements other departments of a company entered into, result-
ing in missed billings to customers or payments to suppliers. Due to the special
nature of these agreements, which usually fall outside of the usual accounts
payable and receivable systems, it is easy for them to be forgotten. Examples of
these contracts are billings for the sublease of company equipment, rebates, and
maintenance agreements. The typical result of these problems is either missing
revenue, because customers were not billed, or irate suppliers that were not paid.
In the latter case, missing payments to suppliers may also result in the failure of
key services to the company, such as failed maintenance agreements for key
equipment. Thus, a lack of attention to the terms of a company’s various contrac-
tual arrangements can result in lost revenues or services.

The solution to this problem is to create a database of all current contractual
agreements, along with a central file containing copies of all the contracts. An
example of a contract terms database is shown in Exhibit 13.7. This database lists
all of the key information about each contract, including the due date on which
billings or payments are supposed to occur, the termination date of the contract, the

details to clarify the nature of each transaction—in short, a brief but thorough sum-

there are questions about the terms of each agreement, the accounting department
should maintain copies of all agreements, as well as an extra file containing any
agreements that have expired in the last few years. This arrangement will quickly
bring order to the administration of any contracts that are the responsibility of the
accounting department.

The implication thus far has been to create a contract terms database from
scratch. However, it is also possible to purchase a commercial off-the-shelf product
from a number of suppliers, such as J.D. Edwards, Oracle, diCarta, PeopleSoft,
Webango, and Siebel Systems. These systems are usually linked to a company’s
enterprise resource planning (ERP) or customer relationship management (CRM)
software, so they can access information stored elsewhere in the company. This
linkage requires a custom-built interface. Depending on the amount of contrac-
tual information to be included in the installed system, one can expect the imple-
mentation of such a system to extend from at least two months up to a year. The
cost of these systems begins at about $150,000 for a small installation and can
easily reach several million dollars for a large company, depending on the number
of users. Some special features make this software worth the price; for example,
the ability to pinpoint contract wording that may impact revenue recognition,
such as acceptance clauses and extended payment terms. This is particularly
valuable in avoiding embarrassing adjustments to the level of revenue recognized
in order to be in compliance with GAAP and SEC rules.

Another feature is a warning indicator when one customer is being offered a
lower price than other customers, which flags other contractual agreements in
which other customers are guaranteed the lowest price offered. By spotting this
problem in advance, a company can avoid having to rebate payments to other
customers in order to bring the prices they paid down to the price level of the
most recent customer contract.

Most of these software packages also offer a library of standard contract
terms, so that a company can extract the boilerplate text it needs to construct new
contracts much more quickly. By doing so, one can also ensure that the same text
is used across all contracts, thereby ensuring a fair degree of uniformity.

276 General Best Practices

13-15 SCAN DATA WITH MODIFIED PALM
COMPUTING PLATFORM

There are a number of applications in which accounting department personnel
can scan bar codes that store data about various items, such as personnel, fixed
assets, or inventory, and then either compare this information to a central data-
base for accuracy or input new data to a database that is at least partially com-
prised of this bar coded data. For example, the accounting staff should verify the
existence of all fixed assets in the company at least once a year. To do so, they can
scan the bar coded identification tags that are attached to each asset. This task is
typically accomplished with a bar code scanner that either transmits the data
directly to the central accounting computer or stores it internally for an upload at
a later date. These scanners can be quite expensive. An alternative to this
approach has just been developed by Symbol Technologies.

Symbol has developed a variation on the popular Palm computing platform
that contains a bar code scanner that can scan and translate nearly all of the
major bar code methodologies. The product descriptions can be found on the
Internet at www.symbol.com/palm. With this product, one can scan and store bar
codes in the Palm computer and then upload this data at the user’s leisure into
the central accounting database. It is also possible to first download data to the
Palm and then use the scanning option to bring in and compare additional data
to the downloaded data. For example, inventory information can be dumped
into the Palm, so that the user can take it to the warehouse and scan in product
quantities during an inventory count. A program stored in the Palm can then
compare the quantities scanned to the inventory information. Any differences
can be investigated on the spot.

The initial pricing for these Palm products are in the range of $500 to $700,
depending on the amount of RAM added to them. These prices are roughly dou-
ble the rate at which a Palm computer without the scanning feature can be pur-
chased. The software for these products is still being developed, so it may be eas-
ier to purchase developer software from the manufacturer in order to create
internal applications. At this time, the main development effort has been made by
Stevens Creek Software, which has developed the On Hand program that allows
one to conduct inventory counts and asset tracking. A similar product, called
Pocket Inventory, has been developed by PC America.

A unique possibility is the ability to create invoices in the field with the Sym-
bol Palm computer. By using either the Route Accounting Automation software,
written by Remote Data Systems, or else the Route Salesman 3 software, written by
PalmX Route Accounting, one can scan shipping information in the field, such as
product codes, prices, and quantities, and create an invoice on the spot for immedi-
ate delivery to the customer. This option requires the use of portable printer that can
receive information from the infrared port on the Palm computer.

This new device may become a superior tool that supplants the more tradi-
tional bar code scanning devices that have been available for many years, because


13-17 Create an On-line Tax Policy Listing 277

it also includes a miniature computer that results in more computing capability.
However, the software needed to link it to one’s accounting systems is still in its
infancy, and will therefore probably require some degree of customization, if not
a complete software writing project, before it can be tightly integrated. Conse-
quently, the effort required to make the Symbol Palm computer a major new
accounting tool may be considerable.

13-16 SCAN FINGERPRINTS AT USER WORKSTATIONS

Security is always an issue in the accounting department, where the staff is con-
stantly reviewing confidential materials. It is a real problem trying to keep unau-
thorized personnel from accessing accounting terminals, unless the entire depart-
ment is to be locked up behind a fence.

A unique new approach to solving the security problem is to use a variety of
input devices that scan one’s thumbprint or fingerprint and transmits the scan to a
central file for verification. If the scanned image matches that of an on-file
thumbprint, then the user is allowed access to the terminal.

A scanner mouse, called the EyeD Mouse™, is available from Secugen
Corporation (www.secugen.com). The same company also sells a keyboard,
called the EyeD KeyBoard™ , that contains a scanner for fingerprints. Yet another
option that it sells is the EyeD Hamster™ , which is a separate scanning device
that is used by those who do not wish to replace their existing mice or keyboards.

There are a few downsides to the use of this technology. The main one is that
some software reconfiguration will be necessary to ensure that selected databases
are covered by this security feature. A lesser issue is the cost of the new scanning
equipment; prices are roughly double the amount that one would spend on mice
or keyboards that do not contain these biometric security features.

13-17 CREATE AN ON-LINE TAX POLICY LISTING

The accounting staff does not always have a clear grasp of the tax implications of
various accounting transactions. Examples of these problem areas are transfer
pricing, capital movements, and employee contracts and benefits. When a ques-
tion arises in regard to such a problem, either it is put on hold while a question is
run past the legal or tax staffs, or else it is processed in ignorance of the answer—
which frequently leads to a lack of consistency in the handling of transactions,
and a large headache for the tax staff. These problems can be avoided by
installing a clear set of tax policies on-line.


278 General Best Practices

By itemizing the most current tax policies on-line, anyone in the accounting
department can readily research problems and expect to find answers within a
few minutes of a tax-related question being posed. If the answer is not there, then
the site can also include an e-mail linkage to the tax or legal department, so that
the problem can then be properly researched and posted on-line for the next per-
son who has the same problem. Also, because the posting is on-line, there is no
need to issue a cumbersome mailing to a list of approved recipients every time a
change is made to the policies; instead, the change can be readily made to the on-
line posting, which makes it available to anyone at once. There will be complex
transactional situations that are so unique that only the advice of a trained tax
person will yield the correct answer to a query. Nonetheless, the majority of tax
problems can be resolved for the accounting staff by this simple means.

13-18 OUTSOURCE TAX FORM PREPARATION

For smaller firms, the accurate and timely preparation of tax forms is a monumental
pain that frequently results in missed filing dates, incorrect payments, and penalties.
The reason is that a smaller organization cannot afford the services of a full-time tax
accountant, which means that incoming tax forms are routed to whomever has time
to complete them. No one likes to do tax forms and so they end up at the bottom of
someone’s work pile, which results in a last-minute rush to complete them, without
much regard to accuracy or filing dates. Larger organizations do not have this prob-
lem, since they have specialists on staff who can organize a steady stream of tax
work, resulting in accurate tax filings mailed out precisely on time and that are sup-
ported by fully documented work papers that can be easily audited. Thus, the con-
troller of a small company needs to find a better way to prepare tax forms.

The solution is to outsource the bulk of the tax filings to one or more suppli-
ers, usually with a few tax returns remaining in-house. A common situation is for
a company’s audit firm to take over all federal and state income tax returns. These
are among the most complex returns to file, and these are precisely the forms that
most audit firms specialize in filing. In addition, many companies outsource their
payroll so the payroll-processing suppliers will handle all of the tax return infor-
mation related to payroll. This leaves local returns, which are best kept in-
house—the reason is that these documents are usually so specialized that suppliers
do not have any experience in filing them and so are no more efficient (and much
more expensive) than the accounting employees who can do the same work.
Thus, there are opportunities to divest an accounting department of the majority
of its tax form preparation work.

There are two factors to consider when outsourcing tax work. One is that some
suppliers will charge an inordinate amount to prepare a tax return. To avoid this
problem, it is wise to first inquire about the hourly rates of the supplier’s staff who


13-19 Pay Federal Taxes On-line 279

are most likely to prepare taxes and the likely time required to complete each
return. If the expected amount is too high, it may be useful to comparison-shop
against the rates of other tax preparation firms. It may also be possible to institute a
fixed fee for each tax return, thereby capping the expense. The other problem is that
there is some inefficiency in separating the tax filing work from the outside auditors
a company already uses. The reason is that the auditor must copy the work papers
and send them to the tax supplier, which is not only an extra expense, but also
slower than leaving all of the work with the auditor. Despite these problems, it is a
very good idea for a smaller firm to outsource the preparation of its tax returns.

13-19 PAY FEDERAL TAXES ON-LINE

There are a number of taxes that a company must pay to the federal government,
such as unemployment insurance, Medicare, Social Security, withheld income
taxes, and corporate income taxes. Since this can involve a substantial amount of
money, companies tend to wait until the last minute to deposit them, usually
through the local bank. If there is no one available to go to the bank to transfer
the funds to the government, or if the bank is closed for any reason, then the com-
pany will be penalized for late payments. This is a particular problem when only
a few people know how to make the deposits and they are unavailable for any rea-
son on the day when a payment is required.

These problems can be resolved by making on-line payments to the federal
government through its free www.eftps. gov site. This involves creating an account
with the government on-line through its “New Taxpayer Enrollment Form” and
then waiting up to 15 days for the IRS to mail a PIN number to you. Once
received, a company can then request an Internet password and submit tax pay-
ments at any time of the day or night, seven days a week. The government then
transfers the designated funds out of the company bank account. A printable con-
firmation is made available, which a company can retain as proof of payment to
the government. A transaction history is also available on-line for all payments
made within the last 120 days. It is even possible to schedule payments up to 120
days prior to a tax payment due date, so that the government can automatically
withdraw the required funds on a targeted date without anyone from the company
having to be present. Though the implication here is that payments are only
authorized through an Internet site, a company can also do this over the phone or
with downloaded PC-based software that uses a dial-up modem.

Once a company’s total tax remittances to the federal government exceed
$200,000 per year, it must use this system. If a company that is required to use the
system then chooses to make a manual payment with a tax coupon, it will be sub-
ject to a 10 percent penalty (though this does not apply to voluntary participants
that fall below the $200,000 threshold). Also, if a company pays taxes from a


280 General Best Practices

variety of bank accounts, it must set up different accounts with the government
for each bank account, since there is currently no way for the government to
remove funds from multiple accounts through the electronic funds payment
transfer system (EFTPS) system. Finally, the system cannot be used to make last-
minute payments; instead, transfers must be initiated no later than the day before
a tax payment is due, in order to ensure that the IRS receives it in time.

13-20 REDUCE TAX PENALTIES WITH INTERNET-BASED
PENALTY MODELING

When a company misses making a tax deposit to the IRS, the IRS always applies
the next deposit received to the missing deposit, even though the next deposit
received may apply to a different payment period. This creates a cascading series
of penalties, because the first penalty will still be recorded in the IRS database as
having been received late, as well as the second deposit (since it was applied to
the first deposit), and so on. The result can be quite hefty penalty and interest
payments that range from 2 percent to 15 percent of each missing deposit.

In 1998, the IRS adopted a new tax law provision that allows taxpayers 90 days
from the date of a tax penalty notice to designate how the IRS should apply their
deposits to taxes due. The details of this provision are contained within the IRS’
Revenue Procedure 99-10. The IRS also has a “98% Rule” that allows a taxpayer
to deposit at least 98 percent of the amount due and still avoid being assigned a
penalty for underpayment (though the missing amount must be paid shortly
thereafter). One can call the toll-free IRS number listed on the penalty notice to
tell the IRS how to allocate deposits in order to avoid the cascading penalties
problem; the 98% Rule can be used to shift money around between the various
payments due in order to further incrementally reduce the amount of the penalty.

The www.taxpenalty.com Web site, run by TimeValue Software, allows one
to enter all information pertinent to a tax penalty issue, calculates all payment
scenarios under Revenue Procedure 99-10, taking into account the 98% Rule, and
determines the ideal payment allocation that will result in the lowest possible
penalty payment. Given the permutations of the IRS penalty calculations, the
98% Rule, and the timing of payments made, the ideal lowest penalty amount is
extremely difficult to calculate, so this automated solution is quite useful for
determining the optimal payment situation. The site also prints all required
reports and describes the tax abatement process. The calculation and report gen-
eration services of this Web site are free until the tax penalty savings exceeds
$250, at which point the site charges a fee of $49 for savings in the range of $251
to $500, ranging up to a maximum fee of $399 for savings exceeding $10,000.

13-21 SUBSCRIBE TO AN ON-LINE TAX INFORMATION SERVICE

Congress is constantly tinkering with the tax laws, while the IRS continues to
issue a flood of interpretations in response to new tax situations. Consequently, it
is extremely difficult to stay current on which changes in the tax code apply to a
company’s specific circumstances. Many companies solve this problem by hiring
a CPA firm that specializes in taxation issues. However, the cost of this service is
extremely high; moreover, the people working for the CPA firm may not be aware
of ongoing operational issues at a company that may impact its tax situation.

A good alternative is to subscribe to an on-line tax information service, such
as the CCH Internet Tax Research Network (located at tax.cchgroup.com) or the
RIA Federal Tax Product Packages (located at www.riahome.com). These ser-
vices allow one to conduct searches on a wide range of tax topics, including the
IRS Code, executive orders, pending and enacted legislation, U.S. tax treaties,
and individual tax acts. These services update their databases of tax information
as soon as new information becomes available, which makes this a better source
of information than CD-based products. Also, search features allow one to
quickly hone in on all tax information pertaining to a specific topic.

The downside of these services is their cost, which generally fall into the
range of $2,000 to $5,000 per year, depending upon the scope of services pur-
chased. Also, these subscriptions only provide information—they are no substi-
tute for the expertise that can only be acquired through years of tax research, so a
company should continue to regularly consult with its tax advisors. Thus, an on-
line tax information service should be considered a supplement to other sources
of tax information and advice, rather than a replacement.

13-22 CREATE ACCOUNTING TRAINING TEAMS

A key problem for accounting managers is how to determine the correct amount
and type of training to require of their employees. Sending them to degree pro-
grams is too expensive and only provides relevant training for a small proportion
of the time spent being trained. Shorter programs are more targeted, but are still
expensive and may not directly relate to work requirements. For these reasons,
many accounting managers do not allow any training, or only under very
restricted circumstances. By doing so, they are limiting the skill sets of their
employees and not allowing them to fulfill personal career advancement goals,
which may result in increased employee turnover.

A solution to this problem is the use of internal accounting training teams.
The basic process is to conduct a periodic survey of employees and job functions
to determine what types of training programs are needed. A consultant or man-
ager-level employee then creates the general course syllabus for each training


282 General Best Practices

program (consultants can be useful here, since managers may not have sufficient
available time to work on syllabi). Each syllabus is then handed over to a group
of in-house accounting staff, who become responsible for creating the details of
each course, and teaching it. A manager is typically assigned to each course to
oversee its development and act as a mentor.

The primary advantage of this approach is that training can be precisely tai-
lored to a company’s exact needs, throwing out all irrelevant topics that might
otherwise be taught during a university-sponsored class. Because of their extreme
specificity, these classes are also usually quite short, allowing employees to either
fit them into daytime schedules or into abbreviated evening training sessions.
Examples of training topics under this approach could be process-centering tech-
niques, methodologies for finding cost-cutting approaches within specific trans-
actions, and training on specific functions within the company’s accounting soft-
ware. Also, by bringing together trainers from all parts of the accounting
organization, from administrative assistants to the CFO, the level of communica-
tion will likely improve. Finally, because all training classes are created and
taught in-house, the incremental cost of classes is reduced.

13-23 CREATE AN ONGOING TRAINING PROGRAM
FOR ALL ACCOUNTING PERSONNEL

The efficiency and effectiveness of an accounting department are based on many
factors, but a crucial one all too many controllers ignore is training. Many
accounting managers simply assume that their staffs have acquired all the knowl-
edge they need in college and in subsequent work experience and need no further
training of any kind. This belief is based on the erroneous assumption that all
accounting practices are the same, no matter where accountants work, and that
employees can be neatly swapped between jobs and companies with no addi-
tional training of any kind. Over the long term, this can have a major impact on
the accounting staff, for the following reasons:

¢ Accounting rule changes. The accounting profession is constantly reviewing
changes in how accounting transactions are completed and reported, resulting
in a multitude of rule changes, especially in the area of financial reporting.
Anyone who has not received formal training in these changes within the
past few years must receive training in all rules updates, while those not having
been trained in a decade or more will require comprehensive retraining.

* Computer-specific knowledge. There are many accounting software packages
in use, all with their own quirks and foibles. Each of these packages requires


13-23 Create an Ongoing Training Program 283

special training before employees will fully comprehend how to use them
most effectively, as well as (perhaps more importantly) what not to do, since
some systems require expert usage to run properly.

¢ Lack of management training. Accounting is not just clerical—it requires an
excellent knowledge of how to manage processes in a multitude of func-
tional areas, frequently including employees in outlying locations. Without
proper management training, there will almost certainly be gross inefficien-
cies and errors in the department.

¢ Lack of process training. The accounting function, above all others, deals
with processes, such as the revenue cycle or the purchasing cycle. All
employees in this department must have a clear knowledge of exactly how
these processes work so they can process information through them most
efficiently, as well as make modifications that will further increase the level
of efficiency. Though some of this knowledge can be gleaned through many
years of experience, it is best to cut short this interval through a training pro-
gram that imparts both the fundamentals and the detailed steps involved in
all key company processes.

¢ Lack of training for advanced positions. Though employees may be ade-
quately trained in their existing jobs, this does not mean that they are in any
way prepared to take over positions higher in the accounting hierarchy. With-
out the necessary training to prepare them for these positions, employees
may become frustrated and leave for other companies willing to provide the
training for more advanced and higher-paying jobs.

¢ Practices that are industry-specific. Many industries have accounting prac-
tices that are completely unique. An example of this is the gambling indus-
try, which has an extreme orientation toward the collection, handling, and
recording of cash coming from the gambling floor. In these industries, it is
dangerous to bring in people from other industries without first giving them
a sufficient degree of training in industry-specific accounting practices.

The types of training classes administered may vary considerably from the rote
accounting topics that are covered in a traditional business college. For example,
Allied-Signal includes the following topics in its accounting and finance curriculum:

¢ Accounting for business combinations
¢ Activity-based management

¢ Business controls

* Cash-flow management

* Coaching and career management

¢ Controllership


284 General Best Practices

¢ Diversity

¢ E-commerce

¢ Financial planning and analysis
¢ Global finance

¢ Management accounting

¢ Mergers and acquisitions

¢ Six sigma

¢ Supply-chain management

¢ Taxation

¢ Revenue-chain management

All of these reasons sum up strongly in favor of a detailed and prolonged
training program for the entire accounting department covering such areas as
software, processes, new pronouncements by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB), industry-specific issues, and general management training.

The best way to set up a training program is to make a list of all positions in the
accounting department and determine the training strengths and weaknesses of
every person occupying those positions. Then a master list of all possible training
must be assembled, with the required training for each person noted on the master
list. An example of such a list is shown in Exhibit 13.8, which lists the training pro-
gram for a variety of software modules in an accounting software package. It is also
useful to maintain a list of credit hours for continuing professional education, in
case employees want to pursue or maintain professional accreditation.

The main problem with training programs is that employees usually must be
forced to complete their scheduled training, since they find that there is not
enough time in the midst of their other activities to fit it in. To avoid this issue, the
controller should schedule a monthly review of completed training to ensure that
all employees are meeting their training goals. Also, one should incorporate train-
ing goals into the targets that employees must meet each year in order to be given
pay raises or bonuses. Further, the internal audit staff may also schedule an occa-
sional review of all training records to ensure that employees are indeed complet-
ing their training work and not falsely reporting training hours that never hap-
pened. When combined, all of these measures will ensure a thorough and
comprehensive training program that will improve employee knowledge, espe-
cially in regard to improving and managing systems, while also reducing the risk
of employee turnover.

13-24 CREATE COMPUTER-BASED TRAINING MOVIES

There are several major problems with any in-house training program. It must be
carefully scheduled so that the maximum number of people can attend (which
means that some people will not be able to attend, or at least will be seriously
inconvenienced). Also, an expensive trainer and training facility must be used.
Furthermore, people must travel to the training site for classes, which may entail
great expense. All of these problems can be avoided through the use of computer-
based training movies.

A computer-based training movie is one that replicates on-screen the actions
of someone who is walking through a standard set of activities, while explaining
each action through a microphone. The resulting movie will show a user exactly
what is being done to process a transaction (or some other activity) while the
accompanying voice recording explains what is going on. Just as is the case with
a movie that is inserted into a video cassette recorder, this movie format contains
on-screen buttons for rewind, pause, play, and fast forward. Each movie is easily
created —just plot out the steps to be followed during the movie, practice them a
few times, and then press the “record” button and start recording the movie. The
audio portion of the movie can be added concurrently, or at a later time.

By storing computer-based training movies at a central intranet location, a
company can make it available to all employees at all company locations.
Employees can download it at their leisure and review those portions about which
they are uncertain. When training movies are made for a wide range of company
functions, they can be set up in an index format on the intranet site, so that an
entire training program can be made available to employees on a wide range of
topics. The only problems with computer-based movies are that they take up a
large amount of computer storage space, and that all accessing computers require
audio cards and speakers. However, these are minor cost issues.

The software that is currently available for making computer-based movies
includes ScreenCam by Lotus (www.lotus.com), HyperCam by Hyperionics
(www.hyperionics.com), and Camtasia™ Recorder and Producer by TechSmith®
(www.techsmith.com). Even the most expensive of these packages costs only $150.

13-25 IMPLEMENT CROSS-TRAINING FOR
MISSION-CRITICAL ACTIVITIES

There are a number of crucial accounting activities that will cause a significant
amount of disturbance within a company if they are not completed on time,
every time. Examples of these activities are payroll, since employees will
refuse to work unless they are paid, and accounts payable, for suppliers will
refuse to provide additional goods and services unless they are paid. In these


Total Impact of Best Practices on General Accounting Functions 287

cases and others, the greatest risk is that only one person knows how to process
transactions. If that person leaves the company or is incapacitated for any rea-
son, there can be a serious system failure that will quickly bring the entire com-
pany to a grinding halt.

The best way to avoid this dependency on a single person is to implement
cross-training, using other accounting employees. By doing so, there is far less
risk that mission-critical activities will not be performed in a reliable manner,
which greatly reduces the chance that any key activity will not be completed on
time. To do so, there should be a schedule of key activities for which there is a
listing of required training elements. The controller should identify those per-
sonnel who are most qualified to act as back-ups, put them through the training
regimen, and ensure that they receive continual retraining, so they can easily
step into the needed jobs. A small pay hike for those employees receiving cross-
training will ensure their enthusiastic participation in this system. The key factor
to remember is that training alone does not make for a good back-up person—
only continual hands-on practice under the direct tutelage of the person who is
currently responsible for the work will ensure that this best practice will work.

The only people who ever oppose this practice are those who are currently in
charge of mission-critical functions. This is because they feel more valuable if
they are the only ones who can complete a task and will feel less useful if there is
someone else who can also do the same work. To overcome this problem requires
a great deal of tact and diplomacy. Sometimes they continue to be hostile to the
concept and must be removed to other positions while their replacements figure
out the system without any support at all. These are difficult alternatives, but
must be followed through if there is to be an adequate degree of cross-training in
key functional areas.

TOTAL IMPACT OF BEST PRACTICES ON GENERAL
ACCOUNTING FUNCTIONS

This section covers the impact of the best practices described in this chapter on
the general administration of the accounting department.

Accounting processes attract most of the attention in this chapter, since there
are best practices here for outsourcing some processes, using process-centering
in other cases, and consolidating others. They are noted in Exhibit 13.9. The manner
in which these best practices should be installed is that all outsourcing opportunities
should be identified and completed first, followed by any needed consolidation of
activities into the smallest number of locations. By taking these steps first, a com-
pany does not waste time reviewing existing processes that are about to be elimi-
nated or moved elsewhere. After these tasks are completed, it is time to conduct a
thorough review of all processes, increase the number of process tasks assigned

to individual employees (i.e., process-centering), and then set up a continual
process review system so that they are constantly analyzed for further improve-
ments. By taking this approach, one can achieve a remarkable improvement in
the efficiency of all accounting processes.

There are also several best practices related to accounting personnel, which
involve training and job standardization. They are shown in the middle of Exhibit
13.9. By implementing them all, one can not only arrive at a department that
knows exactly what to do and when to do it, but also one that experiences a much
lower degree of turnover. The smaller number of employee departures is caused
by the reduced level of anxiety that goes hand in hand with the reduced number
of problems that are the end result of standardizing jobs and increasing the level
of training.

SUMMARY

This chapter covered a number of best practices that address problems in three
main areas— processes, personnel, and reporting.

Many best practices covered issues in the area of accounting process, with
principal recommendations covering the outsourcing of smaller functions, con-
solidating accounting functions, setting up a database of contract terms, and
focusing closely on the organization of employees around processes. These
changes can bring about a major improvement in the efficiency of accounting
processes.

Other best practices focused on accounting employees. A highly focused and
organized training program is needed, especially when combined with cross-
training for key activities, a policies and procedures manual, and a calendar of
activities. These improvements will help to convert the accounting department
into a highly knowledgeable and well-coordinated group.

Finally, three best practices target changes in the reporting function. One
uses on-line reporting to ensure that information is disseminated as inexpensively
and widely as possible, while Balanced Scorecard and function measurements
are needed to determine the progress of the corporation as a whole and of indi-
vidual departments, respectively, in achieving their goals. Though the reporting
changes will not have an immediate impact on the efficiency of the accounting
department, they will assist in informing management of companywide activities,
resulting in better control over overall operations.


Chapter 14

 

General Ledger
Best Practices

In most of this book, the primary basis for best practices is simplification in
order to achieve an enhanced level of efficiency. Though there are best prac-
tices that can streamline the general ledger in a similar manner, this is one of
the rare cases where pursuing a higher degree of complexity will achieve a
greater overall benefit for the entire company. The two best practices that follow
this approach are restructuring the general ledger to allow for the use of activity-
based costing, and using it as a data warehouse. In both cases, there are significant
start-up costs and much more work for the accounting staff, but the level of infor-
mation that this practice provides to the rest of the organization is greatly
enhanced. Thus, there are a few situations where greater cost and complexity
can be beneficial.

In addition, there are the usual streamlining actions to reduce the work
needed to maintain the general ledger. These best practices include restricting the
use of journal entries, automating interfaces with subsidiary ledgers, and simpli-
fying the chart of accounts. Though all of these measures will certainly reduce
the work of the general ledger accountant, one should strongly consider adding
the best practices for activity-based costing and data warehousing, which will
increase that person’s work, because it will be so beneficial to the remainder of
the company.

This chapter covers best practices for the general ledger function, as well as
a series of implementation issues for each best practice, which are discussed in
the next section.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES FOR GENERAL LEDGER
BEST PRACTICES

This section describes the general level of implementation difficulty for all of the
best practices discussed in this chapter. Two levels of implementation difficulty
are covered in Exhibit 14.1, which shows the general level cost and duration to
implement each best practice.

In general, the level of implementation difficulty is higher for general ledger
best practices than for other functional areas because changes in this area either

involve major programming work or significant alterations to the way in which a
company conducts its business. For example, one best practice is to switch the
chart of accounts over to a structure that will allow a company to accumulate
information for an activity-based costing system more easily; however, altering
the chart of accounts always involves setting up new methods for collecting data,
which can require major procedural changes throughout a company. In short,
since the general ledger is the core data collection point in a company, alterations
to it will have a ripple effect that may impact distant corners of the organization
that the change initiator never anticipated.

Though many of the implementations listed in Exhibit 14.1 are described as
being of long duration or expensive, many of them can still be cost-effective

ways to improve the efficiency of the accounting department. However, given the
potential costs, it is mandatory, in this functional area, above all others, that a
controller conduct a thorough investigation and comparison of the costs and ben-
efits associated with any best practice-related changes. An implementation
should proceed only after this step has been taken.

14-1 ELIMINATE SMALL-BALANCE ACCOUNTS V Author's Choice

If the general ledger accountant is in the habit of maintaining a record of all the
transactions in all accounts, there can be a considerable workload in store if there
are many accounts. This practice is particularly common for balance sheet accounts,
where it is necessary to keep track of all asset and liability records so that they can
be reviewed during the year-end audit. If there are fewer accounts, there is less main-
tenance work needed to update a listing of the detailed records in each account.

Accordingly, a minor and easily implemented best practice is to periodically
review the balances in the balance sheet accounts and merge them into larger
accounts (or expense them) if the current balances are quite small. This task can
be included in the financial statement preparation procedure as a standard item so
that someone reviews the size of accounts on a regular basis and eliminates a few
as necessary. There are no downsides to this best practice since it requires mini-
mal work, reduces the clutter in the balance sheet, and does not interfere with the
proper recording of information.

14-2 MODIFY ACCOUNT CODE STRUCTURE FOR STORAGE
OF ABC INFORMATION

The general ledger accountant is frequently drawn into any activity-based costing
(ABC) project because of his or her knowledge of the existing account structure.
This accountant is commonly asked to set up a mapping program that translates
the regular chart of accounts into a different (sometimes much different) chart of
accounts that will be used to compile information for an ABC analysis. This
analysis then compiles the costs of various products or activities throughout the
company, which usually results in better management decisions and a greater
level of profitability. Though this sounds like a reasonable task, involvement in an
ABC project requires a startlingly large amount of time, perhaps even full-time
participation for a number of months. The reason for such a heavy involvement is
that the existing chart of accounts rarely accumulates data in the same way that
an ABC analysis requires. For example, a traditional chart of accounts stores
expense information by department, whereas an ABC system needs to have this
information stored by activity center (such as a machine). Thus, when an ABC


14-3 Reduce the Chart of Accounts 293

system is installed, the general ledger accountant may not only expect a consider-
able increase in the current workload, but may even require a replacement to fill
in for all previous work while the ABC project is continuing.

A possible solution to this change in workload is to alter the chart of
accounts, at least in part, so that information is stored in the manner the ABC
system uses. By storing information in the ABC format right away, there is no
need for the general ledger accountant to spend additional time reformatting it.
This can be quite a difficult best practice to implement, for several reasons.
First, it requires the transfer of expense information from old accounts to new
ones, as well as the alteration of all entries to the general ledger, so that all new
information is redirected in a similar manner. Also, all reports derived from the
general ledger must be altered so that they draw information from the new
accounts instead. The greatest problem of all is that the recipients of the revised
reports may not be at all pleased to find that the information that they are accus-
tomed to receiving has been substantially altered. For example, a department
manager may find that there is no longer a department expense report, but
instead an expense report grouped by machine. This alteration is not usually
taken well by company management. The best way around all of these difficul-
ties is to set up automatic distributions within the general ledger so that
expenses are still routed to the same accounts, but the accounts are then allo-
cated out to a different set of ABC accounts for further ABC analysis. Unfortu-
nately, the account allocation feature is not normally available in less expensive
general ledger accounting software packages, so this option is usually only
available to larger corporations. A lesser alternative is to alter just a small por-
tion of general ledger accounts so that they can be used for ABC work, leaving
the main accounts as they are and relying on a manual conversion of data for
these accounts. This approach has the advantage of not altering the existing
financial reports to any significant degree, but still requires a considerable
amount of work by the general ledger accountant.

Despite all of the problems with converting the general ledger format to
accommodate an ABC system, this is still worthwhile in many cases. The reason
is that though there is no increase in efficiency for the general ledger function
(quite the contrary), there will be a rapid and smooth flow of information into the
ABC system, which will result in better management decisions, which in turn
will have a direct impact on the profitability of the entire organization.

14-3 REDUCE THE CHART OF ACCOUNTS WV Author’s Choice

All too many organizations are burdened with an immense chart of accounts.
Instead of having a short list of accounts in which to store information—such as
100 or 200 accounts — many organizations have a convoluted and lengthy chart of


294 General Ledger Best Practices

accounts that covers many pages. The sheer length of such a list introduces a
number of problems into the general ledger function. One is that it is difficult to
put numbers into the same accounts consistently time after time. Instead, they are
recorded in different accounts, resulting in very poor comparability of informa-
tion across time. Another issue is that it can be very difficult to train a new gen-
eral ledger accountant in the use of a very complicated chart of accounts; during
the training period, it is very likely that the accountant will make mistakes in
recording financial information into the correct accounts, resulting in inaccurate
financial statements. It is also more expensive to audit a long chart of accounts
since the outside auditors must spend more time reviewing more accounts. Fur-
thermore, writing a new report with general ledger information is quite difficult if
the information is being drawn from a veritable maze of accounts. In short, a
plague of problems accompanies an excessively long chart of accounts.

The best practice that resolves this problem is one that takes a fair amount
of work to implement. Though it seems simple—just reduce the number of
active accounts in the chart of accounts—there are ancillary issues that require
additional work. One problem with reducing the chart is that users may still
continue to code expenses to the old accounts, if only out of habit. To stop this
from happening, the old accounts that are being retired must be blocked from
further use in the computer system. Though most computer systems now have
this blocking feature, it is useful to determine its presence before proceeding
further with an implementation. Another issue is that when the chart is reduced,
it is much more difficult to create historical reports to compare account bal-
ances to those of previous periods. For example, if five accounts are merged
into one consolidated account, it becomes impossible to show how the balance
in the new account compares to the old balances in five accounts, unless the
general ledger copies all of the information to an electronic spreadsheet and
manually regroups the information, a time-consuming task. There is no good
way around this problem, unless the existing accounting software has a report-
ing feature that allows old accounts to be grouped for comparison purposes (a
rare feature). This is a particular problem if the accounts are merged in the mid-
dle of a company’s reporting year so that it is not even possible to compare
financial results from month to month. The best solution to this problem is to
undertake major chart of account conversions only at the very beginning of a
reporting year so that there is no intra-year reporting problem. Another way to
resolve the problem is to fix the chart of accounts over a number of years by
eliminating only a small number of accounts each year, which does not impact
the comparability of accounts in any one year to any great degree. A final issue
with reducing the chart of accounts is that information may be stored in an
account strictly for inclusion in a report that has some special purpose. If the
account is discontinued, the report can no longer be completed, which may be a
source of irritation to the report recipient. To avoid this issue, it is necessary to
review all reports generated from the general ledger and determine which


14-4 Use Identical Chart of Accounts for Subsidiaries 295

accounts are used to create them. If the information in these special accounts is
truly indispensable, they should be left alone.

Though a number of problems have been noted that can arise when the chart
of accounts is streamlined, this is still a best practice immensely worthy of con-
sideration. It is especially useful for older companies with many departments or
subsidiaries, for these have frequently accumulated a large number of stray
accounts over the years that should certainly be researched and eliminated. By
doing so, it is much easier to maintain the general ledger.

14-4 USE IDENTICAL CHART OF ACCOUNTS
FOR SUBSIDIARIES VW Author’s Choice

If a company has a number of subsidiaries, the general ledger accountant will
have a much more difficult time at the end of the financial reporting period,
because the results of each subsidiary must be translated into the chart of
accounts structure of the corporate parent. This can involve an enormous amount
of work, because the information the subsidiaries send in may be in a chart of
accounts structure that is so different from the one the parent uses that it is a mat-
ter of pure guesswork by the accountant to determine the correct accounts into
which the subsidiary data should be recorded. This is a particularly galling prob-
lem if the subsidiaries are in an entirely different line of business, for this means
that the chart of accounts may be substantially different; thus, consolidating
account numbers is more of a problem if a company acquires disparate compa-
nies, as opposed to acquiring companies that are in the same industry.

There are several variations on the same best practice that will resolve this
problem, as noted in the following bullet points. They range from merely requir-
ing the permission of the corporate parent before a subsidiary alters its chart of
accounts any further to requiring the substitution of the existing chart with the
one the corporate parent uses. The bullet points are listed in ascending order of
conformance, with the least amount of conformance being the easiest to imple-
ment and complete conformance being the most difficult to install. The particular
variation selected may be dependent on the speed with which a company is buy-
ing other companies, since a complete replacement of a chart of accounts can be
a major undertaking and may not be possible if the rate of acquisition is
extremely rapid. The best practice options are as follows:

¢ Require permission to make account changes. It may be necessary to leave
the current situation alone, perhaps because there are too many subsidiaries
and too few resources available to reset the chart of accounts structure across
all subsidiaries. In this situation, the easiest step is to issue a blanket order to
all subsidiaries that they cannot make further changes to their charts of


296 General Ledger Best Practices

accounts without permission from the corporate parent—in other words, the
main action is not to make the situation any worse than it already is. This is
an extremely minor action to take, since it is a rare event for a company to
create new accounts once the basic chart of accounts has been completed.

¢ Use awritten map to lay out how accounts are linked. A more advanced level
of activity, which can also incorporate the first bullet point, is to create a map
that traces each account number used by every subsidiary to the corresponding
account number in the corporate parent’s chart of accounts. Though only a
manual tool, not an automated one, this is still a very important way to create
consistent entries through many accounting periods. To make this approach
even more effective, there should be a standardized journal entry form for
each subsidiary that lists both sets of account numbers so that the general
ledger accountant only has to fill in the form and enter it into the computer.

¢ Have subsidiaries convert results to corporate parent’s chart of accounts. An
excellent approach for organizations that do not like to impose an excessive
level of control onto their subsidiaries is to let them use any account code
structure that they want and just require them to make the conversion to the
parent’s chart of accounts when submitting period-end information. This
approach is a benign one many companies use, for it avoids the effort of a
complete standardization while still ensuring that the parent company receives
the information that it needs. It can also be completed in short order, merely
requiring a visit from corporate headquarters to work with the local account-
ing staff to create an account code conversion table the local staff will use to
submit data to the corporate parent.

¢ Have subsidiaries enter their data directly into the parent’s general ledger.
This approach is similar to the preceding one in that the subsidiaries can
keep their own charts of accounts but must submit their reporting informa-
tion in the corporate parent’s format. The difference here is that the sub-
sidiaries are given dial-up computer access to the corporate parent’s general
ledger, into which they are expected to enter the period-end data themselves.
This approach presents the risk of someone entering incorrect information
into the computer system but avoids the need for extra data-entry work by
the corporate general ledger accountant. Instead, the people entering the
information are the ones who know the most about it, which means that there
is less likelihood of a conversion or data-entry error being made. This best
practice is described in more detail later, in the section ““Have Subsidiaries
Update Their Own Data in the Central General Ledger.”

* Convert all subsidiaries to a common chart of accounts. The best way to
ensure complete standardization is to impose the chart of accounts of the
parent onto the subsidiaries. This can involve a massive amount of work, for
each accounting system must be reset to use the new accounts. This will also
probably destroy all historical reporting comparisons, which must use the
old account numbers. Some subsidiaries may also be in such a different line


14-5 Use Data Warehouse for Report Distribution 297

of business that the new chart of accounts is quite unsuitable for recording
information, requiring the accounting staff to “shoehorn” data into accounts
that do not agree exactly with the account descriptions. Many companies
find this approach to be much too difficult and expensive to be worthwhile
and will use one of the preceding options instead.

Thus, there is quite a range of options available for converting the chart of
accounts of a subsidiary to that of the parent. The exact option taken will depend on
the level of effort and resources that the parent is willing to put into this effort. Some
of the easier options are quite as reliable as the most difficult, making them worthy
of careful consideration when picking from the range of options presented here.

14-5 USE DATA WAREHOUSE FOR REPORT DISTRIBUTION

Larger organizations, especially those with multiple locations or subsidiaries,
commonly expend a great deal of time compiling and distributing reports to
employees. This problem arises because each location frequently has its own
general ledger, from which the information is drawn. If any of the information
from multiple locations is to be combined to create summary-level reports, then
either a custom interface must be built to combine the data or else it must be man-
ually combined and inserted into a new report.

An excellent method for avoiding this trouble is to dump selected data from
all of the general ledgers into a central data warehouse. This involves the use of
many customized interfaces that frequently pull the data out of outlying locations
and push it into the data warehouse, so that it contains only the most current
information. Then a set of reporting programs frequently (perhaps every few
minutes, depending on how it would downgrade system performance) accesses
the data warehouse to refresh the information stored in a set of standard reports,
which in turn are made available to employees through the company intranet.

This elaborate shifting and recompiling of data results in very “fresh” data
that employees can use at once, and takes the accounting department completely
out of the business of repetitively compiling reports—though it may still be asked
to create new reports for posting to the intranet site. A key change after this sys-
tem is installed is that the accounting staff will find itself spending much more
time cleaning up the data that goes into the data warehouse. The reason is that
manually compiled reports give the accounting staff time to review the data and
fix any obvious anomalies before they reach the user; however, this automated
reporting system does not allow the accounting staff this luxury, so now its focus
must change toward ensuring that the data is always correct.

A different approach to the data warehouse is noted in the “Use the General
Ledger as a Data Warehouse” section later in this chapter, where one can see


298 General Ledger Best Practices

that extra data can be added to an existing general ledger, rather than exporting
the general ledger to another location. This alternative is more usable in situa-
tions where there is only one general ledger in use, and so is more applicable to
smaller companies.

14-6 USE FORMS/RATES DATA WAREHOUSE
FOR AUTOMATED TAX FILINGS

Any organization that operates in a number of states will find that an inordinate
number of sales and income tax returns must be filed, not to mention a plethora of
lesser forms. The traditional way to meet these filing requirements is to either
keep a staff of tax preparation personnel on hand or else outsource some or all of
these chores to a supplier. Either approach represents a significant cost. An alter-
native worth exploring is to store tax rates and forms in a database that can be
used to automatically prepare tax returns in conjunction with other accounting
information that is stored in either a general ledger or a data warehouse.

To make this best practice operational, there must first be a common data-
base containing all of the information that would normally be included on a tax
return. This may call for some restructuring of the chart of accounts, as well as
the centralization of companywide data into a data warehouse (see the preceding
best practice). This is no small task, since the information needed by each state
may vary slightly from the requirements of other states, calling for subtle
changes in the storage of data throughout the organization that will yield the
appropriate information for reporting purposes.

The next step is to obtain tax rate information and store it in a central database.
This information can be manually located by accessing the tax agency Web sites of
all 50 states, but is more easily obtained in electronic format from any of the national
tax reporting services. This information can then be stored in the forms/rates data
warehouse. An additional step is to create a separate program for each of the tax
reports, so that a computer report is issued that mimics the reporting format used by
each state. Then the information can be manually transferred from the computer
report to a printout of the PDF file of each state’s tax form. For those programming
staffs with a large amount of available time, it is also possible to create a report for-
mat that exactly mirrors each state tax form and that can be printed out, with all tax
information enclosed within it, and immediately mailed out.

The trouble with this best practice is the exceptionally high programming
cost associated with obtaining a complete automated solution. There are so many
tax forms to be converted to a digital format that the development task is consid-
erable. Accordingly, it is more cost-effective to determine those tax forms that
share approximately the same information and to develop an automated solution
for them first. Any remaining tax forms that would require special programming


14-7 Use the General Ledger as a Data Warehouse 299

to automate should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine if it is cost-
beneficial to complete further programming work or to leave a few stray reports
for the tax preparation staff to complete by hand.

14-7 USE THE GENERAL LEDGER AS A DATA WAREHOUSE

When issuing financial reports, a controller draws all of the financial information
from a single source, the general ledger. However, there are usually a number of
operating statistics, such as headcount, turnover percentages, scrap, and the like
that must be accumulated from a variety of sources before they can be brought
together into a coherent group and inserted into the financial statements. These
can be quite difficult to accumulate at the last moment and must be added manu-
ally to the financial statements since they are not stored in the general ledger, the
primary source from which the statements are drawn. The reporting problem
becomes worse if management is accustomed to printing financial reports on its
own, for any operating statistics will not appear on them, necessitating a sudden
and unscheduled accumulation of this information by the accounting staff in
order to supplement the existing reports. Thus, nonfinancial data can introduce
some inefficiency into the production of financial statements.

The best practice that resolves this issue is to create additional records in the
general ledger for the storage of nonfinancial information. This is more com-
monly known as a data warehouse, since data of all kinds can be stored there.
When in place, this arrangement allows a company to store all the operating data
it desires in the same place as its financial data, which means that any reports
accessing financial data can automatically include operating data as well. Since
all possible information is listed on the reports, there is no need to supplement
them with additional, manually compiled reports. This is a much more satisfac-
tory state of affairs since all information and reporting is centralized.

There are some problems with changing a general ledger into a data ware-
house. One is that the existing software may not allow for this arrangement; if the
software is provided by a third party and regularly updated, there may be no way
to alter the situation without an appeal to the supplier to include a data warehous-
ing feature in its next update of the software. Another problem is that the existing
financial reports must be altered to include the new information that will now be
stored in the general ledger. Yet another issue is deciding who will update the
operations information and how it will be added to the general ledger. For exam-
ple, if it is deemed necessary to record the monthly inventory turnover rate at
each of a dozen facilities, who will collect and input this data? The answer is usu-
ally either to allow each department or facility to forward this information, have
the internal audit team (which is more objective in reporting disappointing
results) do it, or have the former do it with periodic reviews by the latter. It may


300 General Ledger Best Practices

also be possible either to give these people direct access to the statistics accounts
in the general ledger so that they can make these entries themselves or (best of
all) to construct automated interfaces to whichever local systems are already
accumulating this information.

Thus, the main problem is not having a general ledger that will accommo-
date the data warehousing concept; the other problems are either surmounted dur-
ing the implementation or can be eliminated through automation or bringing in
the assistance of the internal audit department. If these problems can be over-
come, using the general ledger as a data warehouse becomes an effective way to
manage and report on all kinds of key management information.

14-8 RESTRICT USE OF JOURNAL ENTRIES

Many general ledger accountants spend a large part of their time researching why
journal entries have been made. This is an especially galling problem if journal
entries were made by someone else, because there may be no record of why they
were entered or even of who made the entry. Also, if the computer system has a
“drill-down” capability for researching general ledger information in detail (see
the “Create General Ledger Drill-Down Capability” section later in this chapter),
an information search may end at the journal entry, with no explanation for why
the entry was made. This is an uncomfortable state of affairs for a general ledger
accountant, who must report back to anyone requesting information from the
general ledger saying that he or she does not know the nature of an account bal-
ance. Besides being embarrassing, it also takes time to research.

An easy best practice to implement is to totally restrict the use of journal
entries to the general ledger accountant. By doing so, this person can research
each request for a journal entry to verify that it is valid, make sure that the correct
accounts are debited and credited, and include a description with the journal
entry. This approach virtually eliminates all stray or undocumented journal
entries from the system. Though it should not cause any problems, it may be dif-
ficult to implement if the computer system does not allow the journal entry fea-
ture to be restricted to one person—this depends on the type of computer security
system included in the software.

Restricting the use of journal entries leads to cleaner and more fully docu-
mented general ledger information that is maintained much more easily.

14-9 Have Subsidiaries Update Their Own Data 301

14-9 HAVE SUBSIDIARIES UPDATE THEIR OWN DATA
IN THE CENTRAL GENERAL LEDGER

A lengthy task for any general ledger accountant who must consolidate the
results of subsidiaries is to input the general ledger of each one into the general
ledger of the corporate parent. This can be a lengthy and arduous task, as well
as one that is easily subject to error. The typical consolidation requires a very
large journal entry for each subsidiary, possibly requiring over a hundred
accounts. If there is any problem with the data entry, the entire entry must be
reviewed to find the mistake. If there are many subsidiaries, there are many
entries to make; if there is a time crunch associated with producing financial
statements, it is extremely likely that all of the data-entry work required of the
general ledger accountant will be a bottleneck for the timely production of
those statements.

The solution to this quandary is to hand the data-entry chore over to the sub-
sidiaries. They can be given access to the computer system of the corporate parent,
with modems, as well as password access to the general ledger, and then enter
their financial results directly into the computer system. The general ledger
accountant thereby avoids all data-entry work related to the subsidiaries and only
has to analyze his or her own data inputs to see if there are any unusual items. By
having each subsidiary enter its own information, the data can be entered much
more quickly, resulting in the elimination of the workflow bottleneck associated
with this task. In short, a relatively simple system change can improve the effi-
ciency of periodic corporate consolidations.

There are a few issues to consider before attempting this best practice, however.
First, there is a minor expense associated with giving modems to all subsidiaries.
This expense will include the cost of a direct phone line for each computer so
equipped (though this also makes those computers useful for other modem-related
tasks, perhaps justifying the cost in this manner). Also, there must be password pro-
tection for anyone dialing into the main computer system, since there is always a
tisk of someone hacking into the computer and destroying or accessing sensitive
data. Another issue is that, by giving access to many people, the number of users
accessing the system at one time may rise, which may require the purchase of addi-
tional user licenses (if the system is a third-party package that uses a licensing fee
arrangement). Finally, all the new users must be trained in how to make a journal
entry in the corporate computer system, which may require nothing more than an
instruction sheet, but which may require travel to all locations to conduct a short
training class. If all of these issues can be dealt with at minimal cost, then having
subsidiaries enter their own data into the corporate general ledger can improve the
efficiency of that function.

14-10 CONSTRUCT AUTOMATED INTERFACES TO SOFTWARE
THAT SUMMARIZES INTO THE GENERAL LEDGER

A large number of transactions must be moved from subsidiary ledgers to the
general ledger at the end of each accounting period. In most cases, there is some
reasonable degree of integration so that this transfer of information occurs auto-
matically. However, the majority of organizations have a few outlying ledgers
that are not directly connected to the general ledger; for example, the fixed assets
register or payroll. In these instances, the general ledger accountant must wade
through a considerable pile of information to determine the correct amounts to
shift into the general ledger. This is a time-consuming process and one that is
subject to error.

It may be possible to construct an automated interface between these outlying
ledgers and the general ledger. By doing so, there is a considerable advantage in
eliminating the time required to move data to the general ledger manually, partic-
ularly important if an accounting department is committed to reducing the time
needed to issue financial statements. Unfortunately, because of the programming
required, this can be both a difficult and expensive best practice to implement.
The company’s programming staff must analyze the interface requirements,
design the interface, program it, and test it, all of which can add up to a cost that
greatly exceeds the benefit of having the automation. The best cases in which this
is still a viable option are for a large company that can afford the cost, an organi-
zation that faces a very difficult manual transfer of information, or (best of all)
where a third-party interface is already on the market, which can be quickly lay-
ered on top of the existing software to make the interface a reality. If any of these
cases are present, then the automated interface best practice should be completed.

14-11 CREATE GENERAL LEDGER DRILL-DOWN CAPABILITY

A common problem for the general ledger accountant is the relative degree of
effort required to extract information from the general ledger. For example, if
someone makes an inquiry regarding the exact nature of the expenses recorded in
the office supplies expense account, the accountant reviews the information listed
in the general ledger, which probably shows no more than the total amount of
accounts payable posted on a given day attributable to the office supplies account,
then goes to the accounts payable register to obtain information about the exact
invoices that were charged to office supplies, and then pulls the invoices from the
filing cabinet in which they reside—all this to answer the simple request, “Give me
the detail for the office supplies account.” Given the number of steps involved, it
is obvious that a number of information requests of this kind (which are espe-


14-12 Overlay with a Consolidation and Reporting Package 303

cially common right after the financial statements are distributed) can completely
overload the general ledger accountant.

Installing a drill-down capability in the general ledger software is the best
way to surmount this problem. The drill-down system allows one to position the
cursor on the field on the computer screen for which the user wants to find addi-
tional information; the user then presses a button, and the next most detailed level
of information appears on the screen. There may be several levels of information
that can be accessed in this manner, allowing a user to “drill down” through the
various levels until the needed information is obtained—hence the name of this
best practice.

Though an obvious godsend for anyone who must research detailed informa-
tion through the general ledger, this is not an easy item to install in an existing com-
puter system. In essence, the computer programming staff must redesign large por-
tions of the general ledger programming code so that the field in a high-level screen
is automatically linked to a screen that contains more detailed information, requir-
ing a web of cross-indexes to a multitude of screens (which may be located in other
software packages) before users have a comprehensive drill-down capability. This
is a major programming project, especially if the drill-down capability is given to a
large number of data items, which means that there will be a large number of cross-
indexes. This option is virtually impossible to implement if a company is using a
third-party software package since any periodic update of the packaged software by
the supplier will automatically wipe out all custom programming that the local pro-
gramming staff has done since the last update was installed.

In short, the drill-down capability greatly increases a general ledger accoun-
tant’s overall level of efficiency, but it requires either a large amount of internal
programming time or the purchase of packaged accounting software that already
contains this feature.

14-12 OVERLAY THE GENERAL LEDGER WITHA
CONSOLIDATION AND REPORTING PACKAGE

It can be extremely difficult to report on the consolidated results of a distributed
company, since there may be a number of different general ledger software pack-
ages in use, some of which run in different computer environments. Though it is
possible to manually consolidate this information, it is a tedious and error-prone
process that also requires a considerable lag time before consolidated reports can
be generated. Also, if anyone has a question about the resulting report, the
accounting staff must research the details in the underlying general ledgers and
then create another manual report—all of which takes yet more time. There are
two ways to avoid this problem. One approach is to create customized interfaces
from each general ledger to a centralized data warehouse, as discussed earlier in


304 General Ledger Best Practices

this chapter under the “Use a Data Warehouse for Report Distribution” heading.
This method is expensive to implement, and requires a considerable amount of
programming time. An alternative is to overlay the general ledger with packaged
consolidation and reporting software.

This type of software is sold by Hyperion, and is called the Hyperion Enterprise
software, as well as the ancillary Hyperion Financial Analysis Solutions software.
These packages can be found on the company’s Web site at www.hyperion.com.
The software can be linked to any number of general ledgers through published
application programming interfaces, as well as through Hyperion’s integration
tool, Hyperion Application Link. Once the data is combined in the Hyperion
Enterprise software, it can conduct automatic currency translations, intercompany
eliminations, European Monetary Union dual currency reporting, and consolidation
tracking. When combined with the Hyperion Enterprise Reporting software, it
can also allow users to drill down through the data in issued reports to the under-
lying transactional detail, as well as export reports to electronic spreadsheets, to
the PDF (Portable Document Format) or HTML file formats, or post them directly
to a Web site for general access.

All of these advantages are available through a packaged system, rather than
a custom-designed data warehouse whose rollout time and cost is much higher.
The primary issues with the Hyperion solution are that some interfaces with out-
lying general ledgers will likely require customized programming, and the cost of
the software.

14-13 USE AUTOMATED ERROR-CHECKING

Despite the best possible training and experience, it is still possible, if not likely,
for a general ledger accountant to enter incorrect information into the general
ledger, or to not catch incorrect information others have entered. This informa-
tion may not be caught until it appears in the preliminary financial statements,
necessitating a hurried investigation and correction, which delays the completion
and delivery of the statements. Given the volume of transactions summarized in
the general ledger, it would take a miraculous accountant to catch all possible
irregularities before they are reported for the rest of the company to see in the
financial statements.

The best practice that helps to eliminate some of these irregularities is using
automated error-checking. This approach can take a variety of forms. One is that
the journal entry input screen can contain controls over the size of entries that are
allowed or the accounts to which entries are made. For example, any entry over
$1 million may be automatically rejected, as would any entry to retained earnings
(though with an override by a person with the appropriate password, since some-
times these preset boundaries will be exceeded). Another option is for the system


Total Impact of Best Practices on the General Ledger Function 305

to allow only a preapproved set of journal entries, all with preset accounts to
which changes will be allowed. All other journal entries will require a special
password to enter. Yet another approach is to use a report writer to explore all of
the transactions that have been entered into the general ledger, sort through the
ones that exceed preset boundaries, and issue them in a report. For example, a
report could extract all travel expenses of more than $5,000 dollars, or all fixed
asset additions less than the minimum capitalization limit. A report can also com-
pare all expenses to year-to-date or period-budgeted amounts and only show
those that exceed their budgeted amounts. By running these reports regularly, the
general ledger accountant can quickly spot those transactions that may be wrong
or placed in the wrong account.

The main problem with incorporating automated error-checking into the
general ledger is that many accounting software packages do not have this feature
built into them. If this is the case, the expense of programming the alterations is
probably so great that it will exceed any possible benefit. In this situation, the
best alternative is to use a report writer to create reports showing problems that
have already been entered into the general ledger. This is a much easier alterna-
tive, since most computer systems have a report writer. In other words, if it is not
possible to stop bad information from entering the general ledger, it may still be
possible to spot it once it is there and subsequently make corrections.

TOTAL IMPACT OF BEST PRACTICES ON THE GENERAL
LEDGER FUNCTION

This section describes how the best practices described earlier in this chapter can
be brought together as a group to achieve a more efficient general ledger function
that also provides better information to management.

The best practices can be clustered into three groups: those that impact the
chart of accounts, those that impact the general ledger, and those that modify the
general ledger to improve the reporting of information. These clusters are shown
in Exhibit 14.2. The first cluster focuses on streamlining the chart of accounts, as
well as various methods for incorporating the charts of accounts of subsidiaries
into those of the parent organization. These best practices focus on improving the
efficiency of the general ledger function. The second cluster uses a number of
techniques not only to improve the ability of the general ledger accountant to
research information in the general ledger (such as with drill-down inquiries or
restricting the use of journal entries), but also to reduce the amount of work
needed to maintain it. In this latter category are such best practices as having sub-
sidiaries load their own financial results into the master general ledger, using
automated error-checking, and automating the interfaces with subsidiary ledgers.

Exhibit 14.2 Impact of Best Practices on the General Ledger Function

these best practices can result in a significant enhancement to the overall effi-
ciency of the general ledger function. Finally, the third cluster of best practices
actually increases the complexity of the general ledger, but does so in order to
provide more information to other parts of the company, either by way of an
activity-based costing analysis or through a data warehouse. Thus, there is a logi-
cal grouping to the best practices that may be useful in designating which clusters
of them are implemented first.


Summary 307

If a controller can designate the order in which all of these best practices are
implemented, it is best to work on streamlining the function first and adding the
data warehousing and ABC functions later. Otherwise, reversing this order of
implementation will result in adding complexity to a situation that is already not
entirely efficient, which may result in a great deal of confusion and a complete
failure to implement any best practices.

For more information on each of the best practices noted in Exhibit 14.2, refer
back to each section in this chapter noted as a separate activity in the flowchart.

SUMMARY

This chapter discussed a variety of best practices for the general ledger function.
Though many of them will reduce the workload of the general ledger accountant
by streamlining the workflow and reducing the number of errors that can enter
into the process, a few can be both difficult and expensive to implement. Some,
such as using the general ledger to support activity-based costing, will even make
the general ledger accountant’s job more difficult, rather than less. Accordingly,
for most general ledger best practices, it is necessary to ensure that there will be
sufficient payback in exchange for installing a new best practice. The payback is
not just greater accounting efficiency, but in a few cases the provision of better
information to the rest of the company.

Internal Auditing
Best Practices

A traditional internal auditing department is frequently considered to be similar
to the external auditors who annually review the corporate financial records,
except that they also deal with operational and control issues and are more fre-
quently found in the field. Since internal auditors are commonly hired from exter-
nal audit firms, it is no surprise that they are likely to bring their old work habits
with them and conduct the reviews just noted. However, as is pointed out many
times in this chapter, the internal auditor’s role can be viewed quite differently,
switching from a systems reviewer to an active partner who can bring tremendous
value to a company’s business units. Thus, many of the best practices noted in
this chapter focus on the revised role of auditors acting as business partners.

Another strong focus in this chapter is on the enhancement of work efficien-
cies within the internal audit department, which tends to suffer from continual
deadline crises, unfinished paperwork, and difficulty determining which audits
need to be addressed first. Examples of recommended changes involve the use of
workflow software to centralize paperwork-related issues, shifting some tasks to
business unit employees, and creating an auditor skills matrix.

This chapter begins with an overview of implementation issues for all of the
internal auditing best practices, followed by a discussion of individual best prac-
tices, each one being presented in a separate section. The chapter finishes with a
review of how these best practices will change a company’s internal auditing
operations.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES FOR INTERNAL AUDITING
BEST PRACTICES

Implementing most of the best practices in this chapter require very little money,
since they largely involve procedural or management changes that are internal to
the department. The cost and installation time required for all the best practices in
this chapter are noted in Exhibit 15.1. However, a number of the best practices
require a modest investment of time, such as performing annual internal control
assessments, creating self-audit guides, and training business unit employees on
training issues. Thus, implementing these best practices will require detailed
management by the internal audit manager to see when auditor time can be made
available to complete the various work items.

310 Internal Auditing Best Practices

The glaring exception to the low-cost rule is the use of workflow software,
which can easily cost well into the six figures and also require a considerable
amount of time to install, which may put it out of reach of most smaller internal
auditing departments.

One best practice is to outsource the internal audit department, though all the
other recommendations in this chapter assume that the department will be
retained. Outsourcing is only useful in those cases where a company does not feel
that internal auditing is a core company function, and where it either can afford
the substantially increased cost of shifting this area to an outside audit firm or
where it conducts so few internal audits that it requires less than one full-time
person to conduct the work.

Consequently, with few exceptions, implementing the best practices in this
chapter can result in significant improvements not only in the usefulness of the inter-
nal audit department, but also in the efficiency with which it conducts its operations.

15-1 ANNUALLY UPDATE AN INTERNAL CONTROL
ASSESSMENT OF EACH BUSINESS UNIT

It is not uncommon for an internal audit department to continually send its auditors
into the field with instructions to review whatever was done in the work papers
from the year before, thereby bringing continual attention to the same risks, year
after year. Though this approach certainly informs those being audited of the
areas requiring strong controls, it does not account for changes in the business
that may require different audit work.

An alternative is to periodically create a formal internal control assessment
document, both for the entire company and for individual business units. This
document points out changes in the business and how they will impact controls,
as well as the status of existing controls and why those controls are needed. This
document can then be sent to the senior management team to promote their
understanding of emerging control issues, as well as to business unit managers,
who will therefore have a greater understanding of which controls are likely to be
subject to review by internal audit teams. Of particular importance to the audit
manager is this document’s usefulness in determining how control reviews must
change from year to year in order to schedule more effective audits.

This document will require a substantial amount of time to prepare and revise,
but the time investment is easily offset by the greater understanding of control issues.

15-2 ISSUE SELF-AUDIT GUIDES TO BUSINESS UNITS

Many of the best practices noted in this chapter involve the conversion of the
internal audit staff from reviewers of controls to advisors who impart knowledge


15-3 Recommend Business Process Improvements to Business Units 311

about business improvements. However, this shift in emphasis means that the tra-
ditional task of reviewing controls will be done much less frequently.

An alternative is to shift some of the controls review burden to the business
units themselves. Though this may seem like a case of having the fox guard the
henhouse, the internal audit department can still monitor business unit results at a
high level to see if general operational and financial performance measures indi-
cate a problem, and then send in a team to conduct a thorough review. In most
cases, there are no serious control breakdowns, so audit tasks with lower-risk pro-
files can be safely assigned to business unit employees. By doing so, there is
greater likelihood of audits being conducted on a regular basis, and by people
who are thoroughly familiar at a detailed level with business processes, which
may result in better audit work.

To make this shift of responsibilities a success, the internal audit department
should construct a series of self-audit guides for the business units. These guides
should briefly explain a control objective, note how specific controls are used
within a process to meet that objective, and then lay out detailed auditing steps
for employees to follow. The level of detail in these guides should be sufficient
for employees without audit training to understand what they are doing and why
it is important. The guides should be short, concise, and targeted only at specific
audit objectives. Also, they must avoid any accounting language that might be
confusing to a nonaccountant. When creating a self-audit guide, be sure to test it
on a nonaccountant to see where points of confusion arise, so that any problems
can be eliminated before the guide is released for general use. Though a great
deal of work is required to create an effective self-audit guide, the effort
expended will be more than offset by the eventual reduction in control review
work by the audit staff.

15-3 RECOMMEND BUSINESS PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS
TO BUSINESS UNITS

The traditional function of the internal auditor has been to diligently root through
a business unit’s processes, looking for control weaknesses or evidence of fraud.
If anything was found, it cast the business unit manager in a poor light. Given this
sequence of events, it should be no surprise that internal auditors are not usually
welcomed by joyous crowds of auditees.

A much better approach is to mix the chore of control reviews with making
suggestions to the business unit managers for process improvements. The internal
auditor is in an ideal position to do this, having an expert knowledge of business
processes, as well as a comparative knowledge of how the same processes are
handled in other parts of the company. Indeed, the internal auditor can be consid-
ered a walking encyclopedia of control process best practices. By shifting to a


312 Internal Auditing Best Practices

focus on valuable improvement recommendations, the internal auditor creates an
entirely different image within the corporation of being a helpful knowledge
worker who can make local managers look like stars. This is a particularly impor-
tant change in focus if the internal auditor can either make additional recommen-
dations in regard to implementation steps for process improvements or bring the
local manager in contact with the in-house expert who has already completed an
implementation. By taking this approach, one can not only be the source of ideas,
but also assist in carrying them out in an indirect manner.

Though control reviews are still necessary to some extent in all organizations,
taking this different view of the position can result in business unit managers begging
the internal audit manager for more staff time to assist them with a variety of tasks.

15-4 TRACK AUDIT RESULTS THROUGH
BUSINESS UNIT SURVEYS WV Author’s Choice

Though auditors must sometimes issue adverse opinions about the state of
process controls at a corporate business unit, this does not lead to long-lasting or
friendly relations with those business units, which has ramifications in terms of
cooperation from the business units when follow-up audits are conducted at a
later date.

Some of these adversarial circumstances can be avoided through the use of
business unit surveys in which the unit managers are given the opportunity to
review audit performance in terms of their perceived relevance, value of recom-
mendations made, accuracy of audit findings, and so on. If a survey results in
excessively poor scores, the internal audit manager can meet with the unit man-
ager to gain clarification about the issues, which may result in steps to improve
auditing goals, processes, or staffing. By continually obtaining survey results and
acting upon them, the internal audit department can align its mission more
closely with that of the business units, resulting in greater value to the business
units. This approach can also be used as an ancillary rating measure for internal
audit staff performance, as well as a method for determining which unit man-
agers need to be dealt with more carefully during upcoming audits.

The results of these surveys should be stored and tracked on a trend line for
several years to gain some idea of the perceived level of performance by the
department. The survey database can also be sorted by audit team, business unit,
and type of audit program conducted, to see if issues continually arise in any of
these three areas that require corrective action.

15-6 Train New Business Unit Managers on Control Issues 313

15-5 TRAIN BUSINESS UNIT STAFF ON
CONTROL ISSUES WV Author’s Choice

Many control problems arise because employees do not understand the impact of
the improper usage of a control. They simply see it as an extra step to be followed
or an inefficiency that can be overcome by altering the process. When internal
auditors spot this type of problem, they usually report it to management, which
must somehow find the time and resources to train the employees in the proper
use of the control. Since this training is not budgeted, it frequently does not
occur, resulting in continuing control problems.

The internal auditor can mitigate this problem by setting aside time at the end
of each audit to personally provide the necessary level of training. This will require
extra time, so some padding must be added to the audit time budget to allow for
employee training. Also, it is most helpful for the internal audit department to have
a set of training guides on major topical areas prepared in advance, and readily
accessible by all auditors for use. These guides should cover processes and controls
in all major areas that are common to multiple business units, such as inventory
transactions, order fulfillment, the purchasing process, and travel expense report-
ing. Though this best practice will require more auditor time than is usually the
case, it helps to reduce the number of control problems that will be found during
subsequent audits, and so saves audit time in the long run. It is also seen as a major
benefit provided by the internal audit staff to the rest of the company.

15-6 TRAIN NEW BUSINESS UNIT MANAGERS ON
CONTROL ISSUES

When new managers are assigned to a business unit, the last thing they want to
see is an internal auditor walking in the door to conduct a review. Their experi-
ence is likely to be the uncovering of some shortfall in the control systems, result-
ing in a black mark against them while they are still struggling to learn the details
of their jobs. In anticipation of this result, a new manager is likely to stonewall an
internal auditor as much as possible in hopes of avoiding any negative findings.
A much more positive approach is for a senior-level internal auditor to meet
with each new manager as part of the initial job training and spend a great deal of
time discussing the control systems over which the manager now has responsibility.
This discussion should include a hands-on review of each process step where
control points are used, as well as conversations about the need for these controls,
how to ensure that they are being followed, and indicators of control failures. The
internal auditor can even point out other possible improvements in the manager’s
systems. By taking this approach, the internal auditor will be seen as a strong


314 Internal Auditing Best Practices

advisor to new managers, and one with whom a long-standing and friendly rela-
tionship can be forged that will assist in the conduct of future audits. This
approach completely contravenes the more adversarial situation that typically
arises between a new manager and an internal auditor.

Cost: SS Installation time:

15-7 AVOID OVER-AUDITING OF INTERNAL AUDITS

Many internal audits involve the repetitive review of the same topical areas, if
only because these areas are perceived to have the highest degree of financial risk
to a company, and so are worthy of constant review. When internal audits are
repeated on a regular basis, the managers of these audits will usually pull out the
work papers from the last audit that was conducted on the same area, and simply
copy out the same auditing requirements. This can result in over-auditing,
because the internal audit manager never questions why each of the tasks needs
to be completed a second time. Many of the audit procedures noted in the work
papers may have been intended to be one-time reviews to investigate perceived
problems that have since been overcome with new control systems, rendering the
original audit steps no longer valid. Given this constant tendency to copy previ-
ous audits, a nonessential audit step may have been repeated dozens of times,
simply on the grounds that if it was done before, it should be done again.

A better approach is to conduct a brief, formal review of the upcoming inter-
nal audit with the internal audit team assigned to do the work. This group should
review the results of the last internal audit, pore over the control chart (if any) for
the area to be reviewed, and come up with a new audit plan for every engage-
ment. By doing so, the team avoids the mindless repetition of early audit steps
that are no longer valid, and concentrates on the key issues that will result in the
most valuable audit results. Also, by including the entire audit team in this
review, a company will find that there is much better buy-in to, and understanding
of, the work being done, which may both increase employee efficiency and
reduce long-term turnover in the internal audit staff.

15-8 COMPLETE ALL INTERNAL AUDIT WORK PAPERS
IN THE FIELD

The objective of an internal audit is to complete a report that describes any control
issues found. However, one would think that, from the perspective of the internal
audit team, the objective would be to move on to the next internal audit as
quickly as possible. There is a preference among internal auditors to continually


15-9 Create a Control Standards Manual 315

meet the upcoming schedule to work on the next audit, rather than to complete
the one currently being conducted. This results in a long trail of incomplete
audits that requires constant badgering by senior management to complete these
audits, frequently requiring weekend work by the internal audit teams. To avoid
this problem, the standard procedure for all internal audits should be that the
work papers be fully completed in the field before an internal audit team is
allowed back to the main office or to proceed to the next audit. Work paper com-
pletion should include the clearing of all points that arose during the audit, as
well as producing the draft report. If this results in delays in the completion of
subsequent internal audits, then fine—it will also yield much more rapid comple-
tion of the final audit reports, which was the objective when the audits were
scheduled. This point can be made to the audit teams more convincingly by issu-
ing even a small bonus for all the internal audits that are wrapped up in the field.

Cost: SS Installation time:

15-9 CREATE A CONTROL STANDARDS MANUAL

Auditors are trained to have a good idea of which control standards should be
attached to a business process. However, the managers who supervise those
processes typically have no idea of which controls are involved. This can result in
inadvertent changes to processes by managers who are simply trying to devise
more efficient systems, which in turn results in adverse findings by auditors when
they conduct reviews.

A reasonable way to avoid this problem is to create a control standards man-
ual for use by process managers. The manual should note the internal control
objectives to be met for each business process, as well as the specific procedures
used to meet those objectives. The manual can also note how different control
points support each other, and what happens when specific controls are removed
from the process. The manual can include flowcharts of the processes, noting
each control point, as well as forms used in the process. Any reports arising from
a process should be noted, describing what information managers should review
that can bolster the control objectives. Clearly, this can be an exceedingly dry
document (except to internal auditors!), so an audit staff person should walk
managers through the manual to highlight its key points. Also, whenever an audit
team arrives for any type of review, they should always bring with them the latest
version of the control standards manual, making a point of highlighting key
changes to it. Only by this constant emphasis on the importance of the manual
will managers take the time to review and understand it.

316 Internal Auditing Best Practices

15-10 CREATE AN ON-LINE INTERNAL AUDIT LIBRARY

An internal audit team will go on most audit engagements without a great deal of
company expertise to back them up. If they encounter an unusual problem in the
field, they have no one to turn to for advice. Similarly, if they encounter a control
problem, they have no way of knowing if it is an isolated issue or if it has been
uncovered in other places within the company. These problems can be reduced by
setting up an on-line internal audit library that contains records from previous com-
pleted audits, as well as who worked on them and how they can be accessed. Fur-
ther, the library can hold updates on all of the most recent accounting standards, as
well as cross-indexed data on problems or unusual audit scenarios encountered dur-
ing other company audits. By accessing this information, audit teams can save a
great deal of research time that would otherwise be spent combing through the
company directory or the paper-based audit files to find the same information.

Setting up such a system requires each internal audit manager to create an
electronic summary-level report on each audit as it is completed, which is then
forwarded to the company webmaster for inclusion in the library. Also (and
involving much more time), staff must be assigned to the same task for all previous
audits for at least the past few years, and preferably for at least the last five (in
order to build up a reasonable base of information). This can be a substantial
effort. Finally, accounting standards can be easily obtained from various CD-
based products for posting on the on-line library. Be sure to obtain an accounting
standards product that contains an index search capability, so that users can easily
search for items of particular interest.

15-11 CREATE AND DISSEMINATE INFORMATION FROM
A BEST PRACTICES DATABASE

A large company will have many internal auditors combing through its processes
in many locations and possibly on multiple continents. These auditors will build a
store of knowledge about best practices that is based only on what they have seen,
and which they will likely recommend to other business units as they travel through-
out the company on various audit projects. Though this will result in the spread of
best practices through a company over time, it is a very inefficient way to do so—
knowledge will only be applicable if an auditor happens to be assigned to another
business unit whose processes could benefit from that person’s specific knowl-
edge, and it will be lost when an internal auditor retires or leaves employment.

A much better way to spread the use of best practices is to store the informa-
tion in a central database. It should be entered into the database as soon as an
audit is completed; it can also be validated in terms of its effectiveness by specif-
ically reviewing its results during a repeat audit at a later date. Auditors can also


15-12 Outsource the Internal Audit Function 317

be given small bonuses or recognition awards for any best practices they uncover
and store in the database, which will have them enthusiastically rooting through
business units to uncover new best practices.

Spreading information about these best practices can take several forms. The
most passive approach is to simply have it available in the database, but this
approach requires auditors to actively review the database in their limited spare
time. A better approach is to actively push the information into the field through
the use of newsletters and e-mails to the audit staff. A particularly effective
approach is to e-mail best practice information directly to those business unit
managers who are most likely to use them; by doing so, the managers are more
likely to contact the internal audit department with requests for assistance in
installing the recommended best practices. The driving force behind the success
of best practices dissemination is the use of someone who regularly reviews the
best practices database for “hot” topics, and who also spends time matching best
practice possibilities with various business units. In a small company, this work
should be done by the internal audit manager, though a larger company may
choose to assign the task to a full-time senior audit position to ensure that the
company gains the most benefit from its best practices database.

Cost: aS Installation time:

15-12 OUTSOURCE THE INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION

Some organizations have their internal audit function report to the controller or
chief financial officer. In these situations, the manager of the accounting function
has the additional burden of selecting auditing targets, planning for audit teams to
review them, managing the teams, and acting on their findings. For a larger orga-
nization, this management work can be a considerable additional burden, for
there may be many auditors.

Though it is not possible to completely eliminate all management of the inter-
nal audit function, a controller or chief financial officer can outsource the function,
which removes selected management tasks. For example, giving all internal audit
work to an outside supplier keeps a manager from having to plan each audit or
review the teams as they conduct their work. It still requires a manager to select
audit targets and act on the results of the audits, but at least some activities have
been eliminated. Using an outside auditor carries with it the additional advantage of
reduced travel time to outlying company locations, since an audit firm with many
locations can assign local staff to each company facility. Further, outside auditors
do not have to be paid if they are not working on company-specific projects, nor
does a company have to pay for their ongoing training. These advantages have
pushed a number of companies into the arms of outside auditors.

However, there are problems with this best practice that have raised some ire
in the ranks of internal auditors. One issue is that many companies use their inter-


318 Internal Auditing Best Practices

nal auditing departments to groom new managers for senior-level positions. This
is an excellent approach, for not only does it give auditors a wide-ranging view of
company operations, but it also allows the managers of functions being audited to
see them and to provide feedback to the human resources department regarding
the wisdom of promoting them to more senior positions. Another problem is that
outside auditors will sometimes assign junior staff personnel to internal audits,
which allows them to charge less per hour. However, these junior personnel fre-
quently have less experience than the internal auditors, and no experience with
specific details of company operations, making them doubly inefficient. Conse-
quently, one must carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of this
approach before handing over the internal audit department to a supplier.

15-13 SCHEDULE SOME INTERNAL AUDITS
ON A JUST-IN-TIME BASIS VW Author’s Choice

A very common management practice is to create a schedule of all internal audits
to be performed for the upcoming year. This allows the audit manager to arrange
for meetings with local managers well in advance, as well as to determine the
logistics of shifting auditors around the world to various company locations. It is
also a common measurement tool, whereby the audit manager commits to com-
pleting a certain number of audits; subsequently, finishing all work listed on the
annual schedule is used as the baseline measure of success. Unfortunately, block-
ing out the entire audit staff’s time for a year in advance also leaves no room for
audits that are requested on short notice, which typically arises when an emer-
gency with control issues arises. Addressing these needs calls for a substantial
reshuffling of the audit schedule.

A fine alternative is to schedule only a portion of the internal audit team’s time,
perhaps two-thirds, leaving the remaining time slots open. By doing so, any short-
term work requests can be dealt with promptly. Not only does this give company
managers the impression that the internal audit department is more responsive to
their needs, but it also eliminates the need for sudden schedule changes. The only
problem with this approach is that one can no longer determine the success of the
internal audit department based on its ability to complete a planned set of audits.

15-14 SCHEDULE INTERNAL AUDITS BASED ON RISK

The scheduling of various areas within a company for internal audits is usually an
arcane process, involving pressure from the audit committee to have a few “pet”


15-15 Use Workflow Software for Internal Audits 319

areas investigated; during the process some department managers demand
reviews of other areas, while others put forth considerable effort to avoid them,
on the grounds that they take up too much staff time. The internal audit manager
is caught in the midst of this maelstrom, trying to please everyone while still
scheduling audits for those areas in which he or she has a feeling that some prob-
lems may lurk. A simple way to revise this scheduling process is to base all audits
on the concept of risk to the company.

To schedule based on risk, a company must devise a ranking for risk levels,
with number one being any potential control problem that could place the com-
pany in grave financial danger, while lower levels of risk can be assigned a lesser
category. Then the internal audit manager can assign a risk ranking to each
requested audit, while also conducting a review of other control areas to see if
there are other areas of risk that are not currently being addressed. The upshot of
this process is a clear ranking of audit reviews that is highly defensible and that
will focus the bulk of company audit attention on those few key control processes
that are at the most risk of causing financial trouble.

The main issue to be aware of is that the internal audit committee should for-
mally approve of this scheduling process, so that the internal audit manager can
use that committee’s support when telling other company managers that their
requested audits will not occur quite so quickly as they would like.

15-15 USE WORKFLOW SOFTWARE FOR INTERNAL AUDITS

Larger companies with many internal auditors face the following challenge: They
have a difficult time controlling the activities of their auditors, rarely have a good
knowledge of prior audits already completed, require extra travel time to return to
company locations to clear hanging audit issues, and cannot readily see if the
same auditing problems are cropping up in multiple parts of the company. These
problems result in significant inefficiencies in work efforts.

One can resolve these problems by installing workflow software that has
been tailored to the particular needs of the internal auditing environment. For
example, workflow software contains forms and templates that are commonly
used in most audits, allowing the staff to save time that would otherwise be spent
creating work papers from scratch. In addition, information entered directly into
the workflow database through these on-line forms can be reviewed from a cen-
tral location by audit managers, thereby reducing the amount of time spent travel-
ing to remote company locations. Further, this information is then available to all
auditors, anywhere in the company, for immediate review.

If audit documents must be approved by multiple people, the software can
send an electronic version of the documents to each person in turn, and wait for
each one’s approval before being sent to the next person in the approval process.


320 Internal Auditing Best Practices

It can also inform each approver of the date by which approval must be obtained.
The system can also keep track of when each document was made, by whom, and
when it was subsequently reviewed and approved. Reviewers can also create
review notes that are attached to the electronic audit documents and that must be
cleared by the audit team before the work papers will receive final approval.

Workflow software can also maintain a database of previous audit work at each
company location, as well as the results of that work, so that subsequent audit teams
can review the prior work to see what efforts can be avoided in the future. Of partic-
ular importance is a risk assessment by prior audit teams, so one can immediately
see where the bulk of new audit work should be directed. The system can also be

15-16 ADD SPECIALISTS TO AUDIT TEAMS

A typical internal auditor has received training in a standard set of auditing func-
tions that apply to the activities encountered in the majority of audits. However,
specialized processes will be scheduled for audits from time to time for which the
internal audit staff has received no training. This may arise when a business
process has been specially modified or enhanced at one or a few company loca-
tions, and the internal audit staff is unfamiliar with the modifications or their
impact on controls. These audits can be difficult, since the internal auditor must
spend time learning the new or revised process and determining any resulting
changes to the control environment.

A better approach is to invite specialists to an audit to deal with these
processes. A good person to invite is someone who has personally been involved in
the implementation of a particular system at a different location, and who, there-
fore, is an expert on the process under review. This person is particularly useful if
the intent of the audit is to recommend the implementation of the system in which
the person is an expert, since he or she can offer valuable implementation tips to the
local management team in regard to installing the system. Once the audit is over,
the audit team disbands, with the specialist returning to his or her business unit.
This person may be used again at a later date, or the internal auditors can learn
enough from the specialist to take that person’s place on subsequent audits.

15-18 Assign Internal Auditors to System Development Teams 321

15-17 ASSIGN AN AUDITOR TO BE A RELATIONSHIP MANAGER
WITH EACH BUSINESS UNIT

The internal audit department rarely has visibility into the work of individual
business units. The unit managers typically revise their own systems on an ongo-
ing basis in order to streamline processes, and never think to check with the inter-
nal audit staff for advice on these changes. Also, the internal audit department has
access to a wealth of information about how other business units structure their
processes, but rarely has an opportunity to relay this information to business unit
managers, resulting in many lost opportunities for improvements.

Both of these issues can be avoided by assigning a senior internal auditor to
the role of relationship manager with the manager of each business unit. This per-
son is responsible for communicating regularly with an assigned manager, not
only to impart improvement information but also to find out which activities at
the business unit should involve the participation of the internal audit staff. For
example, if a business unit is considering programming a new accounts payable
system, the relationship manager can ask that an auditor be assigned to the design
team to ensure that appropriate controls are built into the system. This approach
is also an excellent means for improving relations between the internal audit
department and the rest of the company.

15-18 ASSIGN INTERNAL AUDITORS TO SYSTEM
DEVELOPMENT TEAMS

When a company’s software development staff creates a new business system,
either the accounting staff or the external auditors find control problems after the
fact that require either significant programming changes or major modifications to
other systems that must now be relied upon as secondary controls that offset the
problems found. Some of these problems are so severe that entire systems must be
scrapped or entirely reworked. The worst case is when a control weakness is spot-
ted by someone who exploits it to fraudulently part a company from its assets.

Many of these control problems can be eliminated by making an internal
audit person an integral part of a systems design team. By regularly reviewing the
conceptual and detailed designs of new systems, internal auditors can spot poten-
tial control problems before any significant programming time has been spent on
them. This not only achieves a higher level of control in new systems, but also
avoids the time that would otherwise be spent on correctional changes to systems
at a later date. Proper use of this best practice requires the involvement of audi-
tors with significant systems design and controls knowledge.

15-19 CREATE AN AUDITOR SKILLS MATRIX

Not all auditors are created equal. Some have a considerable degree of training in
specific types of computer systems, others have great operational experience,
while still others come from the more classical “school” of external audit firms;
furthermore, some have garnered experience with particular types of business units
or processes over the years. Unfortunately, these differing skill bases are some-
times ignored when assigning auditors to specific audits, resulting in mismatches
of skills and required work. This in turn can result in incomplete audits or ones
whose results are not sufficiently specific, detailed, or helpful to the recipient.

This problem can be eliminated through the creation of an auditor skills
matrix. In its simplest form, this is just a collection of auditor resumes that is reg-
ularly updated after each audit. However, such a collection is not easily searched
for specific skill types, and so is only useful when there are very few internal
auditors on staff. A much better approach is itemize these skills in a database that
is easily searched based on key words. This allows an audit manager to punch the
key requirements of an upcoming audit into the database and instantly receive
back a list of those auditors most qualified to complete the work. The key issue
with a skills database is that it requires constant updating, since auditor skills are
constantly improving through training and new audits. Consequently, someone
must be assigned the task of updating skills information on a regular basis,
preferably after the completion of each audit and after auditors have completed
scheduled tasks. If this updating chore is assigned to the auditors themselves,
then their annual reviews should include a discussion of the updates they have
loaded into the database, thereby highlighting the importance of this task.

TOTAL IMPACT OF BEST PRACTICES ON THE
INTERNAL AUDITING FUNCTION

Many of the best practices discussed in this chapter are noted in Exhibit 15.2,
where best practices are clustered into those occurring prior to the commence-
ment of an audit and those occurring during or after it. Best practices related to
staffing, workflow management, or audit staffing are not included.

In the exhibit, it is evident that a considerable amount of work can be com-
pleted in advance, to determine the need for control assessments, as well as to
provide audit teams with as much information as possible about their prospective
audits. A great many changes are advocated during the audit, such as giving con-
trols and self-audit training to the staff and managers of business units, and issu-
ing process improvement recommendations to unit managers. Subsequent to the
audit, the tracking of audit survey results can be used to revise the planning and
staffing for future audits.

324 Internal Auditing Best Practices

SUMMARY

The primary intent of this chapter was to recommend a shift in focus for the inter-
nal audit department, from a detailed reviewer of business processes to an enabler
of process improvements. This change requires a significant attitudinal adjustment
by the internal audit manager, who is probably wedded to the traditional concept of
independent control reviews that tend to create adversarial or, at least, cool relations
with company managers. If the recommendations made here seem to be too much of
a stretch for the internal audit manager, then try just one best practice — the business
unit survey —which may reveal that the rest of the company gives a lower value to
the internal audit department than its manager supposes, and which may then spark
further changes.


Chapter 16

 

Inventory Best Practices

This chapter describes a variety of best practices that are tightly focused on
improving the accuracy of the existing inventory, as well as on all ongoing inven-
tory transactions. Though these improvements most directly assist other depart-
ments, such as the production, warehouse, and purchasing employees, the
accounting staff is deeply interested as well. The reason is that the accuracy of
the financial statements is largely driven by the accuracy of the inventory —if it is
off by even a few percent, the variance flows through the cost of goods sold,
resulting in a considerable amount of inaccuracy in reported profits.

The best practices shown in this chapter are different from those listed else-
where in this book, in that the controller must obtain the approval and active partic-
ipation of the warehouse and engineering managers for most of them. Without their
help, such best practices as improving the bills of material, moving inventory to
floor stock, and segregating customer-owned inventory will not be accomplished.

The remainder of this chapter consists of a review of implementation issues
for inventory best practices, followed by a detailed discussion of each one, and
ending with notes on the impact of best practices on the inventory function.

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES FOR INVENTORY BEST PRACTICES

This section describes the levels of implementation difficulty for each of the best
practices detailed in this chapter. Each one is noted in Exhibit 16.1, alongside a list-
ing of the relative level of implementation cost and duration. Most of these best
practices are not simple ones to install because they involve one or more other
departments, usually warehousing and engineering. Whenever another manager is
brought into the implementation process, the chances of success drop rapidly, since
this additional person must be convinced of the efficacy of the change.

A few of the best practices noted here rarely succeed at all, though world-class
companies have installed them—these are the elimination of the warehouse and the
receiving function, which can only be accomplished through a time-consuming
process of inventory elimination and supplier qualification. However, for those com-
panies that are well along in accomplishing these tasks, the best practices should be
considered, given the resulting reduction in costs and elimination of inventories.

Most of the other best practices are relatively inexpensive to install, since they
generally involve changes to procedures, which have no attendant expense at all.

16-1 AUDIT BILLS OF MATERIAL V Author's Choice

Some companies use back-flushing as the means of recording changes to inventory.
Under this methodology, inventory is taken from the warehouse without any associ-
ated picking transactions put into the computer. Then, when production is com-
pleted, the total amount of production by item is entered into the computer, and the
software automatically removes the associated inventory amounts from the ware-
house records, using bills of material as the basis for doing so. Though this is a very
simple method for keeping warehouse paperwork to a minimum, an incorrect bill
of material will quickly alter the on-hand inventory balances to such an extent that
inventory accuracy will plummet. In addition, the accounting department uses the
bills of material to determine the cost of any finished goods; an inaccurate bill will
also impact the accuracy of this costing. Thus, the accuracy of a company’s bills of
material impact not only the records for inventory quantities, but also their cost.

The best practice that keeps the bills of material errors to a minimum is an
ongoing audit of them. This practice keeps inventory quantities from becoming
too inaccurate in a back-flushing environment, while making the costing of fin-
ished goods more precise. To do so, a person who is knowledgeable about the
contents of bills of material must be assigned to a regular review of them. Any
problems must be corrected at once. To be the most effective, it is best to concen-
trate the efforts of the reviewer on those bills that are used the most or that are
expected to be included in upcoming production runs. By focusing on those bills
receiving the most usage, a company can be sure of maintaining a high degree of
bill accuracy for the bulk of its products.

The only difficulty in implementing this approach is that it requires the coop-
eration of the engineering manager, who must assign a staff person to the review-
ing process. This assistance is critical, since engineers are the ones with the best
knowledge of bills of material.

16-2 MODIFY THE BILLS OF MATERIAL BASED ON
ACTUAL SCRAP LEVELS

The typical company relies heavily on its bills of material to determine the cost of
its products. They can be used not only as a reference tool to quickly look up a
cost, but also as the primary means of calculating the remaining on-hand inven-
tory balance if back-flushing is used. Under the back-flushing concept, a com-
pany simply enters the amount of its production for the day, and the computer
will automatically clear this inventory from stock, based on the amount of materials
that should have been used, as noted in the bills of material. Though this
approach is remarkably easy to use, given the reduced volume of paperwork, it
can quickly lead to very inaccurate inventory balances if the underlying bills of


328 Inventory Best Practices

material are incorrect. This is a particularly difficult problem if the true scrap
level is not reflected in the bills of material. If this is the case, the amount of
materials listed in each bill will be too small, resulting in an inadequate amount
being back-flushed out of inventory, which leaves inventory balances too high.

The best practice that resolves this situation is to ensure that the correct scrap
levels are included in each bill of material. By doing so, the amount of material
back-flushed out of the inventory will be much more accurate, resulting in a more
accurate inventory, cost of goods sold, and fewer (if any) material stock-outs to
interfere with production.

To add accurate scrap rates to the bills of material, there must be a scrap
reporting system already in place that notes the precise quantities of scrap that
occur whenever a product is produced. With this information in hand, one can eas-
ily update scrap rates with a great deal of precision. Also, access to the information
in the bills of material must be severely restricted to ensure that no one but an
authorized user is allowed to change the scrap rates in bills; without this security
point, there is no way to ensure that the most accurate scrap rates are indeed in the
computer system. In addition, there must be constant attention to the scrap rates,
for they will change over time as production practices and machinery change.
Without this continual review process, the existing scrap rates in the bills of mate-
rial will gradually depart from actual rates. Finally, there should be a provision in
the computer system for automatically changing large blocks of scrap rates in
many bills of material; given the time needed to alter individual scrap line items in
all existing bills, this is an extremely helpful labor-saving device to have on hand.
If all of these issues are addressed, the accuracy of the bills of material should rise
markedly, along with the accuracy of the inventory and cost of goods sold.

16-3 REVIEW INVENTORY RETURNED TO THE WAREHOUSE

Most organizations that produce any sort of tangible product will be familiar with
this scenario: the warehouse staff uses a computer-generated picking list to pick a
number of items from the shelf for use in an upcoming manufacturing order,
delivers these items to the production facility, and then finds after the job is com-
pleted that a number of items are returned to the warehouse, even though the pick
list it used was intended to completely use up all items picked. Any returns of this
type indicate that the bills of material used to compile the pick lists are incorrect.
When this happens, the bills of material are listing too high a quantity of materials;
if these bills are also used to calculate the amount of items to be purchased, this
results in an excessive number of purchases being made. From an accounting per-
spective, an inaccurate bill of material leads to inaccurate product costs, which
results in an inaccurate finished goods valuation.

The best way to avoid this issue is to create a procedure for closely examin-
ing the parts returned to the warehouse, in order to determine exactly which line


16-4 Compare Open Purchase Orders to Current Requirements 329

items in the bills of material are inaccurate. This may require the assistance of the
engineer who is responsible for each bill of material, since this person has the
most knowledge of what is supposed to be contained in each product. By making
changes to the bills, one can improve the accuracy of purchases, eliminate the
labor of the warehouse staff in logging parts back into the warehouse, and be
assured of accurate finished goods costs.

The only problem with installing this procedure is that it requires the active
cooperation of the warehouse manager, who will most likely try to avoid the has-
sle of investigating product returns and just put items back on the shelf with no
further investigation. However, explaining that a proper amount of up-front inves-
tigation will lead to a smaller number of part returns in the future may sway this
person to be of more assistance.

This best practice can also be used in reverse, so that any additional parts
issuances to the production floor are investigated. In this situation, the quantities
listed on the bills of material are too low, resulting in parts shortages that will
probably lead to incomplete production runs, on the grounds that the production
staff runs out of parts before completing the scheduled quantity of products.

Cost: SS Installation time:

16-4 COMPARE OPEN PURCHASE ORDERS
TO CURRENT REQUIREMENTS

Between the time when a company issues a purchase order to a supplier and the date
when the ordered items arrive, several problems may arise that render the original
purchase order inaccurate. First, customer orders to the company may change,
resulting in a modified production schedule that no longer requires certain parts
from suppliers. Second, ongoing changes in the design of company products may
render certain parts obsolete. Third, adjustments to recorded inventory balances
through the cycle-counting process may result in a need for fewer or more parts than
are currently on order. For these reasons, by the date of their arrival, the amount of
goods delivered by suppliers may vary significantly from a company’s needs.

To alleviate this problem, one can design a report that should be run through
the corporate materials planning system on a daily basis, comparing the amount
of outstanding balances on open purchase orders to the company’s needs, as
listed in the material requirements portion of the company computer systems. A
daily review of this report by the purchasing staff allows them to modify the
amounts listed on open purchase orders, thereby resulting in an ongoing reduc-
tion in the amount of inventory kept on hand. This report is a standard part of any
material requirements planning system, but must be created as a custom report
for those companies without such a system.

16-5 ELIMINATE THE RECEIVING FUNCTION

Similar to section 16-10, the receiving function is responsible for entering
receipts into the computer system, and occasionally does not do a good job in this
capacity. For example, the late or inaccurate data entry of receiving information
can lead to inaccurate financial statements, as well as inaccurate information for
the production planning and purchasing staffs to procure and assemble materials
for the production department to use.

As was also the case in section 16-10, the solution is to eliminate the
function. And, as was the case before, this is an extremely difficult best prac-
tice to implement. The concept that only a relatively small number of compa-
nies have fully implemented is to fully qualify suppliers in terms of their ability
to ship goods of high quality, precisely on time, and to do so directly to the
production process. This requires a great deal of advance work by the purchasing
staff to find suppliers that are willing to do this, as well as supplier inspections
to company engineers to ensure that supplier quality standards match or exceed
those of the company. Only after this work has been done can a company convert
to the direct delivery of goods to the production department, bypassing the
receiving area.

A final problem to overcome is how to account for receipts if there is no
receiving staff. The answer is to assume that parts were received if the products in
which they are used as components were built. Accordingly, production records
are exploded into their component parts in the computer to determine whose parts
were used, and to then pay those suppliers based on these usage records. Sub-
sidiary problems to resolve before this payment system will work are to central-
ize component sourcing with one supplier per part and to eliminate all scrap from
the production process. Supplier centralization is necessary because the computer
system will not know which supplier to pay once it backs into the number of parts
used. Similarly, there can be no scrap in the production process, or else suppliers
will not be paid for the full number of parts delivered, since these parts were not
included in finished products; the only alternative that will work here is to set up
a scrap reporting system, from which suppliers can also be paid.

Clearly, there are a large number of major issues to overcome before the
receiving department can be eliminated. Though this does result in fewer transac-
tion errors for the accounting department to worry about, this improvement is
dwarfed by the changes needed to bring it about. Accordingly, this best practice
should only be attempted if there are a number of other reasons, probably involv-
ing other departments, for eliminating the receiving function.

16-7 Shift Raw Materials Ownership to Suppliers 331

16-6 ELIMINATE THE WAREHOUSE

The source of many accounting-related transactions is the warehouse. This depart-
ment records entries for the receipt, movement, and issuance of parts to and from
stock. If any of these transactions are incorrect, the inventory quantities used to
derive the cost of goods sold, as well as of on-hand inventory, will be incorrect. In
addition, there is probably a fair amount of obsolete inventory somewhere in the
warehouse, which the accounting staff must identify and cost out. These are major
issues that can seriously impact the accuracy of the financial statements.

A very difficult best practice to implement is the complete elimination of the
inventory, which in turns means the elimination of the warehouse. Several world-
class companies have achieved this best practice by switching to just-in-time
receiving and production, which allows them to bypass the storage of all parts in
a warehouse. By doing so, a company can avoid all of the transactions needed to
log something in and out of the warehouse, not to mention avoiding all the
staffing, space, insurance, and inventory obsolescence and damage costs that go
along with having a warehouse. From the perspective of the accounting staff, this
is the ultimate best practice in inventory accounting, since there is no inventory to
account for besides the relatively minor amounts in work-in-process.

Unfortunately, this is a goal that very few companies achieve, for a variety
of reasons. First, just-in-time receiving and production are very difficult con-
cepts to fully implement, given the difficulty of changing both internal
processes and the delivery systems of suppliers. Further, there may be some
parts that are shipped from long distances or that are difficult to obtain, and that
must be kept in some sort of warehousing facility. Finally, the existing amount
of inventory may take years to reduce to zero, unless a company is willing to
take write-downs to eliminate some stock or return it to suppliers at a loss.
Nonetheless, if a company can convert even some of its systems to just-in-time,
it is possible to send received parts directly to the production facility without
spending any time in the warehouse; this reduces the number of inventory
transactions that can be made in error, resulting in an overall increase in the
level of accounting accuracy.

16-7 SHIFT RAW MATERIALS OWNERSHIP TO SUPPLIERS

The raw materials portion of a company’s inventory can consume a major part of
its working capital investment, money that could otherwise be used for other
activities. Also, the occasional purchase of excessive quantities of stock will
eventually result in a large proportion of the inventory being obsolete. Manufac-
turing companies will find that these are particularly large problems that have a
major impact not only on cash flow but also on profits.


332 Inventory Best Practices

One way to mitigate the adverse effect of raw materials inventory is to shift its
ownership to suppliers. Under this scenario, suppliers deliver goods to the com-
pany in whatever quantities they want, above a designated minimum, as long as
they do not exceed the physical storage area set aside for their use. The company
logs these items out of the storage area when it uses them and pays the supplier
for the amounts used. This has the obvious impact of eliminating a company’s
investment in raw materials, and shifts the burden of obsolescence to the supplier.
In exchange, the supplier obtains a single-source contract with the company,
ensuring itself of sales for at least one year and possibly for several, and using a
pricing schedule that both parties have agreed to in advance. In addition, the sup-
plier can park extra inventory at the customer location, thereby avoiding the cost
of any just-in-time deliveries.

Unfortunately, there are several problems with this best practice that limit its
practical application. First, it is generally limited to nearby suppliers that can reg-
ularly monitor stocking levels at the company location. Second, the company
must be willing to share its material requirements information with suppliers.
Third, the company must be willing to sole source large portions of its inventory.
Fourth, any custom parts made or obtained by the supplier will ultimately be paid
for by the company, even if it never uses them, since the supplier has no other
means for liquidating the stock. Fifth, the company must be responsible for any
inventory discrepancies, since these problems typically arise through the lack of
knowledge of inventory-tracking procedures by its own staff. Within these
restrictions, many companies with large raw material inventories will find that the
prospective elimination of at least some of their investment in inventory is well
worth the effort.

16-8 AUDIT ALL INVENTORY TRANSACTIONS

For any manufacturing organization, there are myriad transactions associated
with the receipt of goods, their transfer to locations in the warehouse, and addi-
tional movement to the production floor, as well as the return of any excess items
to the warehouse. Given the inordinate volume of transactions, some are bound to
be done incorrectly. When this happens, the recorded quantities of inventory on
hand and used will be incorrect, resulting in incorrect financial results. The prob-
lem impacts other departments too, since inaccurate inventory volumes impact
the purchasing, production, and warehouse departments.

One best practice that targets inventory transaction problems is auditing
them. By doing so, one can spot problems, research why they happened, and take
actions to keep the transaction errors from occurring again. For example, if an
audit uncovers a lack of operator training that results in receiving not being com-


16-9 Compare Recorded Inventory Activity to On-Hand Inventories 333

pleted in the computer, either a comprehensive or focused training session with
that person, along with follow-up reviews, will eliminate the error.

Auditing can be assigned to the internal audit department. However, continual
review work may be necessary, which the audit department may not have suffi-
cient manpower to provide; the accounting department is well advised to take on
this chore itself, if no other approach will work. Once the entity doing the work
has been determined, the next step is to find the best way to spot transaction prob-
lems among the hundreds or thousands of inventory-related transactions that occur
every month. A simple random selection of transactions will eventually discover a
reasonable quantity of mistakes to review, but there are ways to improve one’s
chances of finding them. For example, a transaction that results in a negative
inventory on-hand quantity is certainly worthy of a review, as is any transaction
that takes more out of stock than is actually there. The same exception rules can be
applied to transactions with inordinately large quantities. Further, transactions can
be compared to the production schedule to see if any of the items received in the
warehouse are scheduled to be used in production in the near future. Any of these
issues are indicative of a problem and should be reviewed first. Though many of
them may be valid, the odds of finding an error are greatly enhanced.

The next step in the auditing process is discovering the nature of the problem
that caused the transaction error. Since the only two possibilities are systems or
people problems, it is wise to assign a team with exceptional systems knowledge
and people skills to this task. Since most employees will not admit to an error if
they have made one, the single most important auditing skill is carefully dealing in
a nonthreatening manner with the people involved in these transactions. Finally,
there must be a follow-up routine established that reviews previously uncovered
problems to verify that they have been fixed. Only if all of these steps are followed
will errors in the recording of inventory-related transactions be fixed.

As several departments are involved in the recording of transactions related
to inventory, the controller must be able to deal carefully with the managers of
these other departments to ensure that the auditing process does not degrade into
a situation where discovered problems are used to attack each other. Thus, inter-
personal skills are critical to the success of this best practice.

16-9 COMPARE RECORDED INVENTORY
ACTIVITY TO ON-HAND INVENTORIES V Author’s Choice

Some industries deal with extremely expensive materials. In these situations, it is
critical to ensure that recorded inventory levels are completely accurate, since
even a small quantity variance can lead to a large impact on profitability. This is a
particular concern when dealing with precious metals or gemstones, not to men-
tion a variety of electronic components.


334 Inventory Best Practices

Many of the other best practices noted in this chapter will help to keep inven-
tory accuracy within reasonable limits, such as auditing inventory transactions or
cycle counting; but to be absolutely sure that quantities are correct, the best way
is to compare recorded inventory activity to on-hand inventories. This approach
varies from auditing because it assumes a 100 percent review of all transactions
for selected items. Because it is a highly labor-intensive approach, one must con-
fine it to a minimum number of especially expensive or critical inventory items.

To use this method, one should conduct a daily comparison of on-hand quan-
tities to every transaction associated with them, such as receipts, inventory
moves, scrap, production, returns from the production floor, and shipments. Of
particular interest during this review process is any transaction that is not made,
is made twice, is made in the wrong amount or on the wrong date, or involves the
wrong part number or unit of measure. Only by conducting this complete review
every day can a company determine where there are problems in the stream of
transactions and fix them immediately. One should also try to spot trends in or
concentrations of transaction errors, such as a number of receiving or scrap
errors, which allows one to target a specific problem and fix it.

This best practice is strongly supported by those other departments that rely
on accurate inventory levels, such as the warehousing, production, and purchas-
ing departments. However, they support this because they do not have to provide
the significant amount of staff time required to ensure its success. Accordingly, a
controller should be extremely careful to use it only with a very small minority of
the inventory items, monitor it carefully, and eliminate items from the review
process as soon as it becomes apparent that there are no transactional errors
occurring.

16-10 ELIMINATE THE PHYSICAL COUNT PROCESS

As noted in the last section, there are a variety of problems associated with hav-
ing any sort of physical count at all. This section outlines how to use cycle-counts
to completely avoid any physical count.

One must use cycle-counting as the primary way to eliminate the physical
counting process. To do so, there are a set of carefully defined steps to follow
before inventory reaches an accuracy level sufficiently high to allow one to avoid
the physical count. One should read through all of the following steps and make a
realistic assessment of a company’s ability not only to complete them, but also to
maintain the system over a long period. If it is not realistically possible, then do
not run the risk of wasting up to a year of work on this project—there are other
best practices in this chapter that pose a much higher chance of success. The
steps are as follows:


16-10 Eliminate the Physical Count Process 335

1. Throw out the trash. The warehouse must first be cleaned up before spending
a great deal of time on counting parts. Accordingly, trash, obsolete parts, and
old supplies or tools must either be thrown out or moved to an outlying loca-
tion.

2. Identify the remainder. The first step reduces the amount of inventory items
to be reviewed for part numbers. This is now the main task—review all
remaining inventory and post a part number on it.

3. Consolidate inventory. Once all parts are identified, it is time to cluster them
together for easy counting, rather than leaving them in a variety of locations.
This takes several iterations before all inventory is completely consolidated,
but do not worry about it—the main reason for consolidating at this stage is
to make it easier to count and box the inventory in the next step, so a few
unconsolidated items will not present much of a problem later on.

4. Count and box the remainder. Count all the inventory and then box or bag it.
There should be a seal on each container, with the quantity marked on the seal,
so that a glance at the container will reveal the complete quantity of the part.
This is of vast benefit to cycle-counters, who can now cycle-count hundreds of
items very quickly. Please note that it is not necessary at this point to correct all
inventory balances in the computer, for the cycle-counters will soon take care
of this problem when they start to methodically review the entire warehouse.

5. Create warehouse locations. Clearly mark every bin location. The location
should include the aisle, rack, and bin number, so there is no question about
where an inventory item is located. This step is crucial for cycle-counting,
since one cannot cycle-count if one cannot first find the part.

6. Assign inventory to specific locations. Go into the computer and assign a
location code to every inventory item. This may require special program-
ming to put a location field into the computer database.

7. Create a cycle-counting report. Create a computer report that lists all on-
hand inventory, sorted by location code. The cycle-counters must have this
available as their main tool for reviewing inventory.

8. Segregate the warehouse. Put up a fence around the warehouse and lock the
gate! Now that cycle-counting is about to begin, there should be no way for
nonwarehouse staff to enter the warehouse in order to take parts off the shelf.

9. Initiate cycle-counts. Assign cycle-counters a section of the warehouse to
count. Issue them the latest cycle-counting report. They must carefully count
all the items in every bin location and make corrections to the report to
ensure that the computer database is correct. The warehouse manager should
monitor their progress every day to ensure that they are completing their
counts on time. A good initial cycle-counting frequency is to review the
entire inventory six times a year; this high volume of counting can drop later,
when accuracy levels increase.


336 Inventory Best Practices

10. Audit inventory accuracy. Audit the inventory once a week. A small sample
of the total inventory is sufficient to determine the total accuracy of the
inventory, which should be posted for the review of the warehouse staff. It
may be necessary to post accuracy by aisle, in case some sections of the
warehouse are particularly prone to mistakes. If so, the best cycle-counters
should be assigned to these aisles.

11. Use a bonus program. The entire warehouse staff should receive a bonus at
the end of each month, based on the audited accuracy of the inventory. A
good measure above which bonuses should be given is 95 percent accuracy,
with any item being defined as accurate if the counted quantity is within 2
percent of the amount listed in the computer (though this may not be a good
measure in some industries, such as diamond processing). This is an
extremely effective way to maintain the interest of the warehouse staff in the
continuing accuracy of the inventory records.

Though cycle-counting will certainly allow one to avoid a physical inventory
count, it is equally important to investigate why errors are occurring, not just to
change inventory balances if they are wrong. If one can get to the bottom of a trans-
action problem and fix the underlying error, it is possible to greatly increase record
accuracy and require less work by the cycle-counting staff to keep it that way.

16-11 LOCK DOWN THE WAREHOUSE AREA V Author’s Choice

The single most important cause of inventory inaccuracy is parts “‘walking out
of the warehouse.” This means that the physical layout of the warehouse allows
anyone to wander in and take any parts they need for the production process.
When this happens, there is no record that any item was taken from stock, so no
one knows what is left on the shelf, or even if there is anything left, which ren-
ders any automated reordering system useless. From the accountant’s perspec-
tive, the physical inventory count will probably be significantly different from
what the accounting records show, resulting in a large inventory variance at the
end of the year.

All of these problems can be eliminated by segregating the warehouse. This
is done by setting up a fence around the entire storage area and locking the gate
when there are no warehouse personnel on hand. In addition, there must be iron-
clad rules about who has a key to this gate. If too many keys are handed out, any-
one will still be able to enter the warehouse after hours. To prevent this, there
should be no more than one key given to the production personnel, and then only
to the most responsible person, who will faithfully mark down anything taken
from the warehouse. If possible, even this should be avoided by prepositioning
any needed parts outside of the warehouse for use by the production staff when


16-12 Move Inventory to Floor Stock 337

the warehouse staff is not available. Further, the warehouse staff must be care-
fully instructed as to why no one but them is allowed in the warehouse; further,
they should receive additional training in how to process inventory transactions,
and then be given a bonus plan based on reaching high inventory accuracy levels.
Only by taking all of these steps will there be a good chance that nonwarehouse
personnel can be kept out of the warehouse and that the warehouse personnel are
committed to a high level of inventory accuracy.

This best practice is always opposed by the production department, which
claims that either it will be too time-consuming to wait for the warehouse depart-
ment to pick parts from the shelf or that they will not be able to get any parts at
all if the warehouse staff is not available. The best way to allay these fears is to
have all systems in place and fully functional before locking down the ware-
house. By doing so, the production staff will find that there are no problems with
the new system and will have no complaints left to make.

16-12 MOVE INVENTORY TO FLOOR STOCK WV Author’s Choice

The typical inventory contains an enormous number of small parts, many of which
are difficult to track, are not stored in easily countable containers, and require a
large amount of paperwork in proportion to their size and frequency of usage. In
short, they are a pain for the warehouse staff to handle. Likewise, they represent a
minor irritation for the accounting staff, since they must all be counted during the
physical inventory counting process, and, because of the difficulty of counting
them, they take up an inordinate amount of time. Further, they can easily represent
one-third of the total number of inventory items, which is one-third more costing
documentation than the accounting staff wants to track. Accordingly, it is safe to
say that the smallest and most inexpensive parts in inventory are the root cause of a
great deal of extra work for the employees of several departments.

A moderately easy best practice that takes care of this problem is shifting the
small inventory items out of the warehouse and onto the shop floor, where they
are treated as supplies. This approach carries the multiple benefits of requiring far
less inventory handling work from the warehouse staff, fewer inventory counts
during the physical inventory process, and much less inventory-costing work
from the accounting staff. In addition, it brings more inventory close to the shop
floor, where the production staff appreciates the readier access, as well as not
having to go to the parts counter to requisition additional parts. This is one of the
rare best practices that is greeted with universal approval by a multitude of per-
sonnel, not just those in the accounting department.

Though this step can be taken quickly, one should be mindful of the danger
of issuing a quantity of expensive parts to the shop floor that may quickly disap-
pear, resulting in a significant loss. For these few costly items, it may be better to


338 Inventory Best Practices

leave them in the warehouse. Also, there must be a tracking system in place on
the shop floor, whereby someone can check part bins and quickly determine
which parts must be reordered. There are a variety of simple systems available
that accomplish this, such as painting a reorder fill line in each storage tray, or
using a two-bin system, where parts are reordered as soon as one bin is emptied.
A manual reorder system is necessary for shop supplies, since it is no longer in
the inventory database, where reordering can be done automatically, based on
recorded inventory levels. Also, some of the parts being pulled from the ware-
house may be listed in bills of material, which can be a problem if a company
uses back-flushing. In this instance, items will be automatically withdrawn from
the quantity shown in the computer system as soon as production is recorded, so
the system will show negative usage of items that are no longer there. One should
carefully consider and resolve all of these problems before moving parts out of
inventory and into floor stock.

16-13 SEGREGATE CUSTOMER-OWNED INVENTORY

A dangerous problem for many controllers is incorrectly valuing inventory too
high because customer-owned inventory is mixed into it. This problem is espe-
cially common in cases where customers frequently ship components to a com-
pany for inclusion in finished products. This situation arises when a customer has
the rights to a proprietary product component, prefers to do some finishing work
on selected components, or only wants a company to do final assembly work on
its products. When any of these situations arise, the receiving staff commonly
makes the mistake of recording receipts as company-owned stock and storing it
alongside all other inventory in the warehouse. As a result, the inventory can be
massively overvalued, leading to incorrectly reported profits.

The best way to eliminate this problem is to institute procedures and set up
segregated areas that allow one to promptly identify customer-owned products at
the receiving dock and shunt them immediately to the segregated area. By doing
so, one can be assured of having much more accurate inventory quantities and
costs. To implement this best practice, it is critical to require a purchase order on
all items arriving at the receiving dock. With this procedure in place, the receiv-
ing staff can quickly identify all receipts that the purchasing department has pre-
viously noted on a purchase order as being owned by a customer. With this infor-
mation in hand, the receiving staff can easily record the entry in the computer
system and then move the items to a separately marked-off area. This approach
results in the storage of item quantity information in the computer system so the
warehouse staff can easily find the parts, but at a zero cost, meaning the account-
ing staff does not make the mistake of increasing the amount of company-owned
inventory.


16-14 Streamline the Physical Count Process 339

The main problem with using this methodology is that the purchasing and
warehousing departments must get used to issuing purchase orders for all items
received, while also rejecting all items shipped to the company without attached
purchase orders. Only by closely following these procedures can one be sure of
identifying all customer-owned inventory at the point of acceptance.

16-14 STREAMLINE THE PHYSICAL COUNT PROCESS

Some companies find that they are unable to produce anything for several days
while count teams perform a physical count of all on-hand inventory. When this
happens, a corporation loses sales, since it cannot produce anything. In addition,
the resulting inventory is not entirely accurate, since the counting process is fre-
quently conducted by people who do not have a thorough knowledge of what they
are counting, which results in incorrect counts and misidentified parts. Also, key
people are taken away from their other work to conduct the count, resulting in little
or no attention to customers for the duration of the count. Finally, the accounting
staff usually stops all other work in order to devote themselves to the processing of
count tags. Thus, the physical count is a highly disruptive and inaccurate process.
For those organizations that cannot entirely dispense with the physical count, it
is still possible to streamline the process so that fewer resources are assigned to it,
while keeping the accuracy level relatively high. The improvements are as follows:

¢ Eliminate some inventory from the count with cycle-counting. For situations
where a company has just started cycle-counting (see the ““Eliminate the Physi-
cal Count Process” section earlier in this chapter) but has not yet brought accu-
racy levels up to a sufficiently high level, it may still be possible to concentrate
the cycle-counting effort on a few key areas. By doing so, the accuracy of the
inventory in these locations will be so high that there is no need to conduct a
physical count.

¢ Enter location code on tags. When counters are entering information on
count tags, they should also enter a location code. With this information, it is
much easier for the accounting staff to later locate where a tag was used to
record information, rather than wandering through the warehouse in a frus-
trated search for the information. This approach is even better than the com-
mon practice of tracking blocks of tags that are assigned to teams counting
specific locations; though this brings a review person to the general vicinity
of an inventory item, it does not precisely identify the location, which leads
to lost time while someone searches for the part.

¢ Enter tags directly into the computer. It is much more efficient to directly
enter tag information into the computer system, rather than entering it into


340 Inventory Best Practices

an electronic spreadsheet for manual comparison to a computer-generated
inventory report. This approach allows the computer to automatically issue a
comparison of the counted quantities to the quantities already stored in the
computer, so that one can quickly determine where there may be counting
errors. Most good computer software packages contain this feature; if not,
one must evaluate the cost of programming the feature into the system.

¢ Identify all items in advance. A team should review the warehouse well in
advance of the physical count to spot all items that lack identifying part
numbers. By researching these items and correctly marking them in advance,
the counting teams do not have to address this task while also trying to count
inventory, thereby shortening the counting process.

¢ Only allow warehouse staff to count. Warehouse employees have an excel-
lent knowledge of all the parts stored in the warehouse and so are the most
qualified to identify and count inventory in the most efficient manner possi-
ble. If other, less knowledgeable people are brought into the counting
process, it is much more likely that there will be counting problems, result-
ing in wasted time at the end of the physical count, when extra counting
teams must be dispatched to research potential miscounts.

* Only conduct one count. Do not count something more than once! Though
some companies conduct a double count of all inventory items and then con-
duct a comparison of the two counts to spot errors, it is much easier and
faster to complete a single count and compare this to the book balances
already stored in the computer system. Conducting a double count adds to
the time and effort needed to complete the counting process.

¢ Precount the inventory. A team should begin counting the inventory days or
weeks in advance of the formal physical inventory count. This group’s job is
to gather inventory into single locations, count it, seal it into containers, and
mark the correct quantity on the containers. By doing so, it is much easier for
the physical count teams to complete their work in an efficient and accurate
manner. Though this may seem like a considerable amount of advance work
(it is), it results in a much shorter interval for the physical count, which
allows a company to be shut down only for the briefest possible time.

When these suggestions are implemented together or individually, a com-
pany will experience significant reductions in the effort needed to complete a
physical inventory, while increasing the accuracy of the resulting information.
For a more comprehensive best practice that entirely eliminates the need for a
physical count, continue on to the next section.

16-15 Track Inventory Accuracy 341

16-15 TRACK INVENTORY ACCURACY V Author's Choice

A controller is always concerned about the accuracy of the inventory. If it is off
by even a few percent at the end of the year, the annual physical count may result
in a large alteration in profits that will cost the controller his or her job on the
grounds that inaccurate financial statements have been issued. Furthermore, the
purchasing staff cannot properly order replacement parts if it does not have an
accurate idea of what is currently in stock, while the production department never
knows when parts that it needs for current jobs will not be in stock. Thus, all
these departments are deeply affected by the accuracy of the inventory.

The way to gain some assurance about overall levels of accuracy is to
track inventory accuracy with periodic audits. By doing so, one can determine
if there is an accuracy problem, resulting in further steps as outlined elsewhere
in this chapter, such as locking down the warehouse and shifting inventory
into the floor stock area. To review accuracy, one must be able to print out a
report from the computer system that shows the inventory in each warehouse
location. Then an accounting person should take a sample of items from this
list and verify that the items listed on it are indeed in stock in the correct
quantities, and that they are stored in the correct locations. Similarly, a small
sample of items should be traced from the shelf to the computer report to
verify that all items are being tracked in the computer system. The total of all
correct items should be divided by the total amount sampled to determine the
accuracy percentage. For even the largest warehouse, a sample size of 30
items is usually sufficient to determine the accuracy of the entire facility. This
information should be reported to management and posted for the warehouse
staff to see. By showing this information to the warehouse staff and tying a
series of bonus payments to it, one can be assured of an improvement in the
overall level of accuracy.

There is little resistance by anyone to tracking inventory accuracy, though
there are two systemic problems that may interfere with it. One is that the com-
puter system must be able to produce a report that sorts inventory by location—if
not, the auditing person will not be able to find items in the warehouse without a
long search, turning the audit into a tedious affair that can last hours. The other
problem is that the computer system must store location information for each
part. If parts are scattered throughout the warehouse with no record of their pre-
cise location, it will be exceedingly labor-intensive to track down anything. If
these two problems can be overcome, the auditing process becomes a simple and
mechanical one that only takes an hour or so to complete.

342 Inventory Best Practices

16-16 TRAIN THE WAREHOUSE AND ACCOUNTING STAFFS
IN INVENTORY PROCEDURES

The underlying problem behind the bulk of all inventory record errors is a lack of
knowledge by warehouse workers in how to process a variety of inventory transac-
tions. As a result, cycle-counting teams waste time investigating errors; the materials
planning staff must order parts on short notice due to unexplained materials shortfalls;
the company incurs express delivery charges to bring in parts on short notice; and the
accounting staff must record unexplained losses related to inventory adjustments.

Many of these problems can be mitigated by creating a procedures manual for all
inventory transactions and by continually training both the warehouse and accounting
staffs in their use. Examples of common inventory transactions are as follows:

¢ Back-flushing

¢ Consignment receipts and deliveries

¢ Cycle-counting adjustments

¢ Inventory storage in rack locations

¢ Issuances

¢ Issuances of additional parts

¢ Kitting

¢ Loaning inventory to departments

¢ Receiving

¢ Receiving customer returns

¢ Removing defective parts from the production process
¢ Returning defective parts to suppliers

¢ Returning stock to the warehouse from the shop floor
¢ Shipping completed customer orders

¢ Staging for shipping

¢ Transferring between inventory locations

It is not enough to simply create a handsome procedures manual and issue it
to the staff. On the contrary, all employees involved with these transactions should
go through regular refresher training, while new employees should be trained sev-
eral times early in their employment and be certified by an experienced coworker
as to their knowledge of the procedures. Further, any procedural change calls for
a complete retraining of the entire staff on that topic. Only by enforcing the cor-
porate commitment to training in inventory procedures can a company reduce its
incidence of inventory transaction errors.

Total Impact of Best Practices on the Inventory Function 343

16-17 VERIFY THAT ALL RECEIPTS ARE ENTERED
IN THE COMPUTER AT ONCE

There is nothing that throws a wrench into a company’s production planning
and accounting more than the delayed entry of warehouse receiving into the
computer system. When this happens (or rather, when it does not happen), the
purchasing staff does not know if materials have arrived and they begin a series
of frantic calls to suppliers to determine when items are to be shipped. Like-
wise, the production scheduling staff decide not to produce something because
they do not see any receipt in the computer system. Finally, the accounting staff
has a very difficult time determining what was really received at the end of the
accounting period, resulting in the reporting of inaccurate inventory figures in
the financial statements. All this because someone in the warehouse is slow in
entering receipts.

The obvious best practice is to make the warehouse staff make their receiving
entries as soon as they receive any parts, but the solution is not quite so simple.
The underlying reason why receipts are not being entered at once is probably
because the staff is too busy to do it, and so this chore waits until a slow period,
perhaps at the end of the day. Thus, to make them enter receipts more quickly, one
must find a better way to enter the receipts, one that is so simple and easy there is
no excuse to delay the process. One way is to require all suppliers to attach a bar-
coded sheet to all shipments, allowing the receiving staff to scan this sheet directly
into the computer system, thereby recording the entry. This is a quick and easy
way to approach the receiving data-entry task. Another is to restructure the receiv-
ing data-entry screen so that one only needs to enter the purchase order number
upon which any receipt is based. The purchase order then comes up on the screen,
and the receiver quickly notes the quantity received. This latter approach is also a
good way to pay customers without the extra effort of using the accounts payable
staff (see Chapter 3). The latter approach carries with it the added benefit of forc-
ing suppliers to provide only the purchase order number with their shipments —
many suppliers resist having to bar code the information on their shipments. Either
technique is an effective way to reduce the time needed to enter receipts, thereby
eliminating a host of downstream problems.

TOTAL IMPACT OF BEST PRACTICES
ON THE INVENTORY FUNCTION

The impact of the best practices described in this chapter on the inventory func-
tion is a considerable increase in the accuracy of inventory information. They
are not designed to directly improve the functions of the warehouse, since this
book only deals with accounting improvements. Nonetheless, it would be surprising


344 Inventory Best Practices

if the warehouse personnel were not to experience a much easier existence if they
had certain knowledge of the exact quantities and locations of all the parts located
in the warehouse. As for the accounting staff, improved inventory accuracy leads
to much less concern about the accuracy of the inventory and cost-of-goods-sold
figures noted in the balance sheet and income statement, respectively. Further,
the purchasing staff have a much easier time ordering parts, since they have much
better knowledge of the accuracy of the on-hand inventory balances and no
longer need to make a trip to the warehouse to verify this information. Finally,
the production department will no longer experience parts shortages due to inac-
curate inventory balances, resulting in the timely completion of more production
runs. Thus, the best practices shown graphically in Exhibit 16.2 are unique
among the best practices listed in this book in that their beneficial impact spreads
far beyond the accounting department.

Two of the best practices noted in Exhibit 16.2 are mutually exclusive, so
one would not need to implement both—just one or the other. One cannot lock
down the warehouse while eliminating the entire function at the same time. The
choice of which one to use is up to the individual company, though most choose
locking down the warehouse. The reason is that this approach is vastly easier to
implement than the complete elimination of all inventory, which is the only way
in which the warehouse can be eliminated. Alternatively, the latter approach
requires a long-term commitment to just-in-time production and purchasing prin-
ciples, and usually takes years to implement.

SUMMARY

This chapter covered a number of best practices that honed in on improving the
accuracy of the inventory database. By doing so, the accounting department can
be assured of much better accuracy in the inventory valuation figures it records in
the financial statements, which has the related benefit of reducing any chance of
error in the reported level of profitability.

Unfortunately, the bulk of the best practices noted here are ones that must be
implemented and maintained by the warehouse and engineering departments,
which means that the controller cannot use any direct authority to ensure their
completion and use. Instead, this is a case where active persuasion is the key
component of the implementation effort on the part of the controller.

Payroll Best Practices

The payroll function involves a large clerical workload occurring shortly before
and at the end of each pay period. For example, the typical payroll department
collects time cards, calculates the amount due, plus overtime premiums, checks
with supervisors regarding questionable time cards, subtracts deductions of vari-
ous kinds, cuts the checks, issues them, and reconciles any differences when
employees bring in their paychecks with questions. After this frenetic time
period, there is little for the department to do—until the end of the next pay
period arrives. This highly predictable surge and drop in the payroll staff’s work-
load can be a difficult one for a controller to manage because it requires either
large amounts of overtime by the payroll staff during the heaviest work periods or
else a redistribution of the accounting department staff to assist in the effort from
time to time. It is best to avoid the problems associated with periodic strains on
the staffing of the accounting department by examining each step of the payroll
process and streamlining it to reduce the overall workload. This chapter contains
a number of best practices that assist in doing so.

Another problem with the payroll function is that it is very error-prone. For
example, it is easy to miss a pay raise, a vacation accrual, or a deduction. Every
time this happens, an employee will arrive with questions he or she wants
answered on the spot, which seriously impairs the efficiency of the department.
In addition, these problems create concern on the part of employees that their
paychecks are not being correctly calculated, which causes them to review pay
data even more carefully, which in turn brings even more employees to the pay-
roll department, requesting investigation of their problems. Thus, payroll errors
not only require valuable time to fix, but also bring about a decline in employee
confidence in the accounting department. This chapter contains several best prac-
tices that will reduce or eliminate many payroll errors.

Though this chapter reveals many techniques for reducing the workload and
error rate of the payroll staff, there are no methods for entirely sidestepping the
process, as is the case in the accounts payable area, so most of the best practices
described here are incremental in nature. The remainder of this chapter describes
the implementation problems associated with each best practice, followed by a
description of each one.

A danger of using the table in Exhibit 17.1 to pick only the easiest best prac-
tices is that these are primarily “quick hits” that will generally have a relatively
small impact on the overall level of efficiency of the payroll function. Accordingly,
it is important to insert changes that require greater implementation effort and that
have a correspondingly higher payback. For example, adding direct deposit is an
easy and popular improvement, but a more fundamental change that requires much
persuasion and more time to implement is reducing the number of payroll cycles.
Creating a mix of both easy and difficult projects is key to showing continuing suc-
cesses, while working toward greater levels of efficiency over the long term.

The reader should use Exhibit 17.1 to select the best practices listed in the
remainder of this chapter that most closely match specific company requirements.

17-1 DISALLOW PREPAYMENTS

Many employees do not have the monetary resources to see them through until
the next payday. Their solution is to request a pay advance, which is repaid at the
time of the next payday. It is a humane gesture on the part of the payroll manager
to comply with such requests, but it plays havoc with the efficiency of the payroll
department. Whenever such a request is made, the payroll staff must manually
calculate the taxes to take out of the payment, then manually cut a check and have
it signed. However, the inefficiencies are not yet over! In addition, the staff must
manually enter the pay advance in the computer system so that the amount is
deducted from the next paycheck. For larger advances, it may be necessary to
make deductions over several paychecks, which requires even more work.
Clearly, paycheck prepayments do not help the efficiency of the payroll depart-

ment. This is a particularly large problem in companies where a large proportion
of the employees are paid at or near the minimum wage, since these people do
not receive enough money to meet their needs.

The best practice that solves this problem seems simple, but can be surprisingly
difficult to implement. One must create a rule that no paycheck prepayments will be
handed out, which effectively ends the extra processing required of the payroll per-
sonnel. The trouble with this rule is that a needy employee can usually present such
a good case for a pay advance that exceptions will be made, which grinds away at
the rule over time until it is completely ignored. Other managers will assist in tearing
down the rule by complaining that they will lose good employees if advances are not
provided to them. The best possible way to stand firm with the rule is for a company
to form an association with a local lending institution that specializes in short-term
loans. Then, if an employee requests an advance, he or she can be directed to the
lending institution, which will arrange for an interest-bearing loan to the employee.
When this arrangement exists, it is common for employees to tighten their budgets
rather than pay the extra interest charged for use of the lender’s money. This
improves employee finances while increasing the processing efficiency of the pay-
roll staff. In short, this best practice involves two steps: prohibiting pay advances,
while at the same time arranging for alternative financing for employees.

17-2 GIVE EMPLOYEES DIRECT ACCESS TO DEDUCTION DATA

A major task for the payroll staff is to meet with employees to go over the effect
of any deduction changes they wish to make, calculate the changes, and enter
them into the payroll database. This can be a particularly time-consuming task if
the number of possible deduction options is large, if employees are allowed to
make deduction changes at any time, or if employees are not well educated in the
impact of deduction changes on their net pay.

A particularly elegant best practice that resolves this problem is to give
employees direct access to the deduction data so they can determine the impact of
deduction changes themselves and enter the changes directly into the payroll
database. To do so, one must construct an interface to the payroll database that
lists all deductions taken from employee paychecks (with the exception of gar-
nishments, which employees would be tempted to reduce to zero). However, this
is not enough, for most deductions are usually tied to a benefit of some kind. For
example, a deduction for a medical plan can only be changed if the underlying
medical plan option is altered. Accordingly, an employee needs access to a “‘split
screen” of information, with one side showing benefit options and the other side
showing the employee’s gross pay, all deductions, and net pay. This view allows
one to modify deductions and watch the impact on net pay. Examples of deduc-
tions for which this data view will work are:


350 Payroll Best Practices

¢ Federal tax deductions
¢ State tax deductions

¢ Medical plan coverage
¢ Dental plan coverage
¢ 401(k) deductions

An example of this approach is a dental plan. On one side of the computer
screen, an employee is presented with five dental plan options, all with different
costs. The employee can scroll through the list and select any option, while
watching the selection automatically change the payroll calculation on the other
side of the screen. Once the employee finds a selection that works best, he or she
presses a button and the change is entered into the payroll system. Such a system
usually includes some selection blocks so that an uncertain employee does not
constantly change deductions. For example, the software may contain a limita-
tion of one health plan change per year.

This approach completely eliminates all work by the payroll staff to enter
deduction changes into the computer. An added benefit is that employees are
responsible for their own data-entry mistakes. If they make an incorrect entry,
they can go into the system themselves and correct it. The system can also be
expanded to include other data items, such as employee addresses and phone
numbers. In addition, the deduction modeling system just noted allows employees
to determine precisely what their net pay will be, eliminating any surprises. In a
more traditional system, an employee might make a deduction change without
realizing the full impact of the change on his or her net pay and end up back in
the payroll office, demanding a reversion back to the old deduction level. By
using the modeling system, the payroll staff can eliminate such multiple visits
from employees.

This system is extremely useful for eliminating several payroll processing
tasks, but it will only work if a company is willing to invest in the custom design
of an employee interface, as well as the provision of computers to all employees
who want to access the payroll system in this manner. Given the cost of the sys-
tem, it is most commonly found only in larger companies with many employees,
where the cost-benefit trade-off is very clear cut. That said, some Internet-based
payroll and human resources application service providers have incorporated
direct employee access features into their offerings, making this best practice
available to much smaller companies than was previously the case. For example,
the www.probusiness.com site allows employees to view and print their W-2
forms, change direct deposit designations, view up to three years of pay history,
view company pay dates, and verify paid time off balances—all via any Web
browser and without requiring any preloaded software.

In short, using a special payroll interface to give employees direct access to
their own payroll deduction information is an excellent way to lessen the work of

the payroll department, while also giving employees greater control over the benefit
plans they want.

17-3 MINIMIZE PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS

A company can offer a large number of benefits to its employees, many of which
require some sort of deduction from payroll. For example, a company can set up
deductions for employee medical, dental, life, and supplemental life insurance, as
well as cafeteria plan deductions for medical insurance or child care payments
and 401(k) deductions. If there are many employees and many deduction types,
the payroll staff can be snowed under at payroll processing time by the volume of
changes continually occurring in this area. Also, whenever there is a change in
the underlying cost of insurance provided to the company, the company com-
monly passes along some portion of these costs to the employees, resulting in a
massive updating of deductions for all employees who take that particular type of
insurance. This not only takes time away from other, more value-added account-
ing tasks, but also is subject to error, so that adjustments must later be made to
correct the errors, which requires even more staff time.

There are several ways to address this problem. One is to eliminate the
employee-paid portion of some types of insurance. For example, if the cost to the
company for monthly dental insurance is $20 per employee, and the related deduc-
tion is only $2 per person, management can elect to pay for the entire cost, rather
than burden the accounting staff with the tracking of this trivial sum. Another
alternative is to eliminate certain types of benefits, such as supplemental life
insurance or 401(k) loans, in order to eliminate the related deductions. Yet another
alternative is to create a policy that limits employee changes to any benefit plans,
so they can only make a small number of changes per year. This eliminates the
continual changing of deduction amounts in favor of just a few large bursts of
activity at prescheduled times during the year. A very good alternative is to create
a benefit package for all employees that requires a single deduction of the same
amount for everyone, or for a group (such as one deduction for single employees
and another for employees with families); employees can then pick and choose
the exact amount of each type of benefit they want within the boundaries of each
benefit package, without altering the amount of the underlying deduction. This
last alternative has the unique advantage of consolidating all deductions into a
single item, which is much simpler to administer. Any of these approaches to the
problem will reduce the number or timing of deduction changes, thereby reduc-
ing the workload of the payroll staff.

17-4 PROHIBIT DEDUCTIONS FOR EMPLOYEE PURCHASES

Many companies allow their employees to use corporate discounts to buy prod-
ucts through them. For example, a company may have obtained a large discount
on furniture from a supplier. Its employees buy at the discounted rate and then
have the deductions subtracted from their paychecks in convenient installments.
Some employees make excessive use of this benefit, purchasing all kinds of sup-
plies through the company; accordingly, it is common to see a very small minor-
ity of employees making up the bulk of these purchases. The problem for the pay-
roll staff is that it must keep track of the total amount that each employee owes
the company and gradually deduct the amount owed from successive paychecks.
If an employee has multiple purchases, the payroll staff must constantly recalcu-
late the amount to be deducted. Depending on the number of employees taking
advantage of purchases through the company, this can have a measurable impact
on the efficiency of the payroll department.

The apparently easy solution to the employee purchases problem is to pro-
hibit purchases. By doing so, all the extra paperwork associated with employee
purchases is immediately swept away. Though a good best practice for most com-
panies to implement, this is one that should first be cleared with senior manage-
ment. The reason is that some employees may be so accustomed to purchasing
through the company that they will be rudely surprised by the change, which may
be something that management wants to avoid (especially if valuable employees
will be irritated by the change). Also, some companies have valid reasons for
allowing employee purchases. The most common situation is when employees
buy products that are meant to be used at work, such as work boots or tools. In
these cases, the reasons in favor of maintaining a purchasing program may out-
weigh the reduced efficiency of the payroll department. A possible alternative
approach that will still eliminate payroll deductions is to still allow employee
purchases, but on condition that either the purchases are billed straight to them,
or that the employees pay the company in full as soon as the goods are received.

In short, eliminating employee purchases that require deductions is a simple
best practice to implement, though there are employee relations issues that may
keep it from being implemented.

17-5 AUTOMATE FAX-BACK OF PAYROLL FORMS

A payroll clerk is the unofficial keeper of the payroll and human resources forms.
Employees come to this person to collect these sheets, which can vary from a
request to change a payroll deduction to a request to change a 401(k) deduction
amount. If a company has many employees, or if there are many company loca-


17-6 Post Forms on an Intranet Site 353

tions, which necessitates putting a form in an envelope and mailing it, the chore
of handing out forms can take up a large amount of staff time.

To avoid distributing forms to employees, it is possible to set up an auto-
mated fax-back program. This best practice involves having employees contact a
computer, either using a Touch-Tone phone or through the computer system, and
request that the appropriate form be sent to a fax number close to the employee.
The computer has all the forms digitized and stored in its memory, and can make
the transmission with no human intervention. For example, an employee accesses
the system through a computer, scrolls through a list of available forms, high-
lights the needed item, enters his or her fax number, and logs off. The form
arrives a few moments later. The process is noted in more detail in Exhibit 17.2.

Besides the obvious advantage of eliminating some effort by the payroll
staff, an automated fax-back system also has the advantage of always distributing
the most recent forms, which means that forms employees submit to the payroll
staff never have to be thrown out and resubmitted, since employees always obtain
the correct ones. Under a manual distribution system, it is common practice to
issue large quantities of forms to outlying locations, so that employees do not
constantly call and ask for more forms; however, these forms end up being used
for a long time, frequently past the date when they are obsolete. Using an auto-
mated fax-back system eliminates this problem. In addition, the system can auto-
matically send along an extra instruction sheet with each distributed form so that
employees can easily fill out forms on their own, with no need to bother the pay-
roll staff for help. These extra advantages will tip the scales in favor of the system
for many companies.

An automated fax-back system can be rather expensive, so it is necessary to
determine all costs prior to undertaking an implementation. The system includes
a separate file server linked to one or more phone lines (for receiving Touch-Tone
phone requests, as well as for sending forms out to fax machines), plus a scanner
for digitizing payroll forms. The best way to justify these added costs is if there
are a large number of employees to be serviced, which saves a significant portion
of staff time. If there are not enough employees to justify the system, it should
not be installed.

17-6 POST FORMS ON AN INTRANET SITE WV Author’s Choice

Employees frequently come to the accounting department to ask for any of the
variety of forms required for changes to their payroll status, such as the IRS’ W-4
form, address changes, cafeteria plan sign-up or change forms, and so on. These
constant interruptions interfere with the orderly flow of accounting work, espe-
cially when the department runs out of a form and must scramble to replenish its
supplies.


354 Payroll Best Practices

This problem is neatly solved by converting all forms to Adobe Acrobat’s
PDF format and posting them on a company intranet site for downloading by all
employees. By using this approach, no one ever has to approach the accounting
staff for the latest copy of a form. Also, employees can download the required
form from anywhere, rather than having to wait until they are near the accounting
location to physically pick one up. Further, the accounting staff can regularly
update the PDF forms on the intranet site, so there is no risk of someone using an
old and outmoded form.

Converting a regular form to PDF format is simple. First, purchase the Acro-
bat software from Adobe’s Web site and install it. Then access a form in whatever

17-7 AVOID JOB COSTING THROUGH THE PAYROLL SYSTEM

Some controllers have elaborate cost accounting systems set up that accumulate a
variety of costs from many sources, sometimes to be used for activity-based costing
and, more frequently, for job costing. One of these costs is labor, which is some-
times accumulated through the payroll system. When this is done, employees use
lengthy time cards where they record the time spent on many activities during the
day, resulting in vastly longer payroll records than would otherwise be the case.
This is a problem when the payroll staff is asked to sort through and add up all of
the job-costing records, since this increases the workload of the payroll personnel
by an order of magnitude. In addition, the payroll staff may be asked to enter the
job-costing information that it has just compiled into the job-costing database,
which is yet another task that gets in the way of processing the payroll.

The obvious solution is to not allow job costing to be merged into the payroll
function, thereby allowing the payroll staff to vastly reduce the amount of work it
must complete, as well as shrink the number of opportunities for calculation
errors. However, this step may meet with opposition from those people who need
the job-costing records. There are several ways to avoid conflict over the issue.
One is to analyze who is charging time to various projects or activities and see if
the proportions of time charged vary significantly over time; if they do not, there
is no reason to continue tracking job-costing information for hours worked.
Another possibility is to split the functions so that the payroll staff collects its
payroll data independently of the job-costing data collection, which can be han-
dled by someone else. Either possibility will keep the job-costing function from
interfering with the orderly collection of payroll information.

17-8 SWITCH TO SALARIED POSITIONS

When processing payroll, it is evident that the labor required to process the payroll
for a salaried person is significantly lower than the labor needed to process pay-
roll for an hourly employee. The reason is that there is no change in the payroll
data from period to period for a salaried person, whereas the number of hours
worked must be recomputed for an hourly employee every time the payroll is


356 Payroll Best Practices

processed. Therefore, it is reasonable to try to shift as many employees as possible
over to salaried positions from hourly ones in order to reduce the labor of calcu-
lating payroll.

Implementing this best practice can be a significant problem. One issue is that
it is not under the control of the accounting department—it is up to the managers
of other departments to switch people over to salaried positions, so the controller
must rely on persuasion of other managers to make the concept a reality. Another
problem is that this best practice tends to run into opposition from unions. They
prefer to keep the employees they represent on hourly pay, since this gives
employees the opportunity to earn overtime. If a union has a strong presence in a
company, this will almost certainly keep a company from switching people to
salaried positions for at least those employees who are represented by the union.
Finally, there may be legal issues that get in the way of making this conversion
work. There are frequently regulations at the state level that prohibit converting
employees to salaried positions, with the main determining criterion being that a
salaried person must be able to act with minimal supervision—this situation will
vary by state, depending on local laws. All of these issues can impede the imple-
mentation of a complete conversion of employees to salaried pay.

Given the number of implementation problems just mentioned, it may seem
impossible to implement this best practice. However, it is quite possible in some
industries. The main factor for success is that the industry have few hourly workers
to begin with. For example, a company with many highly educated employees, or
one that performs limited manufacturing, may already have so many salaried
employees that it becomes a minor cleanup issue to convert over the few remaining
hourly employees to salaried positions with a minimum of difficulty. Consequently,
it is only possible to completely implement this best practice in certain industries —
it should not be attempted in those cases where there is already a high proportion of
hourly workers who are spread through many departments, especially when their
hourly pay status is protected by a union or local laws.

17-9 USE BAR CODED TIME CLOCKS

The single most labor-intensive task in the payroll area is calculating hours
worked for hourly employees. To do so, an accounting clerk must collect all the
employee time cards for the most recently completed payroll period, manually
add up the hours listed on the cards, and research missing hours with supervisors.
This is a very lengthy process and usually has a very high error rate, due to the
large percentage of missing start or stop times on most time cards. The errors are
usually found by employees as soon as they are paid, resulting in a loud and
(sometimes) boisterous visit to the payroll department, demanding an immediate
adjustment to the paid amount with a manual paycheck. This disrupts the payroll


17-9 Use Bar Coded Time Clocks 357

department and introduces additional inefficiencies to the process. Improving the
process would create a grateful payroll staff!

A common solution to these problems is to install a computerized time
clock. This is a clock that requires an employee to “swipe” an employee-specific
plastic card through the clock. The card is encoded with an employee-identifying
number, using either a bar code or a magnetic stripe. Once the swipe occurs, the
clock automatically stores the date and time, and downloads this data upon
request to the payroll department’s computer, where special software automati-
cally calculates hours worked and highlights any problems for additional
research (such as missed swipes). Many such clocks can be installed throughout a
large facility, or at outlying locations, so that employees can conveniently record
their time, no matter where they may be. The more advanced clocks also track
the time periods when employees are supposed to arrive and leave, and require
a supervisor’s password for card swipes outside of that time period—this feature
allows for greater control over employee work hours. Many of these systems
also issue absence reports at any time, so that supervisors can easily tell who
has not shown up for work. Thus, an automated time clock eliminates much low-
end clerical work, while at the same time providing new management tools for
supervisors.

Before purchasing a bar coded time clock, it is important to recognize its limi-
tations. The most important one is cost. This type of time clock usually costs
$2,000 to $3,000, or can be leased for several hundred dollars per month. If several
clocks are needed, this can add up to a substantial investment. In addition, outlying
time clocks that must download their information to a computer at a distant location
require their own phone lines, which represents an additional monthly payment to
the phone company. There may also be a fee for using the software on the central
computer that summarizes all the incoming payroll information. Given these costs,
it is most common for bar coded time clocks to be used only in those situations
where there are so many hourly employees in a company that there is a significant
time savings in the payroll department resulting from their installation.

A key flaw of the bar coded time clock is that employees can use each other’s
cards to clock themselves in, resulting in payments for time worked to employees
who may not have even been on the premises. To avoid this problem, one can
install an Internet camera next to the clock that snaps an image for every card
swipe made and stores it elsewhere for easy access by the payroll staff. The infor-
mation can be stored for a few weeks in this manner until there is no need for the
information, and then written over. By using this approach, employees will be
much less inclined to clock in or out for their buddies, while the payroll staff will
have ready evidence of improper card swipes. The main problem with this
approach is the difficulty of linking information from the card swipe to the image
created by the camera, so one can tell what information was entered into the sys-
tem by each person.

17-10 USE BIOMETRIC TIME CLOCKS

The bar coded time clocks noted in the last best practice represent a wonderful
improvement in the speed and accuracy with which employee time data can be
collected. However, it suffers from an integrity flaw — that employees can use
each other’s badges to enter and exit from the payroll system. This means that
some employees may be paid for hours when they were never really on-site at all.
A division of Ingersoll-Rand has surmounted this problem with the use of bio-
metric time clocks.

Recognition Systems is a company that sells the punch biometric time clock
(as shown at www.handreader.com). It requires an employee to place his or her
hand on a sensor, which matches its size and shape to the dimensions already
recorded for that person in a central database. The time entered into the terminal
will then be recorded against the payroll file of the person whose hand was just
measured. Thus, only employees who are on-site can have payroll hours credited
to them. The company sells a variation on the same machine, called the HandKey,
which is used to control access to secure areas. These systems have a secondary
benefit, which is that no one needs an employee badge or pass key; these tend to
be lost or damaged over time, and so represent a minor headache for the account-
ing or human resources staffs, who must track them. In a biometric monitoring
environment, all an employee needs is a hand.

17-11 USE HONOR SYSTEM TO TRACK VACATION
AND SICK TIME

It is common for the payroll staff to be in charge of tracking the vacation and sick
time used by employees. This involves sending out forms for employees to fill
out whenever they take time off, usually requiring their supervisor’s signature.
Upon receipt, the payroll staff logs the used time in the payroll system and files
the forms away in employee personnel folders. If the payroll staff does not
account for this information correctly in the payroll system, employees will prob-
ably spot the problem on their remittance advices the next time they are paid and
will go to the payroll office to look into the matter. These inquiries take up
accounting staff time, as does the paperwork tracking effort.

When used with some control features, it is possible to completely eliminate
the tracking of vacation and sick time by the payroll staff. Under this scenario,
employees are placed on the honor system of tracking their own vacation and
sick time. Though this system keeps the payroll staff from having to do any track-
ing of this information, there is also a strong possibility that some employees will
abuse the situation and take extra time. There are two ways to avoid this problem.
One is to institute a companywide policy that automatically wipes out all earned

vacation and sick time at the end of each calendar year, which has the advantage
of limiting the amount of vacation and sick time to which an employee can claim
that he or she is entitled. This step mitigates a company’s losses if a dishonest
employee leaves the company and claims payment for many hours of vacation
and sick time that may go back many years. The other way to avoid the problem
is to switch the tracking role to employee supervisors. These people are in the
best position to see when employees are taking time off and can track their time
off much more easily than can the payroll staff. In short, with some relatively
minor control changes, it is possible to use an honor system to track employee
usage of vacation and sick time.

17-12 ISSUE ELECTRONIC W-2 FORMS TO EMPLOYEES

A large company can experience some difficulty in issuing W-2 forms to its
employees if they are distributed over a wide area. The mailing cost of this distri-
bution can also be quite expensive, especially if the employer wants proof of
receipt, which calls for the use of more expensive overnight delivery services.
This problem can be avoided by issuing electronic W-2 forms to employees,
thereby avoiding all related postage costs.

The IRS has issued specific regulations for the use of electronic W-2 forms.
First, employees must give their consent to the receipt of an electronic W-2 form,
and do so electronically, thereby showing proof that they are capable of receiving
the electronic format in which the W-2 form will be sent. Second, the W-2 forms
must contain all standard information that would normally be found on a paper
W-2 form. Third, employees must be notified that the forms have been posted on
a Web site for their access, and give them instructions on how to access the infor-
mation. Finally, the access must be maintained through October 15 of the year
following the calendar year to which they relate.

These regulations are not difficult to meet, and the use of a central Web site
for storage of the information also allows the employer to determine precisely
which W-2 forms have been accessed. However, it is likely that some employees
who either have minimal access to computers or who are not computer literate
will not access their W-2 forms in this manner, requiring a last-minute distribu-
tion of W-2 forms to anyone who has not accessed their electronic copies. Also,
paper-based W-2 forms must still be issued to any employees who left the com-
pany prior to the end of the calendar year. Thus, this best practice will likely
result in only a partial electronic distribution of W-2 forms.

17-13 OFFER CLEAR CARDS TO EMPLOYEES

Employees can find themselves in credit trouble from time to time, frequently
resulting in requests for payroll advances to their employers in order to meet
pressing bill payments. A payroll advance is a time-consuming item to handle,
because it involves the creation of a manual check, clearing the check on the next
bank reconciliation, and offsetting the advance on the next pay check.

An alternative to the payroll advance is to offer a “Clear Card” to employees.
Under this approach, an employee pays for something with a MasterCard and
then has the payment automatically deducted from his or per paycheck over the
next two months, with no interest or late fees charged on the payment. Employ-
ees pay $29 per year for this service, while the employer pays no fee at all. The
credit card provider installs the automatic linkage through the corporate payroll
system to process payroll deductions, and does so free of charge. The card is only
available to employees earning at least $20,000 per year and who have worked
for a company at least six months. The credit limit on the card is 2.5 percent for
those earning less than $75,000 per year, with a 4 percent limit for those earning
above this amount.

Though the card has the clear advantage of offering a ready source of credit
to employees who may otherwise not have available funds, it can also reduce
their ready income if they constantly buy the maximum amount available to
them, which may send them back to the company once again to ask for a payroll
advance.

17-14 SEND REMITTANCES AS E-MAIL MESSAGES

A company may go to a great deal of trouble to install a direct deposit option in
order to avoid sending checks to employees, only to find that it must still send a
remittance advice, which lists the amounts paid and incidental data such as vaca-
tion or sick time earned. Because a company must send its employees some evi-
dence of payment, it is difficult to avoid this distribution step.

A possible solution is to send remittances as e-mail messages, though there
are some problems with this approach. This system works by having the payroll
system compile a set of electronic messages after each payroll run, which are
then loaded into a company’s e-mail system for distribution to employees.
Though this seems like a relatively simple approach, there are a number of issues
to overcome before it will work in a reliable manner. They are as follows:

* Custom programming. The existing payroll software must be modified to
allow for automated e-mail transmissions. The amount of programming
required can be considerable, depending on the complexity of the software.


17-15 Transfer Payroll to Credit Card Balances 361

Also, if the software is a ‘‘canned” package that is periodically upgraded by
a supplier, the custom programming may not work after the next upgrade,
since the underlying software code will change.

* Outsourced payroll. If a company’s payroll is outsourced to a supplier, then
the payroll software is probably off-site, at the supplier’s computer center. If
so, it is highly unlikely that the supplier will agree to customize its payroll
software to transmit e-mail messages.

¢ Existing e-mail system. It is impossible to send e-mail messages to employ-
ees if there is not a preexisting e-mail system in place to which all employees
are connected. Such a system must be installed before e-mailing payroll
remittances can be considered.

¢ Employee access to computers. An obvious problem is having employees,
such as production workers, without ready access to computers on which
they can check their e-mail. It is possible to avoid this issue by installing
free-standing kiosks where all employees can check their e-mail. Another
option is to send remittances to the e-mail of employee supervisors, who can
then print out the messages and distribute them. Yet another option is to send
printed remittances to those employees without e-mail, and e-mail remit-
tances to those who can receive them in this manner.

¢ Lost e-mail. It is all too easy to press the “delete” button and see an e-mail
message disappear forever. This can be a problem if the deleted e-mail hap-
pens to contain a payroll remittance. To avoid this problem, it may be neces-
sary to allow employees to send an e-mail request to the payroll department to
request either a new e-mail remittance or a hard copy of the remittance (which
may be necessary for other reasons, such as mortgage applications that require
a payroll remittance). It may even be possible to have employees contact the
payroll database themselves to have a remittance printed out on a local printer,
but this option carries the risk of having an employee discover the passwords
for other employees, and then print out their payroll remittances, too.

Despite the number of complications that can arise when installing this best
practice, it is still useful under certain situations. It is of most use in such service
industries as insurance, where nearly all employees have computers, and proba-
bly ill-advised in most production industries, where too few employees have
ready access to this form of communication. Thus, the distribution of computers
among employees is critical to the success of e-mailed payroll remittances.

17-15 TRANSFER PAYROLL TO CREDIT CARD BALANCES

Some companies employ people who, for whatever reason, either are unable to
set up personal bank accounts or do not choose to. In these cases, they must take


362 Payroll Best Practices

their paychecks to a check-cashing service, which charges them a high fee to
convert the check into cash. Not only is it expensive, but the check-cashing service
can have a long approval process. Also, employees will be carrying large
amounts of cash just after cashing their checks, which increases their risk of
theft. They also run the risk of losing their paychecks prior to cashing them.
Thus, the lack of a bank account poses serious problems for a company’s
employees.

A good solution to this problem is to set up a Visa debit card, called the Visa
Paycard, for any employees requesting one, and then shift payroll funds directly
into the card. This allows employees to pull any amount of cash they need from
an ATM, rather than the entire amount at one time from a check-cashing service.
The card can also be used like a credit card, so there is little need to make pur-
chases with cash. Further, the fee to convert to cash at an ATM is much lower
than the fee charged by a check-cashing service. There is also less risk of theft
through the card, since it is protected by a personal identification number (PIN).
Employees will also receive a monthly statement showing their account activity,
which they can use to get a better idea of their spending habits.

Using this card can be difficult for anyone who speaks English as a second
language or who cannot understand ATM instructions. However, Visa offers multi-
lingual customer service personnel, which reduces the severity of this problem.

The Paycard has only recently been rolled out by Visa, and is only available
through a few banks. One must contact the corporate bank to see if it has this option
available. If not, an alternative is to switch the payroll function to the Paymaxx
Internet site (found at www.paymaxx.com), which offers the Paycard option.

17-16 USE DIRECT DEPOSIT

A major task for the payroll staff is to issue paychecks to employees. This task
can be subdivided into several subsidiary steps. First, the checks must be
printed—though it seems easy, it is all too common for the check run to fail,
resulting in the manual cancellation of the first batch of checks, followed by a
new print run. Next, the checks must be signed by an authorized check-signer,
who may have questions about payment amounts, which may require additional
investigation. After that, the checks must be stuffed into envelopes and then
sorted by supervisor (since supervisors generally hand out checks to their
employees). The checks are then distributed, usually with the exception of a few
checks that will be held for those employees who are not currently on-site for
later pick-up. Finally, the person in charge of the bank reconciliation must track
those checks that have not been cashed and follow up with employees to get them
to cash their checks—there are usually a few employees who prefer to cash
checks only when they need the money, surprising though this may seem. In


17-16 Use Direct Deposit 363

short, there are a startlingly large number of steps involved in issuing payroll
checks to employees. How can one eliminate this work?

Converting to direct deposit is a simple way to eliminate the distribution of
paychecks. This best practice involves issuing payments directly to employee
bank accounts. Besides avoiding some of the steps involved with issuing pay-
checks, it carries the additional advantage of putting money in employee bank
accounts at once, so that those employees who are off-site on payday do not have
to worry about how they will receive their money —it will appear in their check-
ing accounts automatically, with no effort on their part.

Implementing direct deposit can be somewhat more difficult than one may
first realize. It requires an ability to transfer payment information to the company’s
bank in the correct direct deposit format, which the bank uses to shift money to
employee bank accounts. This information transfer can be accomplished either by
purchasing an add-on to a company’s in-house payroll software or by paying extra
to a payroll outsourcing company to provide the service; either way, there is an
expense associated with starting up the service. An example of a payroll add-on
service is www.directdeposit.com; its Easy Direct Deposit product allows one to
download payroll information from such popular accounting programs as Quick-
Books, Peachtree, and DacEasy, and transmit this information to a direct deposit
processing center that handles all direct deposits. Also, it can be difficult to get all
employees to switch over to direct deposit. Though the benefits to employees may
seem obvious, there will be a large proportion of employees who prefer to cash
their own checks, or who do not possess bank accounts. To get around this prob-
lem, a company can either force all employees to accept direct deposit, or only do
so with new employees, with existing employees being allowed to still take paper
checks. If employees are forced to accept direct deposit, the company can make
the issue less onerous by working with a local bank to provide a free bank account
to each employee. Also, there will be the inevitable start-up problems for the first
few weeks, resulting in some direct deposits not going through to employees on
time. All of these issues make implementing direct deposit somewhat more diffi-
cult and expensive than would first appear to be the case.

Besides implementation issues, there are a few other problems to consider
before using direct deposit. One is the fee charged by the bank or payroll ser-
vice to do it—a common charge is $1 to make a direct deposit to each
employee’s account, which can add up if there are many employees and fre-
quent pay periods (e.g., once a week). Also, some paper-based form of notifi-
cation must still be sent to employees so that they know the details of what
they have been paid. This means that using direct deposit does not eliminate
the steps of printing, envelope stuffing, or check distribution (though there is
no need to sign the pay notifications or hold them for stray employees, nor is
there any further trouble with tracking payroll checks that have not been
cashed). Finally, most companies find that they end up with a dual system—
some employees take direct deposit and some go with paper checks—so that
they have a more complicated system with two forms of payment. However,


364 Payroll Best Practices

do not let all these problems shoot down an initiative to use direct deposit. If
one follows through on it properly, then most or all employees can still be con-
verted to it over the long term. Despite its disadvantages, direct deposit can be
a clear advantage to both the accounting department and employees, if prop-
erly implemented.

17-17 AUTOMATE VACATION ACCRUALS

The topic that is of the most interest to the most employees is how much vacation
time they have left. In most companies, this information is kept manually by the
payroll staff, so employees troop down to the payroll department once a month
(and more frequently in the prime summer vacation months!) to see how much
vacation time they have left to use. When employees are constantly coming in to
find out this information, it is a major interruption to the payroll staff, because it
happens at all times of the day, never allowing them to settle down into a com-
fortable work routine. If there are many employees who want to know about their
vacation time, it can be a considerable loss of efficiency for the payroll staff.

A simple way to keep employees from bothering the payroll staff is to
include the vacation accrual in employee paychecks. The information appears on
the payroll stub, and shows the annual amount of accrued vacation, net of any
used time. By feeding this information to employees in every paycheck, there is
no need for them to inquire about it in the payroll office, eliminating a major hin-
drance. However, there are several points to consider before automating vacation
accruals. The first one is that the payroll system must be equipped with a vacation
accrual calculation option. If not, the software must be modified with custom
programming to allow for the calculation and presentation of this information,
which may cost more to implement than the projected efficiency savings. Another
problem is that the accrual system must be set up properly for each employee
when it is originally installed, or else there will be a number of outraged employ-
ees crowding into the payroll office, causing more disruption than was the case
before. This start-up problem is caused by having employees with different num-
bers of days of vacation allowed per year, as well as some with carryover vaca-
tion from the previous year. If this information is not accurately reflected in the
automated vacation accrual system when it is implemented, employees will has-
ten to the payroll area to correct this problem at once. Another problem is that the
accruals must be adjusted over time to reflect changes. Otherwise, once again,
employees will interrupt the staff to notify them of changes, thereby offsetting
the value of the entire system. For example, an employee may switch from two to
three weeks of allowed vacation at the fifth anniversary of his or her hiring. The
payroll department must have a schedule of when this person’s vacation accrual
amount changes to the three-week level, or the employee will come in and com-

plain about it. If these problems can be overcome, using vacation accruals
becomes a relatively simple means of improving the efficiency of the payroll
department.

17-18 CONSOLIDATE PAYROLL SYSTEMS V Author’s Choice

A company that grows by acquisition is likely to have a number of payroll sys-
tems—one for each company that it has acquired. This situation may also arise
for highly decentralized companies that allow each company location to set up its
own payroll system. Though this approach does allow each location to process
payroll in accordance with its own rules and payment periods, while also allow-
ing for local maintenance of employee records, there are several serious problems
that can be solved by the consolidation of all these systems into a single, central-
ized payroll system.

One problem with having many payroll systems is that employee payroll
records cannot be shifted through a company when an employee is transferred to
a new location. Instead, the employee is listed as having been terminated in the
payroll system of the location that he or she is leaving and is then listed as a new
hire in the payroll system of the new location. By constantly reentering an
employee as a new hire, it is impossible to track the dates and amounts of pay
raises; the same problem arises for the human resources staff, who cannot track
eligibility dates for medical insurance or vesting periods for pension plans. In
addition, every time employee data is reentered into a different payroll system,
there is a risk of data inaccuracies that may result in such embarrassments as
wrong pay rates or mailing checks to the wrong address. Also, a company cannot
easily group data for companywide payroll reporting purposes. For all these rea-
sons, it is common practice to consolidate payroll systems into a single, central-
ized location that operates with a single payroll database.

Before embarking on such a consolidation, one must consider the costs of
implementation. One is that a consolidation of many payroll systems may require
an expensive new software package that must run on a large computer, which
entails extra capital and software maintenance costs. In addition, there is probably a
significant cost associated with converting the data from the disparate databases
into the new consolidated one. In addition, there may be extra time needed to test
the tax rates for all company locations, in order to avoid penalties for improper tax
withholdings and submissions. Finally, the timing of the implementation is of some
importance. Many companies prefer to make the conversion on the first day of the
new year so that there is no need to enter detailed pay information into the system
for the prior year to issue year-end payroll tax reports to the government. The cost
of consolidating payroll systems is considerable and must be carefully analyzed
before the decision to convert is reached.


366 Payroll Best Practices

Switching from many payroll systems to a single one is an excellent best prac-
tice to implement, with many long-term benefits. However, due to the conversion
cost, it is important to weigh the costs and benefits of the project and to insert the
project into a company’s capital budget only when the funds are definitely available.

17-19 ELIMINATE PERSONAL LEAVE DAYS

A common task for the payroll staff is to either manually or automatically track
the vacation time employees earn and use. Depending on the level of automation,
this task can require some portion of staff time every week on an ongoing basis.
Some companies then take the additional step of accruing and tracking the usage
of personal leave days, which are essentially the same thing as vacation time, but
tracked under a different name. By having both vacation and personal leave days,
the payroll staff is reduced to tracking data in both categories, which doubles the
work required to simply track vacation time.

A reasonable, and easily implemented, best practice is to convert personal
leave days into vacation days and eliminate the extra category of time off. By
doing so, the payroll staff can cut in half the time it devotes to analyzing
employee vacation time. The only resistance to this change usually comes from
the human resources department, which likes to offer a variety of benefits to
match those other companies offer; for example, if a competitor offers personal
leave days, then so should the company. Though only a matter of semantics, this
can cause a problem when implementing the simpler system.

17-20 LINK PAYROLL CHANGES TO EMPLOYEE EVENTS

There are many payroll changes that must be made when certain events occur in
an employee file. Many of these changes are never made, because either the pay-
roll staff is so busy with the standard, daily processing of information that it has
no time to address them or the payroll staff does not possess enough knowledge
to link the payroll changes to the employee events. For example, when an
employee is married, this should trigger a change in that person’s W-4 form, so
that the amount of taxes withheld will reflect those for a married person. Automa-
tion can create many of these linkages. Here are some examples:

¢ As soon as an employee reaches the age of 55, the system issues a notification
to the pension manager to calculate the person’s potential pension, while also
notifying the employee of his or her pension eligibility. These notifications


17-21 Link the 401(k) Plan to the Payroll System 367

can be by letter, but a linkage between the payroll system and the e-mail system
could result in more immediate notification.

¢ As soon as an employee has been with a company for 90 days, his or her period
of probation has been completed. The system should then automatically
include the employee in the company’s dental, medical, and disability plans,
and include deductions for these amounts in the person’s paycheck. Similarly,
the system can automatically enroll the employee in the company’s 401(k)
plan and enter the deductions in the payroll system. Since these pay changes
should not come as a surprise to the employee, the system should also generate
a message to the employee, detailing the changes made and their net payroll
impact.

¢ When acompany is informed of an employee’s marriage, the computer system
generates a notice to the employee that a new W-4 form should be filled out,
while also sending a new benefit enrollment form, in case the employee wishes
to add benefits for the spouse or any children. Finally, a notification message
can ask the employee if he or she wants to change the beneficiary’s name on
the pension plan to that of the spouse.

¢ When an employee notifies the company of an address change, the system
automatically notifies all related payroll and benefit suppliers of the change,
such as the 401(k) plan administrator and health insurance provider.

¢ When a new employee is hired, the system sends a message to the purchasing
department, asking that business cards be ordered for the employee. Another
message goes to the information systems department, requesting that the
appropriate levels of system security be set up for the new hire. Yet another
message goes to the training department, asking that a training plan be set
up for the new employee.

Many of these workflow features are available on high-end accounting and
human resources software packages. However, this software costs more than a mil-
lion dollars in most cases, and so is well beyond the purchasing capability of many
smaller companies. An alternative is to customize an existing software package to
include these features, but the work required will be expensive. Accordingly, these
changes should only be contemplated if there are many employees, since this
would result in a sufficient volume of savings to justify the added expense.

Cost: SFIIFS Installation time:
17-21 LINK THE 401(K) PLAN TO THE PAYROLL SYSTEM

A common activity for the payroll staff is to take the 401(k) deduction informa-
tion from the payroll records as soon as each payroll cycle is completed, enter it
into a separate database for 401(k) deductions, copy this information onto a
diskette, and send it to the company’s 401(k) administration supplier, who uses it


368 Payroll Best Practices

to determine the investment levels of all employees, as well as for discrimination
testing. This can be a lengthy data-entry process if there are many employees,
and it is certainly not a value-added activity when the core task is simply moving
data from one database to another one.

The best way to avoid retyping 401(k) payroll deductions is to link the pay-
roll system directly into a 401(k) plan. This is done by outsourcing the payroll
processing function to a supplier that also offers a 401(k) plan. A good example
of this is Automated Data Processing (ADP), which offers linkages to a number
of well-known mutual funds through its payroll system. When a company uses
ADP’s payroll and 401(k) services, a payroll department can record a 401(k) pay-
roll deduction for an employee just once and ADP will then take the deduction
and automatically move it into a 401(k) fund, with no additional bookkeeping
required from the payroll staff. For those companies with many employees, this
can represent a significant reduction in the workload of the payroll staff.

There are two problems with this best practice. One is that a company must
first outsource its payroll function to a supplier that offers 401(k) administration
services, which the company controller may not be willing to do (see the ““Out-
source the Payroll Function” section later in this chapter). The second problem is
converting to the new 401(k) plan. To do so, all employees in the old plan must be
moved to the new plan. The associated paperwork may be great enough to not
make the transition worthwhile; also, the old 401(k) administrator may require a
separation fee if the company is terminating its services inside of a minimum time
interval, which may involve a small penalty payment. These issues should be con-
sidered before switching to a centralized payroll and 401(k) processing system.

Linking the 401(k) plan to the payroll system is worth considering for those
companies that have already outsourced their payroll processing, since it eliminates
the manual movement of data from the payroll database to the 401(k) database.

17-22 LINK THE PAYROLL AND HUMAN
RESOURCES DATABASES

The payroll database shares many data elements with the human resources
database. Unfortunately, these two databases are usually maintained by differ-
ent departments — accounting for the first and human resources for the second.
Consequently, any employee who makes a change to one database, such as an
address field in the payroll system, must then walk to the human resources
department to have the same information entered again for other purposes, such
as benefits administration or a pension plan. Thus, there is an obvious ineffi-
ciency for the employee who must go to two departments for changes, while
the accounting and human resources staffs also duplicate each other’s data-
entry efforts.


17-23 Minimize Payroll Cycles 369

The obvious best practice here is to tie the two databases together. This can
be done by purchasing a software package that automatically consolidates the
two databases into a single one, but the considerable cost of buying and imple-
menting an entirely new software package will grossly exceed the cost savings
obtained by consolidating the data. A less costly approach is to create an inter-
face between the two systems that automatically stores changes made to each
database and updates the other one as a daily batch program. Creating this inter-
face can still be expensive, since it involves a reasonable amount of customized
programming work. Consequently, consolidating the payroll and human
resources databases is an expensive proposition and is usually done only when
both computer systems are being brought together for more reasons than a sim-
ple reduction in data-entry work.

17-23 MINIMIZE PAYROLL CYCLES V Author's Choice

Many payroll departments are fully occupied with processing some kind of pay-
roll every week and possibly even several times in one week. This situation arises
when different groups of employees are paid for different time periods. For
example, hourly employees may be paid every week, whereas salaried employees
may be paid twice a month. In addition, the employees of acquired companies
may be paid in accordance with the pay periods that were in existence prior to
their acquisition. Processing multiple payroll cycles eats up most of the free time
of the payroll staff, leaving it with little room for cleaning up paperwork or
researching improvements to its basic operations.

An excellent best practice that eliminates a considerable amount of ineffi-
ciency is to consolidate the payroll cycles into a single, companywide cycle. By
doing so, the payroll staff no longer have to spend extra time on additional pay-
roll processing, nor do they have to worry about the different pay rules that may
apply to each processing period—everyone is treated exactly the same. To make
payroll processing even more efficient, it is useful to lengthen the payroll cycles.
For example, a payroll department that processes weekly payrolls must run the
payroll 52 times a year, whereas one that processes monthly payrolls only does
so 12 times a year, which eliminates 75 percent of the processing that the first
department must handle. These changes represent an enormous reduction in the
payroll-processing time the accounting staff requires.

Prior to reducing the number of payroll cycles, however, one must bring up
the issue with employees, who may have a considerable number of objections.
The main complaint will be that employees have structured their spending habits
around the old pay system. For example, employees who currently receive a pay-
check every week may have a great deal of difficulty in adjusting their spending
to a paycheck that only arrives once a month. If a company were to make a switch
from a short to a long pay cycle, it is extremely likely that the payroll staff will be


370 Payroll Best Practices

deluged with requests for pay advances well before the next paycheck is due for
release, which will require a large amount of effort to handle. To overcome this
problem, many companies will only lengthen their pay cycles incrementally, usu-
ally to once every two weeks or twice a month, and make it clear to employees
that pay advances will be granted for a limited transition period. By making these
incremental changes, a company can keep the level of employee discontent to a
minimum.

Another implementation point is to make sure that the rest of the manage-
ment team is supportive of the length of the new payroll cycle. They must buy
into the program because all of their employees will be impacted by the change.
If they receive an inordinate volume of complaints from their employees about
this issue, they may argue against the change; if enough of them do that, this best
practice may never succeed.

In short, consolidating and lengthening payroll cycles is an excellent method
for making a significant improvement to the efficiency of the payroll staff, but it
must be done with the full approval of the management team and with adequate
forewarning of all company employees.

17-24 OUTSOURCE THE PAYROLL FUNCTION WV Author’s Choice

A typical in-house payroll department has many concerns. Besides the task of
issuing paychecks, it may have to do so for many company locations, where tax
rates differ, employees are paid on different dates, and tax payments must be
made to state governments by different means (e.g., direct deposit, bank deposit,
or mail), and W-2 forms must be issued to all employees at the beginning of each
year. Of all these issues, the one carrying the heaviest price for failure is a gov-
ernment tax deposit— missing such a payment by just one day can carry a large
penalty that rapidly accumulates in size. All of these problems and costs can be
avoided by handing over some or all portions of the payroll function to an outside
supplier.

Payroll is one of the most commonly outsourced company functions. There
are several good reasons for this. First, a supplier will undertake to pay all payroll
taxes without troubling the company. The savings from avoiding government
penalties for late tax payments will, in some cases, pay for the cost of the payroll
supplier! In addition, the supplier can usually process payroll for all company
locations; several suppliers are based in all major cities, so they can handle pay-
check deliveries to nearly any location. Other smaller suppliers get around not
having multiple locations by sending checks to company locations with overnight
delivery services—either approach works well. Another advantage is that nearly
all payroll suppliers can deposit payments directly into employee bank accounts,
which is something that many in-house payroll systems, especially the smaller


17-25 Use Web-Based Payroll Outsourcing 371

ones, are incapable of performing. In addition, the time-consuming task of stuff-
ing checks into envelopes is one that many suppliers will handle, thereby freeing
up the internal staff for less mundane work. A typical supplier also provides a
wide array of reports, usually including a report-writing package that can address
any special reporting needs. Once again, many smaller in-house payroll systems
lack a report-writing package, so this can be a real benefit. If these advantages are
not enough, one must also remember that payroll suppliers are staffed with a
large team of experts who know all about the intricacies of payroll. They can
answer payroll questions over the phone, provide specialized or standard training
classes, or come out to company locations for hands-on consulting. The wide
array of benefits has convinced thousands of companies to switch to an out-
sourced payroll solution.

However, before jumping on the outsourcing bandwagon, one must consider
a few reasons for not using a payroll supplier. One is that outsourcing is generally
more expensive than an in-house solution. The reason is that the supplier must
spend funds on marketing its services and must make a profit—two items that an
in-house payroll staff does not have to include in its budget. A supplier will usu-
ally sell its services to a company by offering an apparently cheap deal with a
small set of baseline services, and then charge high fees for add-on services, such
as direct deposit, check stuffing, early check deliveries, report-writing software,
and extra human resources additions to the payroll software. As long as a com-
pany is well aware of these extra fees and budgets them into its initial cost-bene-
fit calculations, there should be no surprises later on, as more supplier services
are added and fees continue to rise. The other main problem with outsourcing is
that the payroll database cannot be linked to a company’s other computer sys-
tems. Since a company’s payroll data is usually located in a mainframe computer
at an off-site supplier location, it is nearly impossible to create an interface that
will allow for user access to payroll data. The best alternative (though a poor one)
is to either keypunch the most important data into a company payroll database
from payroll reports printed by the supplier or to download data from the sup-
plier’s computer. Because of this missing database linkage, a number of larger
companies prefer to keep their payroll-processing work in-house.

In short, there are many good reasons for a company to outsource its payroll
function to a qualified supplier. The only companies that should not do so are
those that are either highly sensitive to the cost of payroll processing or those that
must link their payroll data to other computer databases.

17-25 USE WEB-BASED PAYROLL OUTSOURCING

Payroll processing has been the most common accounting function to outsource
for many years. However, it suffers from several deficiencies, such as having to


372 Payroll Best Practices

send in information to the payroll supplier only on certain days, or (if the amount
of information is minimal) waiting for a supplier representative to call, so that the
information can be conveyed over the phone. In addition, any information that is
verbally conveyed to the supplier runs the risk of being incorrect, since an addi-
tional person is involved in the data entry. Yet another problem is that the supplier
will typically run the payroll in a batch-processing run that evening, and then
deliver the completed payroll to the company one or two days later, which is the
earliest point at which the accounting staff knows the exact amount of its payroll
liability, which it needs for cash management purposes.

To get around these problems, it is now possible to process one’s payroll
over the Internet. This involves accessing a supplier’s Web site, entering payroll
and time card information on the spot, and gaining access to fully processed pay-
roll information immediately. This approach also allows one to enter payroll
information at any time of the day or night, and to avoid additional data-entry
problems that are caused by the use of an extra data-entry person by the supplier.

A particularly fine benefit to this approach is the lack of need for any soft-
ware that must be installed on a computer in the accounting department. This
software is needed for traditional outsourced payroll processing, where the data-
entry is conducted by an accounting clerk into a local computer, and then
uploaded to the supplier through a modem. This software may be incompatible
with other operating or application software on the computer, generally requires
that the computer be reserved for payroll use (since it contains sensitive informa-
tion), must be updated as the supplier issues new software versions, and costs
money—payroll suppliers will charge several hundred dollars to give participat-
ing companies the “privilege” of using it.

The main downside to Web-based payroll processing is that it can be difficult
to access or process if there is a poor Internet connection. Also, as is the case for
any outsourced payroll, the payroll information is kept separate from other
accounting information in the company’s central database, so it is difficult to com-
bine payroll information with other types of information for reporting purposes.

This type of payroll processing is offered by PayMaxx Inc. (www.paymaxx.
com), Ceridian Corp. (www.ceridiansmallbusiness.com), and the Emerging Busi-
ness Services division of Automatic Data Processing Inc. (www.ebs.adp.com).

TOTAL IMPACT OF BEST PRACTICES
ON THE PAYROLL FUNCTION

This section selects many of the preceding best practices and merges them into
a sample payroll department, in order to show the overall impact of best prac-
tices on the payroll function. Not all of the best practices are shown here
because some are mutually exclusive. Though the solution presented would


Total Impact of Best Practices on the Payroll Function 373

work well for most companies, a careful controller should review all of the best
practices presented in this section and modify the payroll system discussed in
this section, thereby arriving at a system that fits the particular needs of his or
her company more exactly.

When selecting those best practices from the previous list in order to con-
struct a more efficient system, it rapidly becomes apparent that the overall trend
of the best practices is to streamline the existing payroll system by paring away
unnecessary functions. Accordingly, this section notes a number of tasks that can
be completely dispensed with. These items are noted down the left side of Exhibit
17.3 with a line through them, denoting processes that have been eliminated from
the payroll processing system.

As noted in Exhibit 17.3, a fully streamlined payroll function should avoid
any additional tracking time for job costing, avoid special entries for employee
advances, not include additional calculations for personal leave days, eliminate
deductions for employee purchases, and avoid manual vacation accruals, as well
as the manual tracking of vacation and sick time—in short, one must strip this
function down to the single key task of calculating employee pay, which is what
it was originally intended to do.

Even the simple task of calculating pay can be further reduced so that more
automation and fewer paychecks keep the amount of manual intervention to a
minimum. As noted in Exhibit 17.3, a bar coded time clock can be used to avoid
the manual entry of employee time cards, while employees can be allowed direct
access to their deduction information so that they can enter this information on
their own. Once payroll processing is completed, the payroll system can be auto-
matically linked to the human resources and 401(k) databases, which further
reduces the work needed to update multiple databases. Additional automation
includes issuing direct deposit payments or payments to credit cards, as well as
payment remittances by e-mail. All of these extra levels of automation reduce the
labor of the payroll staff to a bare minimum.

An additional improvement is to consolidate all of the diverse payrolls that a
company may have into a single payroll processing run that covers the pay of all
employees, which avoids having the payroll staff get bogged down in constant
payroll calculations, check printings, and distributions. A further enhancement is
to stretch out the time between payroll processing runs by changing the payroll
frequency from as low as once a week to possibly as long as once a month. These
steps will keep the payroll staff from spending all its time processing payroll data.

The sum total of all these changes can transform an overwhelmed payroll
department into one that focuses on a minimal number of tasks, handles far fewer
transactions, experiences a minimal number of errors requiring correction, and
probably needs fewer employees—in short, one arrives at a low-cost and very
efficient payroll processing engine.


374 Payroll Best Practices

SUMMARY

This chapter primarily dealt with a variety of techniques for streamlining an
existing payroll system. Central to the recommended changes were the concepts
of reduced manual labor and centralized systems, both of which have the net
impact of greatly reducing the workload of the payroll staff. Examples of reduc-
ing the amount of manual labor are shifting deduction changes to employees, as
well as automating vacation accruals. Examples of centralized systems include
merging all payroll systems into one system and combining the human resources

database with the payroll database. Though few companies would implement all
of the best practices listed in this chapter, given the variations in how payroll is
processed in some industries, there are still many techniques listed here that a
payroll manager should strongly consider installing.

Some of the best practices noted in this chapter work to the detriment of
employees. For example, in order to streamline the payroll function, a company
may do away with employee purchases and payroll advances, since these require
extra monitoring work from the payroll staff. However, if a company is in an
industry or geographical region where qualified employees are in short supply, it
may be a reasonable decision by the management team to allow these inefficien-
cies to continue, rather than to run the risk of losing employees over such minor
streamlining changes. Because of the impact on employees of many payroll best
practices, it is wise to consult with senior management prior to making any sig-
nificant changes and not to be surprised if the decision handed back is to leave the
payroll situation as it is, despite the higher levels of inefficiency.
