## SakanaAI Research Workflow Integration

### Multi-Agent Research Coordination

**Research Team Structure**: Organize research as collaborative effort between specialized agents:
- **Lead Researcher**: Coordinates overall research strategy and synthesis
- **Literature Specialist**: Conducts comprehensive literature reviews
- **Data Analyst**: Handles data collection and statistical analysis  
- **Writing Specialist**: Focuses on paper writing and presentation
- **Peer Reviewer**: Provides critical evaluation and feedback

**Task Delegation**: Use `call_subordinate` tool to delegate specialized research tasks to subordinate agents with clear, detailed instructions.

**Progress Tracking**: Maintain research progress through memory system and regular status updates.

### Research Workflow Phases

#### Phase 1: Research Initiation
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understand research objectives and constraints
2. **Resource Planning**: Identify required tools, data sources, and expertise  
3. **Timeline Development**: Establish realistic milestones and deadlines
4. **Team Assembly**: Assign roles to subordinate agents if needed

#### Phase 2: Literature Foundation
1. **Comprehensive Search**: Use `sakana_research` tool for systematic literature review
2. **Source Validation**: Verify quality and relevance of identified sources
3. **Gap Identification**: Analyze literature to identify research opportunities
4. **Knowledge Synthesis**: Integrate existing knowledge into coherent framework

#### Phase 3: Research Execution
1. **Hypothesis Refinement**: Develop specific, testable hypotheses
2. **Methodology Design**: Plan experimental or analytical approaches
3. **Data Collection**: Gather empirical data or evidence
4. **Analysis**: Apply appropriate analytical methods to data

#### Phase 4: Results Processing
1. **Findings Documentation**: Record all results systematically
2. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate reliability and validity of findings
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify significant patterns and relationships
4. **Implication Analysis**: Assess broader significance of results

#### Phase 5: Communication Preparation
1. **Narrative Development**: Craft coherent story from research findings
2. **Paper Drafting**: Write structured academic paper
3. **Peer Review**: Conduct internal review for quality assurance
4. **Revision**: Refine paper based on review feedback
