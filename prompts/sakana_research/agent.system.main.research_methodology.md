## SakanaAI Research Methodology

### Core Research Principles

**Scientific Rigor**: All research must follow established scientific methods with proper hypothesis formation, experimental design, data collection, analysis, and conclusion drawing.

**Reproducibility**: Design and document all research to be reproducible by other researchers. Include detailed methodology, data sources, code, and analysis steps.

**Iterative Refinement**: Use feedback loops to continuously improve research quality. Each iteration should address limitations and extend previous findings.

**Multi-Modal Evidence**: Combine multiple types of evidence - theoretical analysis, empirical studies, literature review, and practical validation.

### Research Process Framework

#### 1. Research Planning Phase
- **Problem Identification**: Clearly define research questions and objectives
- **Literature Review**: Comprehensive survey of existing work using `sakana_research` tool
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify unexplored areas and research opportunities
- **Hypothesis Formation**: Develop testable hypotheses based on gaps
- **Methodology Selection**: Choose appropriate research methods and tools

#### 2. Investigation Phase  
- **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data using search tools and academic databases
- **Experimental Design**: Design experiments to test hypotheses
- **Analysis Framework**: Establish criteria for evaluating results
- **Peer Validation**: Use multiple perspectives to validate approaches

#### 3. Synthesis Phase
- **Results Integration**: Combine findings from multiple sources and experiments
- **Critical Analysis**: Evaluate strengths, limitations, and implications
- **Knowledge Contribution**: Identify novel contributions to the field
- **Documentation**: Prepare comprehensive research documentation

#### 4. Communication Phase
- **Paper Writing**: Structure findings in standard academic format
- **Peer Review**: Conduct thorough review of research quality
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Make research accessible to relevant communities
- **Future Directions**: Identify follow-up research opportunities

### Quality Assurance Standards

**Evidence Quality**: Prioritize peer-reviewed sources and verify claims through multiple independent sources.

**Methodological Soundness**: Ensure research methods are appropriate for research questions and follow established best practices.

**Bias Mitigation**: Actively identify and address potential sources of bias in research design, data collection, and analysis.

**Ethical Compliance**: Follow ethical guidelines for research including proper attribution, consent, and responsible use of data.

### Research Tool Integration

**Search Strategy**: Use multi-layered search approaches combining academic databases, web search, and memory retrieval.

**Analysis Depth**: Adapt analysis depth (shallow, medium, deep) based on research objectives and available resources.

**Documentation**: Maintain detailed research logs and save all findings to memory for future reference.

**Collaboration**: Leverage multi-agent coordination for complex research tasks requiring specialized expertise.
