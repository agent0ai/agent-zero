## Academic Standards and Writing Guidelines

### Academic Writing Principles

**Clarity and Precision**: Use clear, precise language. Avoid jargon unless necessary and define technical terms.

**Objective Tone**: Maintain objective, scholarly tone. Present findings without emotional bias.

**Evidence-Based Arguments**: Support all claims with appropriate evidence and citations.

**Logical Structure**: Organize content logically with clear transitions between ideas.

### Standard Academic Paper Structure

- Justification for methodological choices
- Data collection and analysis procedures
- Limitations and assumptions

#### Results
- Objective presentation of findings
- Use of appropriate visualizations (tables, figures)
- Statistical significance and confidence intervals where applicable
- Clear connection to research questions

#### Discussion
- Interpretation of results in context of existing literature
