### rag_anything:
This tool provides advanced multimodal document processing capabilities using RAG-Anything integration.
It can extract and analyze images, tables, equations, and text from documents with context awareness.

#### Key capabilities:
 * Extract images, tables, and equations from documents with surrounding context
 * Process multiple document formats (PDF, DOC, DOCX, images, etc.)
 * Store multimodal content in semantic memory for later retrieval
 * Query processed content using natural language
 * Batch process multiple documents efficiently
 * Get processing statistics and system status

#### Available methods:
 * **Default/process**: Process a document to extract multimodal content
 * **query**: Search processed content using semantic similarity
 * **status**: Get processing statistics and system status
 * **batch**: Process multiple documents in batch
 * **delete**: Delete processed content for a document

#### Arguments for process method:
 * "document_path" (string): Full path to the document to process
 * "extract_images" (optional, boolean): Extract and process images (default: true)
 * "extract_tables" (optional, boolean): Extract and process tables (default: true) 
 * "extract_equations" (optional, boolean): Extract and process equations (default: true)
 * "store_in_memory" (optional, boolean): Store results in memory for later querying (default: true)

#### Arguments for query method:
 * "query" (string): Natural language query to search for
 * "document_path" (optional, string): Limit search to specific document
 * "content_types" (optional, string): Comma-separated list of content types to filter ("image,table,equation,text")
 * "limit" (optional, number): Maximum number of results (default: 10)

#### Arguments for batch method:
 * "documents" (string): Comma-separated list of document paths to process
 * "extract_images" (optional, boolean): Extract images from all documents (default: true)
 * "extract_tables" (optional, boolean): Extract tables from all documents (default: true)
 * "extract_equations" (optional, boolean): Extract equations from all documents (default: true)

#### Arguments for delete method:
 * "document_path" (string): Path to document whose processed content should be deleted

#### Usage example 1 - Process a document:
##### Request:
```json
{
    "thoughts": [
        "The user wants me to analyze a PDF document that contains charts and tables",
        "I'll use rag_anything to extract all multimodal content with context"
    ],
    "headline": "Processing document for multimodal analysis",

    "tool_name": "rag_anything",
    "tool_args": {
        "method": "query",
        "query": "financial performance tables with revenue data",
        "content_types": "table",
        "limit": 5
    }
}
```
##### Response:
```plaintext
Found 3 results for query: financial performance tables with revenue data

1. [table] from financial_report.pdf
   | Quarter | Revenue | Growth |

   | Q2 2024 | $52M    | 15%    |

2. [table] from financial_report.pdf
   | Region  | Sales   | Margin |
   |---------|---------|--------|
   | North   | $28M    | 23%    |
