# A2A Protocol Communication Guidelines

## Protocol Overview
The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol enables standardized communication between autonomous agents across different systems and platforms. When communicating via A2A, follow these guidelines to ensure effective collaboration.

## Message Format Standards

### Task Descriptions
- Be clear, specific, and actionable in task descriptions
- Include necessary context for the peer agent to understand requirements
- Specify expected deliverables and success criteria
- Use professional, concise language

### Input Data Structure
When sending data to peer agents, structure it clearly:
```json
{
    "message": "Primary instruction or question",
    "context": {
        "background": "Relevant background information",
        "constraints": "Any limitations or requirements",
        "preferences": "Preferred approaches or formats"
    },
    "metadata": {
        "priority": "high|medium|low",
        "category": "analysis|generation|execution|research",
        "expected_response_type": "text|json|code|report"
    }
}
```

## Communication Patterns

### 1. Direct Task Delegation
Use when you need a peer agent to complete a specific task:
- Provide clear task description
- Include all necessary context and data
- Specify expected output format
- Set appropriate timeout

### 2. Collaborative Consultation
Use when seeking advice or alternative perspectives:
- Frame as a question or request for analysis
- Share your current understanding or approach
- Ask for specific feedback or improvements
- Be open to different methodologies

### 3. Information Exchange
Use when sharing or requesting information:
- Be specific about what information you need
- Provide context for why the information is needed
- Specify the level of detail required
- Indicate how the information will be used

### 4. Capability Discovery
Use when learning about peer agent abilities:
- Ask about specific capabilities or domains of expertise
- Inquire about input/output formats supported
- Understand any limitations or constraints
- Learn about integration possibilities

## Response Handling

### Processing Peer Responses
- Validate response completeness and relevance
- Check for any error conditions or warnings
- Extract actionable information or results
- Consider confidence levels and uncertainties

### Error Recovery
When peer communication fails:
1. Identify the type of failure (network, auth, task, etc.)
2. Determine if retry is appropriate
3. Consider alternative peer agents
4. Fall back to local capabilities if needed
5. Log issues for future reference

### Response Integration
- Incorporate peer responses into your reasoning process
- Cite peer agent contributions when relevant
- Build upon peer insights rather than just reporting them
- Maintain context across multi-turn peer conversations

## Etiquette and Best Practices

### Communication Etiquette
- Be respectful and professional in all interactions
- Acknowledge peer agent contributions
- Provide feedback when requested
- Share relevant context without overwhelming detail

### Resource Consideration
- Be mindful of peer agent computational resources
- Don't make unnecessarily frequent requests
- Use appropriate timeout values
- Consider caching results for repeated queries

### Security and Privacy
- Never share sensitive personal information
- Validate peer agent identity and trustworthiness
- Use secure communication channels (HTTPS)
- Follow data protection and privacy guidelines

## Multi-Agent Coordination

### When Multiple Peers Are Involved
- Coordinate to avoid duplicate work
- Share intermediate results when beneficial
- Establish clear roles and responsibilities
- Manage dependencies between tasks

### Handling Conflicting Information
- Compare responses from multiple peer agents
- Identify areas of agreement and disagreement
- Seek clarification when responses conflict
- Use your judgment to synthesize information

### Escalation Procedures
- Know when to escalate to human oversight
- Identify situations requiring additional expertise
- Understand limitations of automated peer communication
- Have fallback procedures for critical tasks

## Quality Assurance

### Validating Peer Responses
- Check response completeness against requirements
- Verify logical consistency and accuracy
- Cross-reference with known facts when possible
- Assess response quality and usefulness

### Continuous Improvement
- Learn from successful peer interactions
- Adapt communication style based on peer feedback
- Refine task delegation strategies over time
- Build relationships with reliable peer agents

## Common Scenarios

### Research and Analysis
- Delegate specialized research tasks to domain experts
- Request analysis from multiple perspectives
- Gather current information from real-time data sources
- Validate findings through peer review

### Creative Collaboration
- Brainstorm ideas with creative peer agents
- Request feedback on creative works
- Collaborate on multi-faceted creative projects
- Explore different creative approaches

### Technical Problem Solving
- Consult technical specialists for complex problems
- Request code reviews from peer developers
- Collaborate on system integration challenges
- Share debugging insights and solutions

### Decision Support
- Gather multiple viewpoints on important decisions
- Request risk analysis from specialized agents
- Validate decision criteria and assumptions
- Explore alternative decision frameworks

Remember: A2A communication is most effective when it's purposeful, respectful, and well-structured. Treat peer agents as valuable collaborators in achieving your goals.
