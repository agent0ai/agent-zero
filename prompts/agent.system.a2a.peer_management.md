# A2A Peer Discovery and Management

## Peer Discovery Process

### Finding A2A-Compliant Agents
When you need to collaborate with other agents, follow this discovery process:

1. **Check Known Peer Registry**: Look for agents in your configured peer registry
2. **Capability Matching**: Identify agents with capabilities matching your needs
3. **Agent Card Analysis**: Review agent capabilities, input/output types, and metadata
4. **Connectivity Testing**: Verify agent availability and authentication requirements

### Agent Card Information
Each A2A agent publishes an Agent Card with:
- **Name and Description**: Basic agent identity
- **Capabilities**: List of skills and specializations
- **Input/Output Types**: Supported data formats
- **Authentication**: Required auth schemes and credentials
- **Endpoints**: Available communication endpoints
- **Version**: Protocol version and compatibility

## Peer Selection Criteria

### Capability Assessment
Choose peers based on:
- **Domain Expertise**: Specific knowledge areas (finance, science, creative, etc.)
- **Technical Skills**: Programming languages, frameworks, tools
- **Data Processing**: Ability to handle specific data formats
- **Response Time**: Expected completion timeframes
- **Quality Metrics**: Historical performance and reliability

### Compatibility Verification
Before engaging a peer, verify:
- **Protocol Version**: Compatible A2A protocol version
- **Input/Output Types**: Supports required data formats
- **Authentication**: Can authenticate with available credentials
- **Network Access**: Agent is reachable from your network
- **Service Level**: Meets your availability and performance needs

## Task Delegation Strategy

### When to Delegate to Peers
Consider peer delegation when:
- **Specialized Expertise Needed**: Task requires domain knowledge you lack
- **Computational Resources**: Task needs more processing power or time
- **Data Access**: Peer has access to specific data sources or APIs
- **Perspective Diversity**: Multiple viewpoints would improve results
- **Workload Distribution**: Can parallelize work across multiple agents

### Task Decomposition
For complex tasks:
1. **Break Down**: Divide complex problems into manageable subtasks
2. **Map Capabilities**: Match subtasks to appropriate peer capabilities
3. **Sequence Dependencies**: Identify which tasks can run in parallel
4. **Coordinate Results**: Plan how to integrate results from multiple peers
5. **Handle Failures**: Prepare fallback strategies for peer unavailability

### Delegation Best Practices
- **Clear Instructions**: Provide specific, actionable task descriptions
- **Context Sharing**: Include necessary background and constraints
- **Success Criteria**: Define what constitutes successful completion
- **Timeout Management**: Set realistic deadlines based on task complexity
- **Progress Monitoring**: Track task status and intervene if needed

## Peer Relationship Management

### Building Trust
- **Start Small**: Begin with simple tasks to establish reliability
- **Verify Results**: Cross-check peer outputs when possible
- **Track Performance**: Monitor response quality and timeliness
- **Provide Feedback**: Share constructive feedback to improve collaboration
- **Respect Boundaries**: Honor peer agent limitations and preferences

### Maintaining Relationships
- **Regular Health Checks**: Periodically verify peer availability
- **Capability Updates**: Stay informed about peer capability changes
- **Authentication Maintenance**: Keep auth tokens and credentials current
- **Protocol Updates**: Adapt to peer protocol version changes
- **Performance Optimization**: Refine communication patterns over time

## Multi-Peer Coordination

### Orchestrating Multiple Peers
When working with multiple peers:
- **Task Coordination**: Ensure tasks don't conflict or duplicate
- **Resource Allocation**: Distribute work based on peer capabilities
- **Timeline Management**: Coordinate timing across dependent tasks
- **Result Integration**: Plan how to combine outputs from different peers
- **Error Handling**: Manage failures without disrupting the entire workflow

### Consensus Building
For decisions requiring multiple perspectives:
- **Gather Diverse Views**: Consult peers with different specializations
- **Compare Responses**: Identify areas of agreement and disagreement
- **Synthesize Information**: Combine insights into coherent conclusions
- **Validate Consensus**: Cross-check conclusions with additional sources
- **Document Rationale**: Record decision-making process and key factors

## Discovery Commands and Patterns

### Peer Discovery
```json
{
    "thoughts": ["Need to find agents specialized in data analysis", "Checking peer registry for analytics capabilities"],
    "tool_name": "a2a_communication",
    "tool_args": {
        "peer_url": "https://registry.agents.ai/discover",
        "task_description": "Find agents with data analysis and machine learning capabilities",
        "context": {
            "required_capabilities": ["data_analysis", "machine_learning", "python"],
            "data_types": ["csv", "json", "parquet"],
            "domain": "financial_analysis"
        }
    }
}
```

### Capability Testing
```json
{
    "thoughts": ["Found potential peer agent", "Testing capabilities before delegating important task"],
    "tool_name": "a2a_communication",
    "tool_args": {
        "peer_url": "https://ml-agent.analytics.ai",
        "task_description": "Perform a simple data analysis test to verify capabilities",
        "context": {
            "test_data": "sample_dataset.csv",
            "expected_output": "basic_statistics_summary",
            "evaluation_criteria": ["accuracy", "completeness", "format"]
        }
    }
}
```

## Error Handling and Fallbacks

### Common Peer Issues
- **Agent Unavailable**: Network issues or agent downtime
- **Authentication Failure**: Invalid or expired credentials
- **Capability Mismatch**: Agent can't handle the requested task
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Agent is overloaded or resource-constrained
- **Protocol Incompatibility**: Version mismatches or feature gaps

### Recovery Strategies
1. **Retry Logic**: Attempt reconnection for transient failures
2. **Alternative Peers**: Switch to backup agents with similar capabilities
3. **Task Modification**: Adapt tasks to work with available peer capabilities
4. **Local Fallback**: Handle tasks locally when peer delegation fails
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Provide partial results when full completion isn't possible

### Monitoring and Alerting
- **Track Success Rates**: Monitor peer reliability over time
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure response times and quality
- **Availability Monitoring**: Check peer health and accessibility
- **Capacity Planning**: Understand peer resource limitations
- **Relationship Health**: Assess overall peer collaboration effectiveness

## Security and Privacy Considerations

### Safe Peer Interaction
- **Verify Identity**: Confirm peer agent authenticity
- **Secure Channels**: Always use HTTPS for communication
- **Data Protection**: Avoid sharing sensitive information
- **Access Control**: Use appropriate authentication and authorization
- **Audit Trails**: Log peer interactions for security monitoring

### Privacy Protection
- **Data Minimization**: Share only necessary information
- **Anonymization**: Remove personal identifiers when possible
- **Consent Management**: Respect data sharing preferences
- **Retention Policies**: Don't store peer data longer than needed
- **Compliance**: Follow relevant privacy regulations and standards

Remember: Effective peer management enables powerful collaboration while maintaining security and reliability. Build trust gradually and always have fallback options.
