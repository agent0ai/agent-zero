# Agent Init Extensions DOX

## Purpose

- Own backend extensions that run when an agent context initializes.

## Ownership

- Ordered Python files own initial UI message setup and profile settings load behavior.

## Local Contracts

- Keep initialization idempotent for contexts that may be restored or reloaded.
- Preserve ordering between initial message creation and profile settings loading.
- `_15_load_profile_settings.py` merges settings from low to high priority: plugin-wide files, bundled profile, plugin profiles, user profile, project-wide file, then project profile. Each plugin layer applies bundled roots before user roots with a stable root-priority sort, preserving same-root discovery order and cached lookup lists. Global framework and `usr/settings.json` files remain excluded; malformed layers log an error and leave other layers usable. Profile and MCP configuration inherit when not explicitly overridden.
- Keep a placeholder user turn (`fw.initial_user_message.md`) ahead of the AI greeting (`fw.initial_message.md`) so `output_langchain` never pops the greeting as a leading `AIMessage`; do not remove either prompt without replacing the turn-order guarantee.
- Minify the initial AI message JSON before storage; preserve raw text as the displayed greeting when JSON parsing fails.
- `_10_initial_message.py` passes `LLMResult.non_llm()` to `hist_add_ai_response` so the Responses-API state seam runs uniformly; the sentinel carries no `response_id` and marks `mode=""`/`state="off"` so stored metadata does not claim a Responses-API turn.
- The synthetic `Hello!` user turn has no UI log. The assistant greeting is displayed as a response log with the same ID as its history message, preserving the log/history link for branching. Keep the user-first seed without duplicating the visible greeting on reload.

## Work Guidance

- Coordinate changes with profile loading, settings resolution, and startup smoke checks.

## Verification

- Smoke-test new chat/context initialization after changes.
- Run `tests/test_plugin_asset_precedence.py` and `tests/test_subagent_profiles.py` for profile-settings changes.
