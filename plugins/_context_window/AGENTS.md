# Context Window Plugin DOX

## Purpose

- Own context-window token accounting, the usage API, the composer indicator,
  its popover, its Interface visibility row, and per-call output speed.

## Ownership

- `helpers/usage.py` owns per-prompt bucket measurement and reconciliation.
- `helpers/output_speed.py` owns output-speed timing and measurement.
- `extensions/python/` records prompt parts at their source extension points,
  preserves terminal streamed usage, captures optional provider usage, and
  times streamed output.
- `api/context_window.py` exposes the active chat's token usage and effective
  model limit without returning prompt content.
- `webui/` and `extensions/webui/` own the Alpine store, indicator, popover,
  model-override refresh, Interface visibility row, and generation-step speed
  label.

## Local Contracts

- The six used-token buckets are `messages`, `system_tools`, `skills`,
  `mcp_tools`, `system_prompt`, and `extras`.
- Tools, MCP tools, and the available-skills catalog are measured from their
  extensible prompt builders, never inferred from rendered headings.
- Loaded skill instructions are removed from Messages and added to Skills.
- Protocol and prompt extras are reported together as Extras.
- Messages reuse the history record token ledger; independently rendered
  fragments use a bounded, content-addressed, runtime-only cache.
- Bucket totals reconcile to the already-stored prompt token total; the
  unclaimed remainder belongs to System prompt.
- If the history ledger would consume the whole prompt estimate, recompute only
  the rendered message portion before reconciliation; ordinary prompt builds
  keep the fast ledger path.
- The prompt estimate never guesses provider-specific image token costs or
  counts embedded image bytes as text.
- Provider price, cache hit, input/output tokens, and output speed form a flat
  summary without diagnostic detail rows.
- Output speed is (provider output tokens - 1) divided by the seconds between
  the first and last streamed delta of one main model call, stamped when Agent
  Zero receives each delta. It excludes time to first token. It is omitted,
  never estimated, when the provider reports no output tokens, the call was
  paused, the window is under one second, or reported reasoning was not
  streamed. A pause is flagged at `handle_intervention`, where the agent
  actually waits.
- Timing relies on two core behaviors: stream callbacks wait out a pause inside
  `handle_intervention`, and `call_chat_model_turn` hands the timed callbacks to
  `unified_turn`, whose usage drain keeps calling them to the terminal chunk.
- The speed joins the generation log item's kvps as `output_speed` at
  `message_loop_result`, after the core and Context Doctor rewrites, so it
  persists with the chat and labels each finished generation step. It is logged
  for handled (`skip_default_processing`) turns too: it describes the call, not
  the result.
- Step speed labels follow the `contextWindowUsage` visibility setting through
  a root `hide-output-speed` class.
- Provider rows are exposed only when the provider or transport reports their
  values; unavailable price and cache data render no row.
- Streaming main turns request LiteLLM's terminal usage event for every
  provider through the transport's `stream_options.include_usage` injection,
  so provider input/output and cache tokens reach the summary. The response
  callback still runs normally; only an actual Chat Completions result
  restores the accepted response after the accounting tail is drained.
- Responses API turns keep their native result and callback behavior unchanged.
- Older chats without a stored breakdown show the explanatory empty state.
- The indicator refreshes once per new Agent 0 generation, after four root-agent
  tool calls without another refresh, when the final response completes the run,
  and when the active chat log GUID changes (including Clear Chat). Streamed
  updates to an existing generation or tool log do not refetch it.
- `_model_config` supplies the effective model limit and the
  `model-context-strip-end` WebUI slot; it does not own this feature's state.
- The `contextWindowUsage` Interface setting defaults to visible on mobile and
  desktop.

## Work Guidance

- Keep prompt accounting out of rendered-text heuristics.
- Keep provider-reported usage separate from the six estimated context buckets.
- Keep the API response limited to counts needed by the UI.
- Preserve the upward, right-aligned popover beside the model/profile selectors. Its minimum strip footprint is bounded by the available width; shared `x-overflow` positions the same popover when the indicator enters the overflow menu. `data-overflow-label` names the entry; `data-overflow-icon` retains its live percentage ring.

## Verification

- Run `conda run -n a0 pytest plugins/_context_window/tests`.
- Smoke-test the indicator, popover, chat switching, post-run refresh,
  generation-step speed labels, and mobile/desktop visibility against the live
  WebUI.
