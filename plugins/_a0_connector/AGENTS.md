# A0 Connector Plugin DOX

## Purpose

- Own the current Agent Zero connector plugin for HTTP and WebSocket integration.
- Provide remote execution, text-editing freshness, and connector runtime bridges.

## Ownership

- `plugin.yaml` owns plugin metadata and settings scope.
- `api/` owns connector WebSocket and API entry points.
- `helpers/` owns chat context, event bridge, execution config, freshness, version, and WebSocket runtime helpers.
- `tools/`, `prompts/`, `skills/`, `extensions/`, and `webui/` own connector-facing agent and UI contributions.

## Local Contracts

- Preserve session-auth and `auth.handlers` activation assumptions.
- Keep remote tool prompts synchronized with remote tool behavior and disclose
  them only from connected CLI metadata: no connected CLI hides all remote tool
  prompts, remote file metadata enables `text_editor_remote`, F4-enabled remote
  execution metadata enables `code_execution_remote`, and supported enabled
  Computer Use that does not need re-arming enables `computer_use_remote`.
- Do not bypass WebSocket authentication or leak connector session data.
- Advertise Launcher gateways additively through HTTP capability
  `launcher_gateway` and WebSocket feature `launcher_gateway_control`. Older
  ordinary CLI clients retain their existing protocol fields and behavior; do
  not provide a partial tools-only fallback when either feature is absent.
- A Launcher `connector_hello` carries a versioned gateway object with kind,
  stable ID, host label, and bounded status. Store it per authenticated socket,
  remove it on disconnect, and let context-bound CLI sockets retain routing
  priority. One unique Launcher gateway may be the global fallback. A duplicate
  socket with the same ID replaces stale state; distinct simultaneous IDs fail
  closed as Multiple hosts.
- `connector_gateway_control` and `connector_gateway_control_result` cover
  master state, complete scope replacement, and Disconnect
  (`emergency_disconnect` on the wire). Protected
  WebUI mutations require CSRF, await the matching acknowledgement, and return
  refreshed status. Apply acknowledged master and scope state to remote file
  and execution routing before resolving the control request; the follow-up
  `connector_hello` only reconciles metadata. Never let the WebUI select a host
  folder or personal browser profile.
- Launcher gateway scopes expose file reading and writing separately. File
  writing depends on reading, and Code execution depends on file writing. Keep
  older gateway declarations without `file_write` read/write compatible.
- Agent Zero WebUI exposes no Launcher gateway icon, menu, status, or control
  bridge. Host access settings, Disconnect/Reconnect, scope changes, and
  Computer Use approval belong only to attached or detached A0 Launcher chrome.
  Keep the authenticated gateway HTTP/WebSocket protocol available for the
  Launcher and connector runtime without adding a Core WebUI surface.
- File operation results may arrive as chunked JSON/base64
  `connector_file_op_result` frames; resolve the pending file operation only
  after all chunks for the `op_id` are assembled.
- Host browser status metadata may advertise `available_browsers` entries with browser ids, labels, CDP endpoints, status, and enabled state; keep older CLI payloads without those fields compatible.
- Model preset definitions exposed through v1 are global; project arguments select scope but never create project-owned definitions. Model switcher state reports the effective main, utility, and embedding models and preserves embedding-change notifications.

## Work Guidance

- Coordinate connector runtime changes with API, tools, prompts, and WebUI viewer behavior together.

## Verification

- Run connector-specific tests or smoke-test HTTP and `/ws` integration when changing runtime behavior.
- Launcher gateway regression coverage lives in
  `tests/test_a0_connector_launcher_gateway.py`.
